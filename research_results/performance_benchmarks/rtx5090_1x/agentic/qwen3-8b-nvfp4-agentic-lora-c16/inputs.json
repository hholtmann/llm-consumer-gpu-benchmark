Octavius ANTONY In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words Witness the hole you made in Caesars heart Crying Long live Hail Caesar CASSIUS Antony The posture of your blows are yet unknown But for your words they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless ANTONY Not stingless too BRUTUS O yes and soundless too For you have stoln their buzzing Antony And very wisely threat before you sting ANTONY Villains you did not so when your vile daggers Hackd one another in the sides of Caesar You showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds And bowd like bondmen kissing Caesars feet Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind Struck Caesar on the neck O you flatterers CASSIUS Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruld OCTAVIUS Come come the cause If arguing makes us sweat The proof of it will turn to redder drops Look I draw a sword against conspirators When think you that the sword goes up again Never till Caesars three and thirty wounds Be well avengd or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors BRUTUS Caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands Unless thou bringst them with thee OCTAVIUS So I hope I was not born to die on Brutus sword BRUTUS O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain Young man thou couldst not die more honourable CASSIUS A peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour Joind with a masker and a reveller ANTONY Old Cassius still OCTAVIUS Come Antony away Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth If you dare fight today come to the field If not when you have stomachs Exeunt Octavius Antony and their Army CASSIUS Why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark The storm is up and all is on the hazard BRUTUS Ho Lucilius Hark a word with you LUCILIUS My lord Brutus and Lucilius talk apart CASSIUS Messala MESSALA What says my General CASSIUS Messala This is my birthday as this very day Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala Be thou my witness that against my will As Pompey was am I compelld to set Upon one battle all our liberties You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage Coming from Sardis on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands Who to Philippi here consorted us This morning are they fled away and gone And in their steads do ravens crows and kites Fly oer our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey their shadows seem A canopy most fatal under which Our army lies ready to give up the ghost MESSALA Believe not so CASSIUS I but believe it partly For I am fresh of spirit and resolvd To meet all perils very constantly BRUTUS Even so Lucilius CASSIUS Now most noble Brutus The gods today stand friendly that we may Lovers in peace lead on our days to age But since the affairs of men rest still incertain Lets reason with the worst that may befall If we do lose this battle then is this The very last time we shall speak together What are you then determined to do BRUTUS Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself I know not how But I do find it cowardly and vile For fear of what might fall so to prevent The time of life arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below CASSIUS Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome BRUTUS No Cassius no think not thou noble Roman That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome He bears too great a mind But this same day Must end that work the Ides of March begun And whether we shall meet again I know not Therefore our everlasting farewell take For ever and for ever farewell Cassius If we do meet again why we shall smile If not why then this parting was well made CASSIUS For ever and for ever farewell Brutus If we do meet again well smile indeed If not tis true this parting was well made BRUTUS Why then lead on O that a man might know The end of this days business ere it come But it sufficeth that the day will end And then the end is known Come ho away Exeunt SCENE II The same The field of battle Alarum Enter Brutus and Messala BRUTUS Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side Loud alarum Let them set on at once for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius wing And sudden push gives them the overthrow Ride ride Messala let them all come down Exeunt SCENE III Another part of the field Alarum Enter Cassius and Titinius CASSIUS O look Titinius look the villains fly Myself have to mine own turnd enemy This ensign here of mine was turning back I slew the coward and did take it from him TITINIUS O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early Who having some advantage on Octavius Took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil Whilst we by Antony are all enclosd Enter Pindarus PINDARUS Fly further off my lord fly further off Mark Antony is in your tents my lord Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off CASSIUS This hill is far enough Look look Titinius Are those my tents where I perceive the fire TITINIUS They are my lord CASSIUS Titinius if thou lovest me Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again that I may rest assurd Whether yond troops are friend or enemy TITINIUS I will be here again even with a thought Exit CASSIUS Go Pindarus get higher on that hill My sight was ever thick Regard Titinius And tell me what thou notest about the field Pindarus goes up This day I breathed first Time is come round And where I did begin there shall I end My life is run his compass Sirrah what news PINDARUS Above O my lord CASSIUS What news PINDARUS Above Titinius is enclosed round about With horsemen that make to him on the spur Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too Hes taen Shout And hark they shout for joyCASSIUS Come down behold no more O coward that I am to live so long To see my best friend taen before my face Pindarus descends Come hither sirrah In Parthia did I take thee prisoner And then I swore thee saving of thy life That whatsoever I did bid thee do Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath Now be a freeman and with this good sword That ran through Caesars bowels search this bosom Stand not to answer Here take thou the hilts And when my face is coverd as tis now Guide thou the swordCaesar thou art revengd Even with the sword that killd thee Dies PINDARUS So I am free yet would not so have been Durst I have done my will O Cassius Far from this country Pindarus shall run Where never Roman shall take note of him Exit Enter Titinius with Messala MESSALA It is but change Titinius for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus power As Cassius legions are by Antony TITINIUS These tidings would well comfort Cassius MESSALA Where did you leave him TITINIUS All disconsolate With Pindarus his bondman on this hill MESSALA Is not that he that lies upon the ground TITINIUS He lies not like the living O my heart MESSALA Is not that he TITINIUS No this was he Messala But Cassius is no more O setting sun As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night So in his red blood Cassius day is set The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done Mistrust of my success hath done this deed MESSALA Mistrust of good success hath done this deed O hateful Error Melancholys child Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not O Error soon conceivd Thou never comst unto a happy birth But killst the mother that engenderd thee TITINIUS What Pindarus where art thou Pindarus MESSALA Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his ears I may say thrusting it For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight TITINIUS Hie you Messala And I will seek for Pindarus the while Exit Messala Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius Did I not meet thy friends And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts Alas thou hast misconstrued everything But hold thee take this garland on thy brow Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I Will do his bidding Brutus come apace And see"

drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture of justice and his bond JESSICA When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonios flesh

is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight Stand by our Ajax As you and Lord Aeneas Consent upon the order of their fight So be it either to the uttermost Or else a breath The combatants being kin Half stints their strife before their strokes begin Ajax and Hector enter the lists ULYSSES They are opposd already AGAMEMNON What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy ULYSSES The youngest son of Priam a true knight Not yet mature yet matchless firm of word Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue Not soon provokd nor being provokd soon calmd His heart and hand both open and both free For what he has he gives what thinks he shows Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath Manly as Hector but more dangerous For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love They call him Troilus and on him erect A second hope as fairly built as Hector Thus says Aeneas one that knows the youth Even to his inches and with private soul Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me Alarum Hector and Ajax fight AGAMEMNON They are in action NESTOR Now Ajax hold thine own TROILUS Hector thou sleepst awake thee AGAMEMNON His blows are well disposd There Ajax Trumpets cease DIOMEDES You must no more AENEAS Princes enough so please you AJAX I am not warm yet let us fight again DIOMEDES As Hector pleases HECTOR Why then will I no more Thou art great lord my fathers sisters son A cousingerman to great Priams seed The obligation of our blood forbids A gory emulation twixt us twain Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so That thou couldst say This hand is Grecian all And this is Trojan the sinews of this leg All Greek and this all Troy my mothers blood Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister Bounds in my fathers by Jove multipotent Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member Wherein my sword had not impressure made Of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay That any drop thou borrowdst from thy mother My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword Be drained Let me embrace thee Ajax By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms Hector would have them fall upon him thus Cousin all honour to thee AJAX I thank thee Hector Thou art too gentle and too free a man I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence A great addition earned in thy death HECTOR Not Neoptolemus so mirable On whose bright crest Fame with her loudst Oyes Cries This is he could promise to himself A thought of added honour torn from Hector AENEAS There is expectance here from both the sides What further you will do HECTOR Well answer it The issue is embracement Ajax farewell AJAX If I might in entreaties find success As seld I have the chance I would desire My famous cousin to our Grecian

as they are made forgot as soon As done Perseverance dear my lord Keeps honour bright To have done is to hang Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail In monumental mockry Take the instant way For honour travels in a strait so narrow Where one but goes abreast Keep then the path For emulation hath a thousand sons That one by one pursue if you give way Or hedge aside from the direct forthright Like to an entred tide they all rush by And leave you hindmost Or like a gallant horse falln in first rank Lie there for pavement to the abject rear Oerrun and trampled on Then what they do in present Though less than yours in past must oertop yours For Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by thhand And with his arms outstretchd as he would fly Grasps in the comer The welcome ever smiles And farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was For beauty wit High birth vigour of bone desert in service Love friendship charity are subjects all To envious and calumniating Time One touch of nature makes the whole world kin That all with one consent praise newborn gauds Though they are made and moulded of things past And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt oerdusted The present eye praises the present object Then marvel not thou great and complete man That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what stirs not The cry went once on thee And still it might and yet it may again If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive And case thy reputation in thy tent Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late Made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves And drave great Mars to faction ACHILLES Of this my privacy I have strong reasons ULYSSES But gainst your privacy The reasons are more potent and heroical Tis known Achilles that you are in love With one of Priams daughters ACHILLES Ha known ULYSSES Is that a wonder The providence thats in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus gold Finds bottom in thuncomprehensive deeps Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles There is a mysterywith whom relation Durst never meddlein the soul of state Which hath an operation more divine Than breath or pen can give expressure to All the commerce that you have had with Troy As perfectly is ours as yours my lord And better would it fit Achilles much To throw down Hector than Polyxena But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home When fame shall in our island sound her trump And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing Great Hectors sister did Achilles win But our great Ajax bravely beat down him Farewell my lord I as your lover speak The fool slides oer the ice that you should break Exit PATROCLUS To this effect Achilles have I movd you A woman impudent and mannish grown Is not more loathd than an effeminate man In time of action I stand condemnd for this They think my little stomach to the war And your great love to me restrains you thus Sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold And like a dewdrop from the lions mane Be shook to air ACHILLES Shall Ajax fight with Hector PATROCLUS Ay and perhaps receive much honour by him ACHILLES I see my reputation is at stake My fame is shrewdly gord PATROCLUS O then beware Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves Omission to do what is necessary Seals a commission to a blank of danger And danger like an ague subtly taints Even then when they sit idly in the sun ACHILLES Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus Ill send the fool to Ajax and desire him Tinvite the Trojan lords after the combat To see us here unarmd I have a womans longing An appetite that I am sick withal To see great Hector in his weeds of peace To talk with him and to behold his visage Even to my full of view Enter Thersites A labour savd THERSITES A wonder ACHILLES What THERSITES Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself ACHILLES How so THERSITES He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing ACHILLES How can that be THERSITES Why a stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say There were wit in this head and twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking The mans undone for ever for if Hector break not his neck i th combat hell breakt himself in vainglory He knows not me I said Good morrow Ajax and he replies Thanks Agamemnon What think you of this man that takes me for the general Hes grown a very land fish languageless a monster A plague of opinion A man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkinACHILLES Thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites THERSITES Who I Why hell answer nobody he professes not answering Speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue ins arms I will put on his presence Let Patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of Ajax ACHILLES To him Patroclus Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmd to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonourd Captain General of the Grecian army Agamemnon Do this PATROCLUS Jove bless great Ajax THERSITES Hum PATROCLUS I come from the worthy Achilles THERSITES Ha PATROCLUS Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent THERSITES Hum PATROCLUS And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon THERSITES Agamemnon PATROCLUS Ay my lord THERSITES Ha PATROCLUS What you say tot THERSITES God buy you with all my heart PATROCLUS Your answer sir THERSITES If tomorrow be a fair day by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other Howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me PATROCLUS Your answer sir THERSITES Fare ye well with all my heart ACHILLES Why but he is not in this tune is he THERSITES No but out of tune thus What music will be in him when Hector has knockd out his brains I know not but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on ACHILLES Come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight THERSITES Let me bear another to his horse for thats the more capable creature ACHILLES My mind is troubled like a fountain stirrd And I myself see not the bottom of it Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus THERSITES Would the fountain of your mind were clear again that I might water an ass at it I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance Exit ACT IV SCENE I Troy A street Enter at one side Aeneas and

Who inward searchd have livers white as milk And these assume but valours excrement To render them redoubted Look on beauty And you shall see tis purchasd by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature Making them lightest that wear most of it So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness often known To be the dowry of a second

gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry sole possessor of my love Is of a king become a banished man And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of Englands trueanointed lawful king This is the cause that I poor Margaret With this my son Prince Edward Henrys heir Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid And if thou fail us all our hope is done Scotland hath will to help but cannot help Our people and our peers are both misled Our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight KING LEWIS Renowned queen with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it off QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay the stronger grows our foe KING LEWIS The more I stay the more Ill succour thee QUEEN MARGARET O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow Enter Warwick KING LEWIS Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence QUEEN MARGARET Our Earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friend KING LEWIS Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France He descends Queen Margaret rises QUEEN MARGARET Ay now begins a second storm to rise For this is he that moves both wind and tide WARWICK From worthy Edward king of Albion My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend I come in kindness and unfeigned love First to do greetings to thy royal person And then to crave a league of amity And lastly to confirm that amity With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister To Englands king in lawful marriage QUEEN MARGARET Aside If that go forward Henrys hope is done WARWICK To Bona And gracious madam in our kings behalf I am commanded with your leave and favour Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue To tell the passion of my sovereigns heart Where fame late entering at his heedful ears Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak Before you answer Warwick His demand Springs not from Edwards wellmeant honest love But from deceit bred by necessity For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice That Henry liveth still but were he dead Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henrys son Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour For though usurpers sway the rule awhile Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs WARWICK Injurious Margaret PRINCE EDWARD And why not Queen WARWICK Because thy father Henry did usurp And thou no more art prince than she is queen OXFORD Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth Who by his prowess conquered all France From these our Henry lineally descends WARWICK Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten Methinks these peers of France should smile at that But for the rest you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years a silly time To make prescription for a kingdoms worth OXFORD Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years And not bewray thy treason with a blush WARWICK Can Oxford that did ever fence the right Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree For shame Leave Henry and call Edward king OXFORD Call him my king by whose injurious doom My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere Was done to death And more than so my father Even in the downfall of his mellowed years When nature brought him to the door of death No Warwick no while life upholds this arm This arm upholds the house of Lancaster WARWICK And I the house of York KING LEWIS Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside While I use further conference with Warwick They stand aloof QUEEN MARGARET Heavens grant that Warwicks words bewitch him not KING LEWIS Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience Is Edward your true king For I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosen WARWICK Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour KING LEWIS But is he gracious in the peoples eye WARWICK The more that Henry was unfortunate KING LEWIS Then further all dissembling set aside Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona WARWICK Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself Myself have often heard him say and swear That this his love was an eternal plant Whereof the root was fixed in virtues ground The leaves and fruit maintained with beautys sun Exempt from envy but not from disdain Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain KING LEWIS Now sister let us hear your firm resolve BONA Your grant or your denial shall be mine To Warwick Yet I confess that often ere this day When I have heard your kings desert recounted Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire KING LEWIS Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwards And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king PRINCE EDWARD To Edward but not to the English king QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend KING LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret But if your title to the crown be weak As may appear by Edwards good success Then tis but reason that I be released From giving aid which late I promised Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield WARWICK Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease Where having nothing nothing can he lose And as for you yourself our quondam queen You have a father able to maintain you And better twere you troubled him than France QUEEN MARGARET Peace impudent and shameless Warwick Proud setter up and puller down of kings I will not hence till with my talk and tears Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love For both of you are birds of selfsame feather Post blowing a horn within KING LEWIS Warwick this is some post to us or thee Enter the Post POST My lord ambassador these letters are for you Sent from your brother Marquess Montague These from our king unto your Majesty And madam these for you from whom I know not They all read their letters OXFORD I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his PRINCE EDWARD Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled I hope alls for the best KING LEWIS Warwick what are thy news And yours fair Queen QUEEN MARGARET Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys WARWICK Mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent KING LEWIS What has your king married the Lady Grey And now to soothe your forgery and his Sends me a paper to persuade me patience Is this th alliance that he seeks with France Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner QUEEN MARGARET I told your majesty as much before This proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honesty WARWICK King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss That I am clear from this misdeed of Edwards No more my king for he dishonours me But most himself if he could see his shame Did I forget that by the house of York My father came untimely to his death Did I let pass th abuse done to my niece Did I impale him with the regal crown Did I put Henry from his native right And am I guerdoned at the last with shame Shame on himself for my desert is honour And to repair my honour lost for him I here renounce him and return to Henry My noble Queen let former grudges pass And henceforth I am thy true servitor I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona And replant Henry in his former state QUEEN MARGARET Warwick these words have turned my hate to love And I forgive and quite

For matching more for wanton lust than honour Or than for strength and safety of our country BONA Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged But by thy help to this distressed queen QUEEN MARGARET Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live Unless thou rescue him from foul despair BONA My quarrel and this English queens are one WARWICK And mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours KING LEWIS And mine

horse and armour ORLEANS You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world DAUPHIN What a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns Chha He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus qui a les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes ORLEANS Hes of the colour of the nutmeg DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus He is pure air and fire and the

is a most absolute and excellent horse DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage ORLEANS No more cousin DAUPHIN Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse

The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of highresolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As

strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou

the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius

disposition QUEEN To please the King I did to please myself I cannot do it Yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as grief Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard Yet again methinks Some unborn sorrow ripe in Fortunes womb Is coming towards me and my inward soul With nothing trembles At something it grieves More than with parting from my lord the King BUSHY Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows Which shows like grief itself but is not so For sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears Divides one thing entire to many objects Like perspectives which rightly gazed upon Show nothing but confusion eyed awry Distinguish form So your sweet Majesty Looking awry upon your lords departure Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail Which looked on as it is is naught but shadows Of what it is not Then thricegracious Queen More than your lords departure weep not More is not seen Or if it be tis with false sorrows eye Which for things true weeps

majesty And well met gentlemen I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland QUEEN Why hopst thou so Tis better hope he is For his designs crave haste his haste good hope Then wherefore dost thou

And with uplifted arms is safe arrived At Ravenspurgh QUEEN Now God in heaven forbid GREEN Ah madam tis too true and that is worse The Lord Northumberland his son young Harry Percy The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby With all their powerful friends are fled to him BUSHY Why have you not proclaimed Northumberland And all the rest revolted faction traitors GREEN We have whereupon the Earl of

clock hath stricken three TREBONIUS Tis time to part CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no For he is superstitious grown of late Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustomd terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today DECIUS Never fear that if he be so resolved I can oersway him for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayd with trees And bears with glasses elephants with holes Lions with toils and men with flatterers But

your head And too impatiently stampd with your foot Yet I insisted yet you answerd not But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you So I did Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seemd too much enkindled and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humour Which sometime hath his hour with every man It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevaild on your condition I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of grief BRUTUS I am not well in health and that is all

cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortunes slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like Thus play I

what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy While

an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollos and makes stale the morning Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl Whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships And turnd crownd kings to merchants If youll avouch twas wisdom Paris went As you must needs for you all cried Go go If youll confess he brought home worthy prize As you must needs for you all clappd your hands And cried Inestimablewhy do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate And do a deed that never Fortune did Beggar the estimation which you prizd Richer than sea and land O theft most base That we have stoln what we do fear to keep But thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans cry PRIAM What noise what shriek is this TROILUS Tis our mad sister I do know her voice CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans HECTOR It is Cassandra Enter Cassandra raving CASSANDRA Cry Trojans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes And I will fill them with prophetic tears HECTOR Peace sister peace CASSANDRA Virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to comeCry Trojans cry Practise your eyes with tears Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all Cry Trojans cry A Helen and a woe Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go Exit HECTOR Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse Or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause Can qualify the same TROILUS Why brother Hector We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandras mad Her brainsick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engagd To make it gracious For my private part I am no more touchd than all Priams sons And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain PARIS Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels But I attest the gods your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project For what alas can these my single arms What propugnation is in one mans valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite Yet I protest Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will Paris should neer retract what he hath done Nor faint in the pursuit PRIAM Paris you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights You have the honey still but these the gall So to be valiant is no praise at all PARIS Sir I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wipd off in honourable keeping her What treason were it to the ransackd queen Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms Theres not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamd Where Helen is the subject Then I say Well may we fight for her whom we know well The worlds large spaces cannot parallel HECTOR Paris and Troilus you have both said well And on the cause and question now in hand Have glozd but superficially not much Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distempred blood Than to make up a free determination Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision Nature craves All dues be rendred to their owners Now What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection And that great minds of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills resist the same There is a law in each wellorderd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory If Helen then be wife to Spartas king As it is known she isthese moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back returnd Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong But makes it much more heavy Hectors opinion Is this in way of truth Yet neertheless My spritely brethren I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still For tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignities TROILUS Why there you touchd the life of our design Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector She is a theme of honour and renown A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds Whose present courage may beat down our foes And fame in time to come canonize us For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promisd glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide worlds revenue HECTOR I am yours You valiant offspring of great Priamus I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits I was advertisd their great general slept Whilst emulation in the army crept This I presume will wake him Exeunt SCENE III The Grecian camp Before the tent of Achilles Enter Thersites solus THERSITES How now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he raild at me Sfoot Ill learn to conjure and raise devils but Ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then theres Achilles a rare engineer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunderdarter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which shortarmd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan boneache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say Amen What ho my Lord Achilles Enter Patroclus PATROCLUS Whos there Thersites Good Thersites come in and rail THERSITES If I could a remembred a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slippd out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself The common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue Heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse Ill be sworn and sworn upont she never shrouded any but lazars Amen Wheres Achilles PATROCLUS What art thou devout Wast thou in prayer THERSITES Ay the heavens hear me PATROCLUS Amen Enter Achilles ACHILLES Whos there PATROCLUS Thersites my lord ACHILLES Where where O where Art thou come Why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals Come whats Agamemnon THERSITES Thy commander Achilles Then tell me Patroclus whats Achilles PATROCLUS Thy lord Thersites Then tell me I pray thee whats Thersites THERSITES Thy knower Patroclus Then tell me Patroclus what art thou PATROCLUS Thou must tell that knowest ACHILLES O tell tell THERSITES Ill decline the whole question Agamemnon commands Achilles Achilles is my lord I am Patroclus knower and Patroclus is a fool PATROCLUS You rascal THERSITES Peace fool I have not done"

him And presently go with me to my chamber To take a note of what I stand in need of To furnish me upon my longing journey All that is mine I leave at thy dispose My goods my lands my reputation Only

Thurio give us leave I pray awhile We have some secrets to confer about Exit Thurio Now tell me Proteus whats your will with me PROTEUS My gracious lord that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me undeserving as I am My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend This night intends to steal away your daughter Myself am one made privy to the plot I know you have determined to bestow her On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates And should she thus be stoln away from you It would be much vexation to your age Thus for my dutys sake I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than by concealing it heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down Being unprevented to your timeless grave DUKE Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care Which to requite command me while I live This love of theirs myself have often seen Haply when they have judged me fast asleep And oftentimes have purposed to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so unworthily disgrace the man A rashness that I ever yet have shunned I gave him gentle looks thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosed to me And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested I nightly lodge her in an upper tower The key whereof myself have ever kept And thence she cannot be conveyed away PROTEUS Know noble lord they have devised a mean How he her chamberwindow will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down For which the youthful lover now is gone And this way comes he with it presently Where if it please you you may intercept him But good my lord do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at For love of you not hate unto my friend Hath made me publisher of this pretence DUKE Upon mine honour he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this PROTEUS Adieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming Exit Enter Valentine DUKE Sir Valentine whither away so fast VALENTINE Please it your Grace there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends And I am going to deliver them DUKE Be they of much import VALENTINE The tenor of them do"

admiration They seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes There was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed A notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if th importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more Enter a Gentleman The news Rogero SECOND GENTLEMAN Nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it Here comes the Lady Paulinas steward he can deliver you more Enter a third Gentleman How goes it now sir This news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion Has the king found his heir THIRD GENTLEMAN Most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance That which you hear youll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs The mantle of Queen Hermiones her jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter Did you see the meeting of the two kingsSECOND GENTLEMAN No THIRD GENTLEMAN Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of There might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears There was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries O thy mother thy mother then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns I never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it SECOND GENTLEMAN What pray you became of Antigonus that carried hence the child THIRD GENTLEMAN Like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open He was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherds son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows FIRST GENTLEMAN What became of his bark and his followers THIRD GENTLEMAN Wrecked the same instant of their masters death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found But O the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled She lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing FIRST GENTLEMAN The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted THIRD GENTLEMAN One of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an Alas I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood Who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world could have seen it the woe had been universal FIRST GENTLEMAN Are they returned to the court THIRD GENTLEMAN No the princess hearing of her mothers statue which is in the keeping of Paulinaa piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile Nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup SECOND GENTLEMAN I thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing FIRST GENTLEMAN Who would be thence that has the benefit of access Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge Lets along Exeunt Gentlemen AUTOLYCUS Now had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what But he at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscoverd But tis all one to me for had I been the finderout of this secret it would not have relishd among my other discredits Enter Shepherd and Clown Here come those I have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune SHEPHERD Come boy I am past more children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born CLOWN You are well met sir You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born See you these clothes Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born Give me the lie do and try whether I am not now a gentleman born AUTOLYCUS I know you are now sir a gentleman born CLOWN Ay and have been so any time these four hours SHEPHERD And so have I boy CLOWN So you have but I was a gentleman born before my father for the kings son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed SHEPHERD We may live son to shed many more CLOWN Ay or else twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are AUTOLYCUS I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master SHEPHERD Prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen CLOWN Thou wilt amend thy life AUTOLYCUS Ay an it like your good worship CLOWN Give me thy hand I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia SHEPHERD You may say it but not swear it CLOWN Not swear it now I am a gentleman Let boors and franklins say it Ill swear it SHEPHERD How if it be false son CLOWN If it be neer so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend And Ill swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but Ill swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands AUTOLYCUS I will prove so sir to my power CLOWN Ay by any means prove a tall fellow if I do not wonder how thou darst venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow

services You have paid home but that you have vouchsafd With your crownd brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit It is a surplus of your grace which never My life may last to answer LEONTES O Paulina We honour you with trouble But we came To see the statue of our queen your gallery Have we passd through not without much content In many singularities but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon The statue of her mother PAULINA As she livd peerless So her dead likeness I do well believe Excels whatever yet you lookd upon Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it Lonely apart But here it is prepare To see the life as lively mockd as ever Still sleep mockd death Behold and say tis well Paulina undraws a curtain and discovers Hermione standing as a statue I like your silence it the more shows off Your wonder but yet speak First you my liege Comes it not something near LEONTES Her natural posture Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione or rather thou art she In thy not chiding for she was as tender As infancy and grace But yet Paulina Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing So aged as this"

gracious duke in high despite Laughed in his face and when with grief he wept The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain And after many scorns many foul taunts They took his head and on the gates of York They set the same and there it doth remain The saddest spectacle that eer I viewed EDWARD Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay O Clifford boisterous Clifford thou hast slain The flower of Europe for his chivalry And treacherously hast thou vanquished him For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee Now my souls palace is become a prison Ah would she break from hence that this my body Might in the ground be closed up in rest For never henceforth shall I joy again Never O never shall I see more joy RICHARD I cannot weep for all my bodys moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart Nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen For selfsame wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast And burns me up with flames that tears would quench To weep is to make less the depth of grief Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me Richard I bear thy name Ill venge thy death Or die renowned by attempting it EDWARD His name that valiant duke hath left with thee His dukedom and his chair with me is left RICHARD Nay if thou be that princely eagles bird Show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say Either that is thine or else thou wert not his March Enter Warwick Marquess Montague and their army WARWICK How now fair lords What fare What news abroad RICHARD Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount Our baleful news and at each words deliverance Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told The words would add more anguish than the wounds O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain EDWARD O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet Which held thee dearly as his souls redemption Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death WARWICK Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears And now to add more measure to your woes I come to tell you things sith then befalln After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run Were brought me of your loss and his depart I then in London keeper of the King Mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends And very well appointed as I thought Marched toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen Bearing the King in my behalf along For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in Parliament Touching King Henrys oath and your succession Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met Our battles joined and both sides fiercely foughtBut whether twas the coldness of the King Who looked full gently on his warlike Queen That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen Or whether twas report of her success Or more than common fear of Cliffords rigour Who thunders to his captives blood and death I cannot judge but to conclude with truth Their weapons like to lightning came and went Our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight Or like an idle thresher with a flail Fell gently down as if they struck their friends I cheered them up with justice of our cause With promise of high pay and great rewards But all in vain they had no heart to fight And we in them no hope to win the day So that we fled the King unto the Queen Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself In haste posthaste are come to join with you For in the Marches here we heard you were Making another head to fight again EDWARD Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick And when came George from Burgundy to England WARWICK Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers And for your brother he was lately sent From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy With aid of soldiers to this needful war RICHARD Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit But neer till now his scandal of retire WARWICK Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine Can pluck the diadem from faint Henrys head And wring the awful sceptre from his fist Were he as famous and as bold in war As he is famed for mildness peace and prayer RICHARD I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak But in this troublous time whats to be done Shall we go throw away our coats of steel And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns Numbering our AveMaries with our beads Or shall we on the helmets of our foes Tell our devotion with revengeful arms If for the last say ay and to it lords WARWICK Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out And therefore comes my brother Montague Attend me lords The proud insulting Queen With Clifford and the haught Northumberland And of their feather many moe proud birds Have wrought the easymelting King like wax He swore consent to your succession His oath enrolled in the Parliament And now to London all the crew are gone To frustrate both his oath and what beside May make against the house of Lancaster Their power I think is thirty thousand strong Now if the help of Norfolk and myself With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure Will but amount to five and twenty thousand Why via to London will we march amain And once again bestride our foaming steeds And once again cry Charge upon our foes But never once again turn back and fly RICHARD Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak Neer may he live to see a sunshine day That cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay EDWARD Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean And when thou failstas God forbid the hour Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend WARWICK No longer Earl of March but Duke of York The next degree is Englands royal throne For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed In every borough as we pass along And he that throws not up his cap for joy Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head King Edward valiant Richard Montague Stay we no longer dreaming of renown But sound the trumpets and about our task RICHARD Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds I come to pierce it or to give thee mine EDWARD Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us Enter a Messenger WARWICK How now what news MESSENGER The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me The Queen is coming with a puissant host And craves your company for speedy counsel WARWICK Why then it sorts brave warriors lets away Exeunt SCENE II Before York Flourish Enter King Henry Queen Margaret the Prince of Wales Clifford and Northumberland with drums and trumpets QUEEN MARGARET Welcome my lord to this brave town of York Yonders the head of that archenemy That sought to be encompassed with your crown Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord KING HENRY Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack To see this sight it irks my very soul Withhold revenge dear God Tis not my fault Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow CLIFFORD My gracious liege this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside To whom do lions cast their gentle looks Not to the beast that would usurp their den Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick Not his that spoils her young before her face Who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting Not he that sets his foot upon her back The smallest worm will turn being trodden on And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood Ambitious York did level at thy crown Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows He but a duke would have his son a king And raise his issue like a loving sire Thou being a king blest with a goodly son Didst yield consent to disinherit him Which argued thee a most unloving father Unreasonable creatures feed their young And though mans face be fearful to their eyes Yet in protection of their tender ones Who hath not seen them even with those wings Which sometime they have used with fearful flight Make war with him that climbed unto their nest Offering their own lives in their youngs defence For shame my liege make them your precedent Were it not pity that this goodly boy Should lose his birthright by his fathers fault And long hereafter say unto his child What my greatgrandfather and grandsire got My careless father fondly gave away Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy And let his manly face which promiseth Successful fortune steel thy melting heart To hold thine own and leave thine own with him KING HENRY Full well hath Clifford played the orator Inferring arguments of mighty force But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear That things ill got had ever bad success And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell Ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind And would my father had left me no more For all the rest is held at such a rate As brings a thousandfold more care to keep Than in possession any jot of pleasure Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know How it doth grieve me that thy head is here QUEEN MARGARET My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh And this soft courage makes your followers faint You promised knighthood to our forward son Unsheathe your sword and dub him"

me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex CLAUDIO No I pray thee speak in sober judgment BENEDICK Why i faith methinks shes too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like her CLAUDIO Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her BENEDICK Would you buy her that you enquire after her CLAUDIO Can the world buy such a jewel BENEDICK Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a good harefinder and Vulcan a rare carpenter Come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song CLAUDIO In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on BENEDICK I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter theres her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much

BENEDICK Like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed God forbid it should be so CLAUDIO If my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be otherwise DON PEDRO Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy CLAUDIO You speak this to fetch me in my lord DON PEDRO By my troth I speak my thought CLAUDIO And in faith my lord I spoke mine BENEDICK And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine CLAUDIO That I love her I feel DON PEDRO That she is worthy I know BENEDICK That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake DON PEDRO Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty CLAUDIO And never could maintain his part but in the force of his

Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was beautys summer dead105 Let not my love be called idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my songs and praises be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined One thing expressing leaves out difference Fair kind and true is all my argument Fair kind and true varying to other words And in this change is my invention spent Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords Fair kind and true have often lived alone Which three till now never kept seat in one 106 When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they looked but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we which now behold these present days Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 107 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come Can yet the lease of my true love control Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured And the sad augurs mock their own presage Incertainties now crown themselves assured And peace proclaims olives of endless age Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes And thou in this shalt find thy monument When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 108 Whats in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit Whats new to speak what now to register That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine I must each day say oer the very same Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name So that eternal love in loves fresh case Weighs not the dust and injury of age Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place But makes antiquity for aye his page Finding the first conceit of love there bred Where time and outward form would show it dead 109 O never say that I was false of heart Though absence seemed my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that travels I return again Just to the time not with the time exchanged So that my self bring water for my stain Never believe though in my nature reigned All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood That it could so preposterously be stained To leave for nothing all thy sum of good For nothing this wide universe I call Save thou my rose in it thou art my all 110 Alas tis true I have gone here and there And made my self a motley to the view Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear Made old offences of affections new Most true it is that I have looked on truth Askance and strangely but by all above These blenches gave my heart another youth And worse essays proved thee my best of love Now all is done have what shall have no end Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof to try an older friend A god in love to whom I am confined Then give me welcome next my heaven the best Even to thy pure and most most loving breast 111 O for my sake do you with Fortune chide The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds Thence comes it that my name receives a brand And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in like the dyers hand Pity me then and wish I were renewed Whilst like a willing patient I will drink Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection No bitterness that I will bitter think Nor double penance to correct correction Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me 112 Your love and pity doth th impression fill Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow For what care I who calls me well or ill So you oergreen my bad my good allow You are my all the world and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue None else to me nor I to none alive That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others voices that my adders sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are Mark how with my neglect I do dispense You are so strongly in my purpose bred That all the world besides methinks are dead 113 Since I left you mine eye is in my mind And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function and is partly blind Seems seeing but effectually is out For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch Of his quick objects hath the mind no part Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight The most sweet favour or deformedst creature The mountain or the sea the day or night The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature Incapable of more replete with you My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue 114 Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true And that your love taught it this alchemy To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble Creating every bad a perfect best As fast as objects to his beams assemble O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing And my great mind most kingly drinks it up Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing And to his palate doth prepare the cup If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin 115 Those lines that I before have writ do lie Even those that said I could not love you dearer Yet then my judgement knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer But reckoning time whose millioned accidents Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents Divert strong minds to the course of altring things Alas why fearing of times tyranny Might I not then say Now I love you best When I was certain oer incertainty Crowning the present doubting of the rest Love is a babe then might I not say so To give full growth to that which still doth grow 116 Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove O no it is an everfixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wandring bark Whose worths unknown although his height be taken Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickles compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ nor no man ever loved 117 Accuse me thus that I have scanted all Wherein I should your great deserts repay Forgot upon your dearest love to call Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day That I have frequent been with unknown minds And given to time your own dearpurchased right That I have

jest and never heard before That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth For costs and charges in transporting her She should have staid in France and starved in France Before CARDINAL My Lord of Gloucester now ye grow too hot It was the pleasure of my lord the King GLOUCESTER My Lord of Winchester I know your mind Tis not my speeches that you do mislike But tis my presence that doth trouble ye Rancour will out Proud prelate in thy face I see thy fury If I longer stay We shall begin our ancient bickerings Lordings farewell and say when I am gone I prophesied France will be lost ere long Exit CARDINAL So there goes our Protector in a rage Tis known to you he is mine enemy Nay more an enemy unto you all And no great friend I fear me to the King Consider lords he is the next of blood And heir apparent to the English crown Had Henry got an empire by his marriage And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west Theres reason he should be displeased at it Look to it lords Let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect What though the common people favour him Calling him Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice Jesu maintain your royal excellence With God preserve the good Duke Humphrey I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss He will be found a dangerous Protector BUCKINGHAM Why should he then protect our sovereign He being of age to govern of himself Cousin of Somerset join you with me And all together with the Duke of Suffolk Well quickly hoist Duke Humphrey from his seat CARDINAL This weighty business will not brook delay Ill to the Duke of Suffolk presently Exit SOMERSET Cousin"

acquainted with thee ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards JAQUES Why tis good to be sad and say nothing ROSALIND Why then tis good to be a post JAQUES I have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands JAQUES Yes I have gained my experience ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sadand to travel for it too Enter Orlando ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind JAQUES Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller Look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the

Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise ROSALIND Break an hours promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant him heartwhole ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snail ORLANDO Of a snail ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his heada better jointure I think than you make a woman Besides he brings his destiny with him ORLANDO Whats that ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife ORLANDO Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit

person I say I will not have you ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all ORLANDO And wilt thou have me ROSALIND Ay and twenty such ORLANDO What sayest thou ROSALIND Are you not good ORLANDO I hope so ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good thingCome sister you shall be the priest and marry usGive me your hand OrlandoWhat do you say sister ORLANDO Pray thee marry us CELIA I cannot say the words ROSALIND You must begin Will you Orlando CELIA Go toWill you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind ORLANDO I will ROSALIND Ay but when ORLANDO Why now as fast as she can marry us ROSAL"

extremes beyond extremity To make him curse this cursed crimeful night Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright And the dire thought of his committed evil Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans Let there bechance him pitiful mischances To make him moan but pity not his moans Stone him with hardned

own shadow let the thief run mad Himself himself seek every hour to kill Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill For who so base would such an office have As slandrous deathsman to so base a slave The baser is he coming from a king To shame his hope with deeds degenerate The mightier man the mightier is the thing That makes him honoured or begets him hate For greatest scandal waits on greatest state The moon being clouded presently is missed But little stars may hide them when they list The crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire And unperceived fly with the filth away But if the like the snowwhite swan desire The stain upon his silver down will stay Poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day Gnats are unnoted wheresoeer they fly But eagles gazed upon with every eye Out idle words servants to shallow fools Unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators Busy yourselves in skillcontending schools Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters To trembling clients be you mediators For me I force not argument a straw Since that my case is past the help of law In vain I rail at Opportunity At Time at Tarquin and uncheerful night In vain I cavil with mine infamy In vain I spurn at my confirmed despite This helpless smoke of words doth me no right The remedy indeed to do me good Is to let forth my foul defiled blood Poor hand why quiverst thou at this decree Honour thyself to rid me of this shame For if I die my honour lives in thee But if I live thou livst in my defame Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame And wast afeared to scratch her wicked foe Kill both thyself and her for yielding so This said from her betumbled couch she starteth To find some desprate instrument of death But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth To make more vent for passage of her breath Which thronging through her lips so vanisheth As smoke from tna that in air consumes Or that which from discharged cannon fumes In vain quoth she I live and seek in vain Some happy mean to end a hapless life I feared by Tarquins falchion to be slain Yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife But when I feared I was a loyal wife So am I nowO no that cannot be Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me O that is gone for which I sought to live And therefore now I need not fear to die To clear this spot by death at least I give A badge of fame to slanders livery A dying life to living infamy Poor helpless help the treasure stoln away To burn the guiltless casket where it lay Well well dear Collatine thou shalt not know The stained taste of violated troth I will not wrong thy true affection so To flatter thee with an infringed oath This bastard graff shall never come to growth He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute That thou art doting father of his fruit Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thoughtNor laugh with his companions at thy state But thou shalt know thy intrest was not bought Basely with gold but stoln from forth thy gate For me I am the mistress of my fate And with my trespass never will dispense Till life to death acquit my forced offence I will not poison thee with my attaint Nor fold my fault in cleanlycoined excuses My sable ground of sin I will not paint To hide the truth of this false nights abuses My tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices As from a mountainspring that feeds a dale Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale By this lamenting Philomel had ended The welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow And solemn night with slow sad gait descended To ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see And therefore still in night would cloistered be Revealing day through every cranny spies And seems to point her out where she sits weeping To whom she sobbing speaks O eye of eyes Why pryst thou through my window Leave thy peeping Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light For day hath naught to do whats done by night Thus cavils she with everything she sees True grief is fond and testy as a child Who wayward once his mood with naught agrees Old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild Continuance tames the one the other wild Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still With too much labour drowns for want of skill So she deepdrenched in a sea of care Holds disputation with each thing she views And to herself all sorrow doth compare No object but her passions strength renews And as one shifts another straight ensues Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words Sometime tis mad and too much talk affords The little birds that tune their mornings joy Make her moans mad with their sweet melody For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy Sad souls are slain in merry company Grief best is pleased with griefs society True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed When with like semblance it is sympathized Tis double death to drown in ken of shore He ten times pines that pines beholding food To see the salve doth make the wound ache more Great grief grieves most at that would do it good Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood Who being stopped the bounding banks oerflows Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows You mocking birds quoth she your tunes entomb Within your hollowswelling feathered breasts And in my hearing be you mute and dumb My restless discord loves no stops nor rests A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears Come Philomel that singst of ravishment Make thy sad grove in my disheveled hair As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment So I at each sad strain will strain a tear And with deep groans the diapason bear For burdenwise Ill hum on Tarquin still While thou on Tereus descants better skill And whiles against a thorn thou bearst thy part To keep thy sharp woes waking wretched I To imitate thee well against my heart Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye Who if it wink shall thereon fall and die These means as frets upon an instrument Shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment And for poor bird thou singst not in the day As shaming any eye should thee behold Some dark deep desert seated from the way That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold Will we find out and there we will unfold To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds Since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze Wildly determining which way to fly Or one encompassed with a winding maze That cannot tread the way out readily So with herself is she in mutiny To live or die which of the twain were better When life is shamed and Death reproachs debtor To kill myself quoth she alack what were it But with my body my poor souls pollution They that lose half with greater patience bear it Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion That mother tries a merciless conclusion Who having two sweet babes when death takes one Will slay the other and be nurse to none My body or my soul which was the dearer When the one pure the other made divine Whose love of either to myself was nearer When both were kept for heaven and Collatine"

my loves desire do contradict For some hardfavoured groom of thine quoth he Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will Ill murder straight and then Ill slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsome act of lust and so did kill The lechers in their deed This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy With this I did begin to start and cry And then against my heart he sets his sword Swearing unless I took all patiently I should not live to speak another word So should my shame still rest upon record And never be forgot in mighty Rome The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom Mine enemy was strong my poor self weak And far the weaker with so strong a fear My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak No rightful plea might plead for justice there His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies O teach me how to make mine own excuse Or at the least this refuge let me find Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse Immaculate and spotless is my mind That was not forced that never was inclined To accessary yieldings but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure Lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss With head declined and voice dammed up with woe With sad set eyes and wretched arms across From lips newwaxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so But wretched as he is he strives in vain What he breathes out his breath drinks up again As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast In rage sent out recalled in rage being past Even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw To push grief on and back the same grief draw Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh Dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth Another power no flood by raining slaketh My woe too sensible thy passion maketh More feelingpainful Let it then suffice To drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes And for my sake when I might charm thee so For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me Be suddenly revenged on my foe Thine mine his own Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late yet let the traitor die For sparing justice feeds iniquity But ere I name him you fair lords quoth she Speaking to those that came with Collatine Shall plight your honourable faiths to me With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine For tis a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms Knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms At this request with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid As bound in knighthood to her imposition Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed But she that yet her sad task hath not said The protestation stops O speak quoth she How may this forced stain be wiped from me What is the quality of my offence Being constrained with dreadful circumstance May my pure mind with the foul act dispense My lowdeclined honour to advance May any terms acquit me from this chance The poisoned fountain clears itself again And why not I from this compelled stain With this they all at once began to say Her bodys stain her mind untainted clears While with a joyless smile she turns away The face that map which deep impression bears Of hard misfortune carved in it with tears No no quoth she no dame hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuses giving Here with a sigh as if her heart would break She throws forth Tarquins name He he she says But more than he her poor tongue could not speak Till after many accents and delays Untimely breathings sick and short assays She utters this He he fair lords tis he That guides this hand to give this wound to me Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast A harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed That blow did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted prison where it breathed Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed Her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly Lifes lasting date from cancelled destiny Stonestill astonished with this deadly deed Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew Till Lucrece father that beholds her bleed Himself on her selfslaughtered body threw And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murdrous knife and as it left the place Her blood in poor revenge held it in chase And bubbling from her breast it doth divide In two slow rivers that the crimson blood Circles her body in on every side Who like a latesacked island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood Some of her blood still pure and red remained And some looked black and that false Tarquin stained About the mourning and congealed face Of that black blood a watry rigol goes Which seems to weep upon the tainted place And ever since as pitying Lucrece woes Corrupted blood some watery token shows And blood untainted still doth red abide Blushing at that which is so putrified Daughter dear daughter old Lucretius cries That life was mine which thou hast here deprived If in the child the fathers image lies Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived Thou wast not to this end from me derived If children predecease progenitors We are their offspring and they none of ours Poor broken glass I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born But now that fair fresh mirror dim and old Shows me a bareboned death by time outworn O from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn And shivered all the beauty of my glass That I no more can see what once I was O time cease thou thy course and last no longer If they surcease to be that should survive Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger And leave the faltring feeble souls alive The old bees die the young possess their hive Then live sweet Lucrece live again and see Thy father die and not thy father thee By this starts Collatine as from a dream And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place And then in keycold Lucrece bleeding stream He falls and bathes the pale fear in his face And counterfeits to die with her a space Till manly shame bids him possess his breath And live to be revenged on her death The deep vexation of his inward soul Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue Who mad that sorrow should his use control Or keep him from hearteasing words so long Begins to talk but through his lips do throng Weak words so thick come in his poor hearts aid That no man could distinguish what he said Yet sometime Tarquin was pronounced plain But through his teeth as if the name he toreThis windy tempest till it blow up rain Held back his sorrows tide to make it more At last it rains and busy winds give oer Then son and father weep with equal strife Who should weep most for daughter or for wife The one doth call her his the other his Yet neither may possess the claim they lay The father says Shes mine O mine she is Replies her husband Do not take away My sorrows interest let no mourner say He weeps for her for she was only mine And only must be wailed by Collatine O quoth Lucretius I did give that life Which she too early and too late hath spilled Woe woe quoth Collatine she was my wife I owed her and tis mine that she hath killed My daughter and my wife with clamours filled The dispersed air who holding Lucrece life Answered their cries my daughter and my wife Brutus who plucked the knife from Lucrece side Seeing such emulation in their woe Began to clothe his wit in state and pride Burying in Lucrece wound his follys show He with the Romans was esteemed so As silly jeering idiots are with kings For sportive words and uttring foolish things But now he throws that shallow habit by Wherein deep policy did him disguise And armed his longhid wits advisedly To check the tears in Collatinus eyes Thou wronged lord of Rome quoth he arise Let my unsounded self supposed a fool Now set thy longexperienced wit to school Why Collatine is woe the cure for woe Do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds Is it revenge to give thyself a blow For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so To slay herself that should have slain her foe Courageous Roman do not steep thy heart In such relenting dew of lamentations But kneel with me and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with invocations That they will suffer these abominations Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased Now by the Capitol that we adore And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained By heavens fair sun that breeds the fat earths store By all our country rights in Rome maintained And by chaste Lucrece soul that late complained Her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife We will revenge the death of this true wife This said he struck his hand upon his breast And kissed the fatal knife to end his vow And to his protestation urged the rest Who wondring at him did his words allow Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow And that deep vow which Brutus made before He doth again repeat and that they swore When they had sworn to this advised doom They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence To"

Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building

whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon

guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I

predestinate scratched face BEATRICE Scratching could not make it worse and twere such a face as yours were BENEDICK Well you are a rare parrotteacher BEATRICE A bird of my tongue is better than a

together Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio CLAUDIO Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato BENEDICK I noted her not but I looked on her CLAUDIO Is she not a modest young lady BENEDICK Do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex CLAUDIO No I pray thee speak in sober judgment BENEDICK Why i faith methinks shes too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like her CLAUDIO Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her BENEDICK Would you buy her that you enquire after her CLAUDIO Can the world buy such a jewel BENEDICK Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a good harefinder and Vulcan a rare carpenter Come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song CLAUDIO In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on BENEDICK I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter theres her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December But I hope you have no intent to turn husband have you CLAUDIO I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn to the contrary if Hero would be my wife BENEDICK Ist come to this in faith Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again Go to i faith and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays Reenter Don Pedro Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you DON PEDRO What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonatos BENEDICK I would your Grace would constrain me to tell DON PEDRO I charge thee on thy allegiance BENEDICK You hear Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love With who now that is your Graces part Mark how short his answer is with Hero Leonatos short daughter CLAUDIO If this were so so were it uttered BENEDICK Like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed God forbid it should be so CLAUDIO If my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be otherwise DON PEDRO Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy CLAUDIO You speak this to fetch me in my lord DON PEDRO By my troth I speak my thought CLAUDIO And in faith my lord I spoke mine BENEDICK And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine CLAUDIO That I love her I feel DON PEDRO That she is worthy I know BENEDICK That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake DON PEDRO Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty CLAUDIO And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will BENEDICK That a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me up I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the right to trust none and the fine isfor the which I may go the finerI will live a bachelor DON PEDRO I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love BENEDICK With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a balladmakers pen and hang me up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of blind Cupid DON PEDRO Well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument BENEDICK If"

streets of Rome And when you saw his chariot but appear Have you not made an universal shout That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores And do you now put on your best attire And do you now cull out a holiday And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompeys blood Be gone Run to your houses fall upon your knees Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude FLAVIUS Go go good countrymen and for this fault Assemble all the poor men of your sort Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all Exeunt Citizens See whether their basest metal be not movd They vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness Go you down that way towards the Capitol This way will I Disrobe the images If you do find them deckd with ceremonies MARULLUS May we do so You know it is the feast of Lupercal FLAVIUS It is no matter let no images Be hung with Caesars trophies Ill about And drive away the vulgar from the streets So do you too where you perceive them thick These growing feathers pluckd from Caesars wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness Exeunt SCENE II The same A public place Enter in procession with music Caesar Antony for the course Calphurnia Portia Decius Cicero Brutus Cassius and Casca a great crowd following among them a Soothsayer CAESAR Calphurnia CASCA Peace ho Caesar speaks Music ceases CAESAR Calphurnia CALPHURNIA Here my lord CAESAR Stand you directly in Antonius way When he doth run his course Antonius ANTONY Caesar my lord CAESAR Forget not in your speed Antonius To touch Calphurnia for our elders say The barren touched in this holy chase Shake off their sterile curse ANTONY I shall remember When Caesar says Do this it is performd CAESAR Set on and leave no ceremony out Music SOOTHSAYER Caesar CAESAR Ha Who calls CASCA Bid every noise be still peace yet again Music ceases CAESAR Who is it in the press that calls on me I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turnd to hear SOOTHSAYER Beware the Ides of March CAESAR What man is that BRUTUS A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March CAESAR Set him before me let me see his face CASSIUS Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar CAESAR What sayst thou to me now Speak once again SOOTHSAYER Beware the Ides of March CAESAR He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass Sennet Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius CASSIUS Will you go see the order of the course BRUTUS Not I CASSIUS I pray you do BRUTUS I am not gamesome I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony Let me not hinder Cassius your desires Ill leave you CASSIUS Brutus I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you BRUTUS Cassius Be not deceived if I have veild my look I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference Conceptions only proper to myself Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors But let not therefore my good friends be grieved Among which number Cassius be you one Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other men CASSIUS Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations Tell me good Brutus can you see your faceBRUTUS No Cassius for the eye sees not itself But by reflection by some other thing CASSIUS Tis just And it is very much lamented Brutus That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this ages yoke Have wishd that noble Brutus had his eyes BRUTUS Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me CASSIUS Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus Were I a common laugher or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout then hold me dangerous Flourish and shout BRUTUS What means this shouting I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king CASSIUS Ay do you fear it Then must I think you would not have it so BRUTUS I would not Cassius yet I love him well But wherefore do you hold me here so long What is it that you would impart to me If it be aught toward the general good Set honour in one eye and death i the other And I will look on both indifferently For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honour more than I fear death CASSIUS I know that virtue to be in you Brutus As well as I do know your outward favour Well honour is the subject of my story I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life but for my single self I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself I was born free as Caesar so were you We both have fed as well and we can both Endure the winters cold as well as he For once upon a raw and gusty day The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores Caesar said to me Darst thou Cassius now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point Upon the word Accoutred as I was I plunged in And bade him follow so indeed he did The torrent roard and we did buffet it With lusty sinews throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy But ere we could arrive the point proposd Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink I as Aeneas our great ancestor Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar And this man Is now become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake tis true this god did shake His coward lips did from their colour fly And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his lustre I did hear him groan Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius As a sick girl Ye gods it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone Shout Flourish BRUTUS Another general shout I do believe that these applauses are For some new honours that are heapd on Caesar CASSIUS Why man he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonourable graves Men at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars But in ourselves that we are underlings Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar Why should that name be sounded more than yours Write them together yours is as fair a name Sound them it doth become the mouth as well Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar Now in the names of all the gods at once Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great Age thou art shamd Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famd with more than with one man When could they say till now that talkd of Rome That her wide walls encompassd but one man Now is it Rome indeed and room enough When there is in it but one only man O you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brookd Th eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king BRUTUS That you do love me I am nothing jealous What you would work me to I have some aim How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter For this present I would not so with love I might entreat you Be any further movd What you have said I will consider what you have to say I will with patience hear and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things Till then my noble friend chew upon this Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us"

beyond my depth My highblown pride At length broke under me and now has left me Weary and old with service to the mercy Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye I feel my heart new opened O how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes favours There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin More pangs and fears than wars or women have And when he falls he falls like Lucifer Never to hope again Enter Cromwell standing amazed Why how now Cromwell CROMWELL I have no power to speak sir WOLSEY What amazed At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline Nay an you weep I am fallen indeed CROMWELL How does your Grace WOLSEY Why well Never so truly happy my good Cromwell I know myself now and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities A still and quiet conscience The King has cured me I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders These ruined pillars out of pity taken A load would sink a navy too much honour O tis a burden Cromwell tis a burden Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven CROMWELL I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it WOLSEY I hope I have I am able now methinks Out of a fortitude of soul I feel To endure more miseries and greater far Than my weakhearted enemies dare offer What news abroad CROMWELL The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the King WOLSEY God bless him CROMWELL The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord Chancellor in your place WOLSEY Thats somewhat sudden But hes a learned man May he continue Long in his Highness favour and do justice For truths sake and his conscience that his bones When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings May have a tomb of orphans tears wept on him What more CROMWELL That Cranmer is returned with welcome Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury WOLSEY Thats news indeed CROMWELL Last that the Lady Anne Whom the King hath in secrecy long married This day was viewed in open as his Queen Going to chapel and the voice is now Only about her coronation WOLSEY There was the weight that pulled me down O Cromwell The King has gone beyond me All my glories In that one woman I have lost for ever No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours Or gild again the noble troops that waited Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell I am a poor fallen man unworthy now To be thy lord and master Seek the King That sun I pray may never set I have told him What and how true thou art He will advance thee Some little memory of me will stir him I know his noble naturenot to let Thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell Neglect him not make use now and provide For thine own future safety CROMWELL O my lord Must I then leave you Must I needs forgo So good so noble and so true a master Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord The King shall have my service but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours WOLSEY Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries but thou hast forced me Out of thy honest truth to play the woman Lets dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell And when I am forgotten as I shall be And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in A sure and safe one though thy master missed it Mark but my fall and that that ruined me Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition By that sin fell the angels how can man then The image of his maker hope to win by it Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee Corruption wins not more than honesty Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not Let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys Thy Gods and truths Then if thou fallst O Cromwell Thou fallst a blessed martyr Serve the King And prithee lead me in There take an inventory of all I have To the last penny tis the Kings My robe And my integrity to heaven is all I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king He would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies CROMWELL Good sir have patience WOLSEY So I have Farewell The hopes of court My hopes in heaven do dwellExeunt ACT IV SCENE I A street in Westminster Enter two Gentlemen meeting one another FIRST GENTLEMAN Youre well met once again SECOND GENTLEMAN So are you FIRST GENTLEMAN You come to

This cannot be By no assay of reason Tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dressd in If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskilful To leave that latest which concerns him first Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless DUKE Nay in all confidence hes not for

and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter BRABANTIO A maiden never bold Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushd at herself and she in spite of nature Of years of country credit everything To fall in love with what she feard to look on It is judgement maimd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful oer the blood Or with some dram conjurd to this effect He wrought upon her DUKE To vouch this is no proof Without more wider and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him FIRST SENATOR But Othello speak Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maids affections Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth OTHELLO I do beseech you Send for the lady to the

flood and field Of hairbreadth scapes i th imminent deadly breach Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery of my redemption thence And portance in my travelers history Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speaksuch was the process And of the Cannibals that each other eat The Anthropophagi and men whose heads

cousin cousin PRINCE Benvolio who began this bloody fray BENVOLIO Tybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did slay Romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink How nice the quarrel was and urgd withal Your high displeasure All this uttered With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast Who all as hot turns deadly point to point And with a martial scorn with one hand beats Cold death aside and with the other sends It back to Tybalt whose dexterity Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud Hold friends Friends part and swifter than his tongue His agile arm beats down their fatal points And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled But by and by comes back to Romeo Who had but newly entertaind revenge And tot they go like lightning for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly This is the truth or let Benvolio die LADY CAPULET He is a kinsman to the Montague Affection makes him false he speaks not true Some twenty of them fought in this black strife And all those twenty could but kill one life I beg for justice which thou Prince must give Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live PRINCE Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe MONTAGUE Not Romeo Prince he was Mercutios friend His fault concludes but what the law should end The life of Tybalt PRINCE And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence I have an interest in your hates proceeding My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine I will be deaf to pleading and excuses Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses Therefore use none Let Romeo"

due Neer speak or think That Timons fortunes mong his friends can sink Exit FLAVIUS I would I could not think it That thought is bountys foe Being free itself it thinks all others so Exit ACT IIISCENE

Enter Lucullus SERVANT Heres my lord LUCULLUS Aside One of Lord Timons men A gift I warrant Why this hits right I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer tonightFlaminius honest Flaminius you are very respectively welcome sir Fill me some wine Exit Servant And how does that honourable complete freehearted gentleman of Athens thy very bountiful good lord and master FLAMINIUS His health is well sir LUCULLUS I am right glad that his health is well sir And what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty Flaminius FLAMINIUS Faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lords behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein LUCULLUS La la la la Nothing doubting says he Alas good lord A noble gentleman tis if he would not keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha dined with him and told him ont and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming Every man has his fault and honesty is his I ha told him ont but I could neer get him from t Enter Servant with wine SERVANT Please your lordship here is the wine LUCULLUS Flaminius I have noted thee always wise Heres to thee FLAMINIUS Your lordship speaks your pleasure LUCULLUS I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and canst use the time well if the time use thee well Good parts in thee To Servant Get you gone sirrah Exit Servant Draw nearer honest Flaminius Thy lords a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou knowst well enough although thou comst to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare friendship without security Heres three solidares for thee Good boy wink at me and say thou sawst me not Fare thee well FLAMINIUS Ist possible the world should so much differ And we alive that lived Fly damned baseness To him that worships thee Throws the money back LUCULLUS Ha Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master Exit FLAMINIUS May these add to the number that may scald thee Let molten coin be thy damnation Thou disease of a friend and not himself Has friendship such a faint and milky heart It turns in less than two nights O you gods I feel my masters passion This slave Unto his honour has my lords meat in him Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment When he is turned to poison O may diseases only work upont And when hes sick to death let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for be of any power To expel sickness but prolong his hour Exit SCENE II A public place Enter Lucius with three Strangers LUCIUS Who the Lord Timon He is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman FIRST STRANGER We know him for no less though we are but strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him LUCIUS Fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money SECOND STRANGER But believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely fort and showed what necessity belonged tot and yet was denied LUCIUS How SECOND STRANGER I tell you denied my lord LUCIUS What a strange case was that Now before the gods I am ashamed ont Denied that honourable man There was very little honour showed int For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should neer have denied his occasion so many talents Enter Servilius SERVILIUS See by good hap yonders my lord I have sweat to see his honour To Lucius My honoured lord LUCIUS Servilius You are kindly met sir Fare thee well Commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend SERVILIUS May it please your honour my lord hath sent LUCIUS Ha What has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord hes ever sending How shall I thank him thinkest thou And what has he sent now SERVILIUS Has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents LUCIUS I know his lordship is but merry with me He cannot want fiftyfive hundred talents SERVILIUS But in the meantime he wants less my lord If his occasion were not virtuous I should not urge it half so faithfully LUCIUS Dost thou speak seriously Servilius SERVILIUS Upon my soul tis true sir LUCIUS What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha shown myself honourable How unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to dothe more beast I sayI was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him SERVILIUS Yes sir I shall LUCIUS Ill look you out a good turn Servilius Exit Servilius True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed And he thats once denied will hardly speed Exit FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this Hostilius SECOND STRANGER Ay too well FIRST STRANGER Why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece Is every flatterers spirit Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish For in my knowing Timon has been this lords father And kept his credit with his purse Supported his estate nay Timons money Has paid his men their wages He neer drinks But Timons silver treads upon his lip And yetO see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape He does deny him in respect of his What charitable men afford to beggars THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it FIRST STRANGER For mine own part I never tasted Timon in my life Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend Yet I protest For his right noble mind illustrious virtue And honourable carriage Had his necessity made use of me I would have put my wealth into donation And the best half should have returned to him So much I love his heart But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense For policy sits above conscience Exeunt SCENE III The same A room in Sempronius house Enter a Third Servant of Timons with Sempronius another of Timons friends SEMPRONIUS Must he needs trouble me int Hum Bove all others He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus And now Ventidius is wealthy too Whom he redeemed from prison All these Owe their estates unto him SERVANT My lord They have all been touched and found base metal For they have all denied him SEMPRONIUS How Have they denied him Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me Three Humh It shows but little love or judgment in him Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians Thrive give him over Must I take th cure upon me Has much disgraced me int Im angry at him That might have known my place I see no sense fort But his occasions might have wooed me first For in my conscience I was the first man That eer received gift from him And does he think so backwardly of me now That Ill requite it last No So it may prove an argument of laughter To th rest and I mongst lords be thought a fool Id rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first but for my minds sake Id such a courage to do him good But now return And with their faint reply this answer join Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin Exit SERVANT Excellent Your lordships a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself byt and I cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his politic love This was my lords best hope now all are"

creatures want our hands And cannot passionate our tenfold grief With folded arms This poor right hand of mine Is left to tyrannize upon my breast Who when my heart all mad with misery Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh Then thus I thump it down Thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still Wound

O handle not the theme to talk of hands Lest we remember still that we have none Fie fie how frantically I square my talk As if we should forget we had no hands If Marcus did not name the word of hands Come lets fall to and gentle girl eat this Here is no drink Hark Marcus what she says I can interpret all her martyred signs She says she drinks no other drink but tears Brewed with her sorrow meshed upon her cheeks Speechless complainer I will learn thy thought In thy dumb action will I be as perfect As begging hermits in their holy prayers Thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven

merry and thou hast killed him MARCUS Pardon me sir twas a black illfavoured fly Like to the empress Moor therefore I killed him TITUS O O O Then pardon me for reprehending thee For thou hast done a charitable deed Give me thy knife I will insult on him Flattering myself as if it were the Moor Come hither purposely to poison me Theres for thyself and thats for Tamora Ah sirrah Yet I think we are

it or came by it What stuff tis made of whereof it is born I am to learn And such a wantwit sadness makes of me That I have much ado to know myself SALARINO Your mind is tossing on the ocean There where your argosies with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood Or as it were the pageants of the sea Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them do them reverence As they fly by them with their woven wings SOLANIO Believe me sir had I such venture forth The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad SALARINO My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea I should not see the sandy hourglass run But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew dockd in sand Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks Which touching but my gentle vessels side Would scatter all her spices on the stream Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks And in a word but even now worth this And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought To think on this and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechancd would make me sad But tell not me I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise ANTONIO Believe me no I thank my fortune for it My ventures are not in one bottom trusted Nor to one place nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad SALARINO Why then you are in love ANTONIO Fie fie SALARINO Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry and twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad Now by twoheaded

teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable Enter Bassanio Lorenzo and Gratiano SOLANIO Here comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman Gratiano and Lorenzo Fare ye well We leave you

ANTONIO I hold the world but as the world Gratiano A stage where every man must play a part And mine a sad one GRATIANO Let me play the fool With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster Sleep when he wakes And creep into the jaundice By being peevish I tell thee what Antonio I love thee and tis my love that speaks There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond And do a wilful stillness entertain With purpose to be dressd in an opinion Of wisdom gravity profound conceit As who should say I am Sir Oracle And when I ope my lips let no dog bark O my Antonio I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing when I am very sure If they should speak would almost damn those ears Which hearing them would call their brothers fools Ill tell thee more of this another time But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon this opinion Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well a while Ill end my exhortation after dinner LORENZO Well we will leave you then till dinnertime I must be one of these same dumb wise men For Gratiano never lets me speak GRATIANO Well keep me company but two years moe Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue ANTONIO Fare you well Ill grow a talker for this gear GRATIANO Thanks i faith for silence is only commendable In a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo ANTONIO Is that anything now BASSANIO Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search ANTONIO Well tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you today promisd to tell me of BASSANIO Tis not unknown to you Antonio How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance Nor do I now make moan to be abridgd From such a noble rate but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gagd To you Antonio I owe the most in money and in love And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe ANTONIO I pray you good Bassanio let me know it And if it stand as you yourself still do Within the eye of honour be assurd My purse my person my extremest means Lie all unlockd to your occasions BASSANIO In my schooldays when I had lost one shaft I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way

Collatine Let my good name that senseless reputation For Collatines dear love be kept unspotted If that be made a theme for disputation The branches of another root are rotted And undeserved reproach to him allotted That is as clear from this attaint of mine As I ere this was pure to Collatine O unseen shame invisible disgrace O unfelt sore crestwounding private scar Reproach is stamped in Collatinus face And Tarquins eye may read the mot afar How he in peace is wounded not in war Alas how many bear such shameful blows Which not themselves but he that gives them knows If Collatine thine honour lay in me From me by strong assault it is bereft My honey lost and I a dronelike bee Have no perfection of my summer left But robbed and ransacked by injurious theft In thy weak hive a wandring wasp hath crept And sucked the honey which thy chaste bee kept Yet am I guilty of thy honours wrack Yet for thy honour did I entertain him Coming from thee I could not put him back For it had been dishonour to disdain him Besides of weariness he did complain him And talked of virtue O unlookedfor evil When virtue is profaned in such a devil Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts Or kings be breakers of their own behests But no perfection is so absolute That some impurity doth not pollute The aged man that coffers up his gold Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold But like stillpining Tantalus he sits And useless barns the harvest of his wits Having no other pleasure of his gain But torment that it cannot cure his pain So then he hath it when he cannot use it And leaves it to be mastered by his young Who in their pride do presently abuse it Their father was too weak and they too strong To hold their cursedblessed fortune long The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours Even in the moment that we call them ours Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing What virtue breeds iniquity devours We have no good

Thou makst the vestal violate her oath Thou blowst the fire when temperance is thawed Thou smotherst honesty thou murderst troth Thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd Thou plantest scandal and

suppliants friend And bring him where his suit may be obtained When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chained Give physic to the sick ease to the pained The poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee But they neer meet with Opportunity The patient dies while the physician sleeps The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds Justice is feasting while the widow weeps Advice is sporting while infection breeds Thou grantst no time for charitable deeds Wrath envy treason rape and murders rages Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages When

To stamp the seal of time in aged things To wake the morn and sentinel the night To wrong the wronger till he render right To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours And smear with dust their glittring golden towers To fill with wormholes stately monuments To feed oblivion with decay of things To blot old books and alter their contents To pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings To dry the old oaks sap and cherish springs To spoil antiquities of hammered steel And turn the giddy round of Fortunes wheel To show the beldam daughters of her daughter To make the child a man the man a child To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter To tame the unicorn and lion wild To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops And waste huge stones with little waterdrops Why workst thou mischief in thy pilgrimage Unless thou couldst return to make amends One poor retiring minute in an age Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends O this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight Devise extremes beyond extremity To make him curse this cursed crimeful night Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright And the dire thought of his committed evil Shape every bush a hideous shapeless

hearts harder than stones And let mild women to him lose their mildness Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness Let him have time to tear his curled hair Let him have time against himself to rave Let him have time of Times help to despair Let him have time to live a loathed slave Let him have time a beggars orts to crave And time to see one that by alms doth live Disdain to him disdained scraps to give Let him have time to see his friends his foes And merry fools to mock at him resort Let him have time to mark how slow time goes In time of sorrow and how swift and short His time of folly and his time of sport And ever let his unrecalling crime Have time to wail th abusing of his time O Time thou tutor both to good and bad Teach me to curse him that thou taughtst this ill At his own shadow let the thief run mad Himself himself seek every hour to kill Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill For who so base would such an office have As slandrous deathsman to so base a slave The baser is he coming from a king To shame his hope with deeds degenerate The mightier man the mightier is the thing That makes him honoured or begets him hate For greatest scandal waits on greatest state The moon being clouded presently is missed But little stars may hide them when they list The crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire And unperceived fly with the filth away But if the like the snowwhite swan desire The stain upon his silver down will stay Poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day Gnats are unnoted wheresoeer they fly But eagles gazed upon with every eye Out idle words servants to shallow fools Unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators Busy yourselves in skillcontending schools Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters To trembling clients be you mediators For me I force not argument a straw Since that my case is past the help of law In vain I rail at Opportunity At Time at Tarquin and uncheerful night In vain I cavil with mine infamy In vain I spurn at my confirmed despite This helpless smoke of words doth me no right The remedy indeed to do me good Is to let forth my foul defiled blood Poor hand why quiverst thou at this decree Honour thyself to rid me of this shame For if I die my honour lives in thee But if I live thou livst in my defame Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame And wast afeared to scratch her wicked foe

simpleness DUKE What would you Desdemona DESDEMONA That I did love the Moor to live with him My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world my hearts subdued Even to the very quality of my lord I saw Othellos visage in his mind And to his honours and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate So that dear lords if I be left behind A moth of peace and he go to the war The rites for which I love him are bereft me And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence Let me go with him OTHELLO Let her have your voice Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it

Senators Officers c OTHELLO My life upon her faith Honest Iago My Desdemona must I leave to thee I prithee let thy wife attend on her And bring them after in the best advantage Come Desdemona I have but an hour Of love of worldly matters and directionTo spend with thee We must obey the time Exeunt Othello and Desdemona RODERIGO Iago IAGO What sayst thou noble heart RODERIGO What will I do thinkest thou IAGO Why go to bed and sleep RODERIGO I will incontinently drown myself IAGO If thou dost I shall never love thee after Why thou silly gentleman RODERIGO It is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician IAGO O villainous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guineahen I would change my humanity with a baboon RODERIGO What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it IAGO Virtue a fig Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion RODERIGO It cannot be IAGO It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moorput money in thy pursenor he his to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in their wills Fill thy purse with money The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida She must change for youth When she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change she must Therefore put money in thy purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning Make all the money thou canst If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money A pox of drowning thyself It is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her RODERIGO Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue IAGO Thou art sure of me Go make money I have told thee often and I retell thee again and again I hate the Moor My cause is hearted thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will have more of this tomorrow Adieu RODERIGO Where shall we meet i the morning IAGO At my lodging RODERIGO Ill be with thee betimes IAGO Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo RODERIGO What say you IAGO No more of drowning do you hear RODERIGO I am changed Ill sell all my land Exit IAGO Thus do I ever make my fool my purse For I mine own gaind knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets He has done my office I know not if t be true But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety He holds me well The better shall my purpose work on him Cassios a proper man Let me see now To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery How how Lets see After some time to abuse Othellos ear That he is too familiar with his wife He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected framd to"

importune you To let him spend his time no more at home Which would be great impeachment to his age In having known no travel in his youth ANTONIO Nor needst thou much importune me to that Whereon

thinks The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence And open this to Pericles I do shame To think of what a noble strain you are And of how coward a spirit CLEON To such proceeding Whoever but his approbation added Though not his prime consent he did not flow From honourable courses DIONYZA Be it so then Yet none does know but you how she came dead Nor none can know Leonine being gone She did distain my child and stood between Her and her fortunes none would look on her But cast their gazes on Marinas face Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin Not worth the time of day It pierced me through And though you call my course unnatural You not your child well loving yet I find It greets me as an enterprise of kindness Performd to your sole daughter CLEON Heavens forgive it DIONYZA And

              "content": " and therefore to be won Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed And when a woman woos what womans son Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee Thine by thy beauty being false to me 42 That thou hast her it is not all my grief And yet it may be said I loved her dearly That she hath thee is of my wailing chief A loss in love that touches me more nearly Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her And for my sake even so doth she abuse me Suffring my friend for my sake to approve her If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain And losing her my friend hath found that loss Both find each other and I lose both twain And both for my sake lay on me this cross But heres the joy my friend and I are one Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone 43 When most I wink then do mine eyes best see For all the day they view things unrespected But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee And darkly bright are bright in dark directed Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadows form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so How would I say mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay All days are nights to see till I see thee And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 44 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought Injurious distance should not stop my way For then despite of space I would be brought From limits far remote where thou dost stay No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be But ah thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone But that so much of earth and water wrought I must attend times leisure with my moan Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears badges of eithers woe 45 The other two slight air and purging fire Are both with thee wherever I abide The first my thought the other my desire These presentabsent with swift motion slide For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee My life being made of four with two alone Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy Until lifes composition be recured By those swift messengers returned from thee Who even but now come back again assured Of thy fair health recounting it to me This told I joy but then no longer glad I send them back again and straight grow sad 46 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar My heart mine eye the freedom of that right My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie A closet never pierced with crystal eyes But the defendant doth that plea deny And says in him thy fair appearance lies To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart And by their verdict is determined The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part And my hearts right thy inward love of heart 47 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took And each doth good turns now unto the other When that mine eye is famished for a look Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother With my loves picture then my eye doth feast And to the painted banquet bids my heart Another time mine eye is my hearts guest And in his thoughts of love doth share a part So either by thy picture or my love Thyself away art present still with me For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move And I am still with them and they with thee Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight 48 How careful was I when I took my way Each trifle under truest bars to thrust That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust But thou to whom my jewels trifles are Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief Thou best of dearest and mine only care Art left the prey of every vulgar thief Thee have I not locked up in any chest Save where thou art not though I feel thou art Within the gentle closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 49 Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my defects When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws Since why to love I can allege no cause 50 How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary travels end Doth teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend The beast that bears me tired with my woe Plods dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide Which heavily he answers with a groan More sharp to me than spurring to his side For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind 51 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of perfectst love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went wilfulslow Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go 52 So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure The which he will not every hour survey For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like stones of worth they thinly placed are Or captain jewels in the carcanet So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hideTo make some special instant specialblest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope Being had to triumph being lacked to hope 53 What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe Adonis and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you On Helens cheek all art of beauty set And you in Grecian tires are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty doth appear And you in every blessed shape we know In all external grace you have some part But you like none none you for constant heart 54 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly When summers breath their masked buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made And so of you beauteous and lovely youth When that shall fade my verse distills your truth 55 Not marble nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time When wasteful war shall statues overturn And broils root out the work of masonry Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory Gainst death and alloblivious enmity Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom So till the judgement that yourself arise You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes 56 Sweet love renew thy force be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite Which but today by feeding is allayed Tomorrow sharpened in his former might So love be thou although today thou fill Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness Tomorrow see again and do not kill The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore where two contracted new Come daily to the banks that when they see Return of love more blest may be the view Or call it winter which being full of care Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare 57 Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend Nor services to do till you require"

drown myself for the love of a guineahen I would change my humanity with a baboon RODERIGO What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it IAGO Virtue a fig Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion RODERIGO It cannot be IAGO It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moorput money in thy pursenor he his to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in their wills Fill thy purse with money The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida She must change for youth When she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change she must Therefore put money in thy purse If thou wilt"
