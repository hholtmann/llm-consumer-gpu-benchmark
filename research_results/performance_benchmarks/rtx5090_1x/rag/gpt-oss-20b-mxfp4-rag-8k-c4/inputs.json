Chased us away till raising of more aid We came again to bind them Then they fled Into this abbey whither we pursued them And here the abbess shuts the gates on us And will not suffer us to fetch him

dankish vault at home There left me and my man both bound together Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder I gaind my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your Grace whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities ANGELO My lord in truth thus far I witness with him That he dind not at home but was lockd out DUKE But had he such a chain of thee or no ANGELO He had my lord and when he ran in here These people saw the chain about his neck MERCHANT Besides I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart And thereupon I drew my sword on you And then you fled into this abbey here From whence I think you are come by miracle ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never came within these abbey

as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia you cannot love her You tell her so Must she not then be answerd DUKE There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart no womans heart So big to hold so much they lack retention Alas their love may be called appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia VIOLA Ay but I know DUKE What dost thou know VIOLA Too well what love

our brazen tombs And then grace us in the disgrace of death When spite of cormorant devouring time Th endeavour of this present breath may buy That honour which shall bate his scythes keen edge And make us heirs of all eternity Therefore brave conquerors for so you are That war against your own affections And the huge army of the worlds desires Our late edict shall strongly stand in force Navarre shall be the wonder of the world Our court shall be a little academe Still and contemplative in living art You three Berowne Dumaine and Longaville Have sworn for three years term to live with me My fellowscholars and to keep those statutes That are recorded in this schedule here Your oaths are passed and now subscribe your namesThat his own hand may strike his honour down That violates the smallest branch herein If you are armed to do as sworn to do Subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too LONGAVILLE I am resolved Tis but a three years fast The mind shall banquet though the body pine Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits Make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits He signs DUMAINE My loving lord Dumaine is mortified The grosser manner of these worlds delights He throws upon the gross worlds baser slaves To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die With all these living in philosophy He signs BEROWNE I can but say their protestation over So much dear liege I have already sworn That is to live and study here three years But there are other strict observances As not to see a woman in that term Which I hope well is not enrolled there And one day in a week to touch no food And but one meal on every day beside The which I hope is not enrolled there And then to sleep but three hours in the night And not be seen to wink of all the day When I was wont to think no harm all night And make a dark night too of half the day Which I hope well is not enrolled there O these are barren tasks too hard to keep Not to see ladies study fast not sleep KING Your oath is passed to pass away from these BEROWNE Let me say no my liege an if you please I only swore to study with your Grace And stay here in your court for three years space LONGAVILLE You swore to that Berowne and to the rest BEROWNE By yea and nay sir then I swore in jest What is the end of study let me know KING Why that to know which else we should not know BEROWNE Things hid and barred you mean from common sense KING Ay that is studys godlike recompense BEROWNE Come on then I will swear to study so To know the thing I am forbid to know As thus to study where I well may dine When I to feast expressly am forbid Or study where to meet some mistress fine When mistresses from common sense are hid Or having sworn too hardakeeping oath Study to break it and not break my troth If studys gain be thus and this be so Study knows that which yet it doth not know Swear me to this and I will neer say no KING These be the stops that hinder study quite And train our intellects to vain delight BEROWNE Why all delights are vain but that most vain Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain As painfully to pore upon a book To seek the light of truth while truth the while Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look Light seeking light doth light of light beguile So ere you find where light in darkness lies Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes Study me how to please the eye indeed By fixing it upon a fairer eye Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed And give him light that it was blinded by Study is like the heavens glorious sun That will not be deepsearched with saucy looks Small have continual plodders ever won Save base authority from others books These earthly godfathers of heavens lights That give a name to every fixed star Have no more profit of their shining nights Than those that walk and wot not what they are Too much to know is to know naught but fame And every godfather can give a name KING How well hes read to reason against reading DUMAINE Proceeded well

proud summer boast Before the birds have any cause to sing Why should I joy in any abortive birth At Christmas I no more desire a rose Than wish a snow in Mays newfangled shows But like of each thing that in season grows So you to study now it is too late Climb oer the house to unlock the little gate KING Well sit you out Go home Berowne Adieu BEROWNE No my good lord I have sworn to stay with you And though I have for barbarism spoke more Than for that angel knowledge you can say Yet confident Ill keep what I have sworn And bide the penance of each three years day Give me the paper let me read the same And to the strictest decrees Ill write my name KING How well this yielding rescues thee from shame BEROWNE Reads Item That no woman shall come within a mile of my court Hath this been proclaimed LONGAVILLE Four days ago BEROWNE Lets see the penalty Reads On pain of losing her tongue Who devised this penalty LONGAVILLE Marry that did I BEROWNE Sweet lord and why LONGAVILLE To fright them hence with that dread penalty BEROWNE A dangerous law against gentility Reads Item If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise This article my liege yourself must break For well you know here comes in embassy The French Kings daughter with yourself to speak A mild of grace and complete majesty About surrender up of Aquitaine To her decrepit sick and bedrid father Therefore this article is made in vain Or vainly comes th admired Princess hither KING What say you lords Why this was quite forgot BEROWNE So study evermore is overshot While it doth study to have what it would It doth forget to do the thing it should And when it hath the thing it hunteth most Tis won as towns with fire so won so lost KING We must of force dispense with this decree She must lie here on mere necessity BEROWNE Necessity will make us all forsworn Three thousand times within this three years space For every man with his affects is born Not by might mastered but by special grace If I break faith this word shall speak for me I am forsworn on mere necessity So to the laws at large I write my name And he that breaks them in the least degree Stands in attainder of eternal shame Suggestions are to other as to me But I believe although I seem so loath I am the last that will last keep his oath He signs But is there no quick recreation granted KING Ay that there is Our court you know is haunted With a refined traveller of Spain A man in all the worlds new fashion planted That hath a mint of

that Armado hight For interim to our studies shall relate In highborn words the worth of many a knight From tawny Spain lost in the worlds debate How you delight my lords I know not I But I protest I

she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it PORTIA That scuse serves many men to save their gifts And if your wife be not a madwoman And know how well I have deservd this ring She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me Well peace be with you Exeunt Portia and Nerissa ANTONIO My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued

Shylocks house GRATIANO That will I do NERISSA Sir I would speak with you Aside to Portia Ill see if I can get my husbands ring Which I did make him swear to keep for ever PORTIA To Nerissa Thou mayst

show me to this house Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Belmont The avenue to Portias house Enter Lorenzo and Jessica LORENZO The moon shines bright In such a night as this When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighd his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night JESSICA In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully oertrip the dew And saw the lions shadow ere himself And ran dismayd away LORENZO In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild seabanks and waft her love To come again to Carthage JESSICA In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old son LORENZO In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont JESSICA In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well Stealing her soul with many vows of faith And neer a true one LORENZO In such a night Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew Slander her love and he forgave it her JESSICA I would outnight you did no body come But hark I hear the footing of a man Enter Stephano LORENZO Who comes so fast in silence of the night STEPHANO A friend LORENZO A friend What friend Your name I pray you friend STEPHANO Stephano is my name and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont She doth stray about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours LORENZO Who comes with her STEPHANO None but a holy hermit and her maid I pray you is my master yet returnd LORENZO He is

signify I pray you Within the house your mistress is at hand And bring your music forth into the air Exit StephanoHow sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold Theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst But in his motion like an angel sings Still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins Such harmony is in immortal souls But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it Enter Musicians Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear And draw her home with music Music JESSICA I am never merry when I hear sweet music LORENZO The reason is your spirits are attentive For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud Which is the hot condition of their blood If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound Or any air of music touch their ears You shall perceive them make a mutual stand Their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods Since naught so stockish hard and full of rage But music for the time doth change his nature The man that hath no music in himself Nor is not movd with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus Let no such man be trusted Mark the music Enter Portia and Nerissa PORTIA That light we see is burning in my hall How far that little candle throws his beams So shines a good deed in a naughty world NERISSA When the moon shone we did not see the candle PORTIA So doth the greater glory dim the less A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by and then his state Empties itself as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters Music hark NERISSA It is your music madam of the house PORTIA Nothing is good I see without respect Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day NERISSA Silence bestows that virtue on it madam PORTIA The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended and I think The nightingale if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling would be thought No better a musician than the wren How many things by season seasond are To their right praise and true perfection Peace How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awakd Music ceases LORENZO That is the voice Or I am much deceivd of Portia PORTIA He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo By the bad voice LORENZO Dear lady welcome home PORTIA We have been praying for our husbands welfare Which speed we hope the better for our words Are they returnd LORENZO Madam they are not yet But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming PORTIA Go in Nerissa Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you A tucket sounds LORENZO Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet We are no telltales madam fear you not PORTIA This night methinks is but the daylight sick It looks a little paler Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid Enter Bassanio Antonio Gratiano and their Followers BASSANIO We should hold day with the Antipodes If you would walk in absence of the sun PORTIA Let me give light but let me not be light For a light wife doth make a heavy husband And never be Bassanio so for me But God sort all You are welcome home my lord BASSANIO I thank you madam Give welcome to my friend This is the man this is Antonio To whom I am so infinitely bound PORTIA You should in all sense be much bound to him For as I hear he was much bound for you ANTONIO No more than I am well acquitted of PORTIA Sir you are very welcome to our house It must appear in other ways than words Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy GRATIANO To Nerissa By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong In faith I gave it to the judges clerk Would he were gelt that had it for my part Since you do take it love so much at heart PORTIA A quarrel ho already Whats the matter GRATIANO About a hoop of gold a paltry ring That she did give me whose posy was For all the world like cutlers poetry Upon a knife Love me and leave me not NERISSA What talk you of the posy or the value You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death And that it should lie with you in your grave Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths You should have been respective and have kept it Gave it a judges clerk No Gods my judge The clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had it GRATIANO He will and if he live to be a man NERISSA Ay if a woman live to be a man GRATIANO Now by this hand I gave it to a youth A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy No higher than thyself the judges clerk A prating boy that beggd it as a fee I could not for my heart deny it him PORTIA You were to blameI must be plain with you To part so slightly with your wifes first gift A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it and here he stands I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief An twere to me I should be mad at it BASSANIO Aside Why I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it GRATIANO My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that beggd it and indeed Deservd it too And then the boy his clerk That took some pains in writing he beggd mine And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings PORTIA What ring gave you my lord Not that I hope which you receivd of me BASSANIO If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it it is gone PORTIA Even so void is your false heart of truth By heaven I will neer come in your bed Until I see the ring NERISSA Nor I in yours Till I again see mine BASSANIO Sweet Portia If you did know to whom I gave the ring If you did know for whom I gave the ring And would conceive for what I gave the ring And how unwillingly I left the ring When nought would be accepted but the ring You would abate the strength of your displeasure PORTIA If you had known the virtue of the ring Or half her worthiness that gave the ring Or your own honour to contain the ring You would not then have parted with the ring What man is there so much unreasonable If you had pleasd to have defended it With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony Nerissa teaches me what to believe Ill die fort but some woman had the ring BASSANIO No by my honour madam by my soul No woman had it but a civil doctor Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And beggd the ring the which I did deny him And sufferd him to go displeasd away Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady I was enforcd to send it after him I was beset with shame and courtesy My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it Pardon me good lady For by these blessed candles of the night Had you been there I think you would have beggd The ring of me to give the worthy doctor PORTIA Let not that doctor eer come near my house Since he hath got the jewel that I loved And that which you did swear to keep for me I will become as liberal as you Ill not deny him anything I have No not my body nor my husbands bed Know him I shall I am well sure of it Lie not a night from home Watch me like Argus If you do not if I be left alone Now by mine honour which is yet mine own Ill have that doctor for mine bedfellow NERISSA And I his clerk Therefore be well advisd How you do leave me to mine own protection GRATIANO Well do you so Let not me take him then For if I do Ill mar the young clerks pen ANTONIO I am th unhappy subject of these quarrels PORTIA Sir grieve not you You are welcome notwithstanding BASSANIO Portia forgive me this enforced wrong And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself PORTIA Mark you but that In both my eyes he doubly sees himself In each eye one Swear by your double self And theres an oath of credit BASSANIO Nay but hear me Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee ANTONIO I once did lend my body for his wealth Which but for him that had your husbands ring Had quite miscarried I dare be bound again My soul upon the forfeit that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly PORTIA Then you shall be his surety Give him this And bid him keep it better than the other ANTONIO Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring BASSANIO By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor PORTIA I had it of him pardon me Bassanio For by this ring the doctor lay with me NERISSA And pardon me my gentle Gratiano For that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerk In lieu of this last night did lie with me GRATIANO Why this is like the mending of highways In summer where the ways are fair enough What are we cuckolds ere we have deservd it PORTIA Speak not so grossly You are all amazd Here is a letter read it at your leisure It comes from Padua from Bellario There you shall find that Portia was the doctor Nerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you And even but now returnd I have not yet Enterd my house Antonio you are welcome And I have better news in store for you Than you expect unseal this letter soon There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter ANTONIO I am dumb BASSANIO Were you the doctor and I knew you not GRATIANO Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold NERISSA Ay but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man BASSANIO Sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow When I am absent then lie with my wife ANTONIO Sweet lady you have given me life and living For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road PORTIA How now Lorenzo My clerk hath some good comforts too for you NERISSA Ay and Ill give them him without a fee There do I give to you and Jessica From the rich Jew a special deed of giftAfter his death of all he dies possessd of LORENZO Fair ladies you drop manna in the way Of starved people PORTIA It is almost morning And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full Let us go in And charge us there upon intergatories And we will answer all things faithfully GRATIANO Let it be so The first intergatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay Or go to bed now being two hours to day But were the day come I should wish it dark Till I were couching with the doctors clerk Well while I live Ill fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissas ring Exeunt THE MERRY WIVES OF

his fleece And next his throat unto the butchers knife What scene of death hath Roscius now to act RICHARD Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind The thief doth fear each bush an officer KING HENRY The bird that hath been limed in a bush With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush And I the hapless male to one sweet bird Have now the fatal object in my eye Where my poor young was limed was caught and killed RICHARD Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete That taught his son the office of a fowl And yet for all his wings the fool was drowned KING HENRY I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus Thy father Minos that denied our course The sun that seared the wings of my sweet boy Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words My breast can better brook thy daggers point Than can my ears that tragic history But wherefore dost thou come Is t for my life RICHARD Thinkst thou I am an executioner KING HENRY A persecutor I am sure thou art If murdering innocents be executing Why then thou art an executioner RICHARD Thy son I killed for his presumption KING HENRY Hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume Thou

Men for their sons wives for their husbands Orphans for their parents timeless death Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born The owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign The nightcrow cried aboding luckless time Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees The raven rooked her on the chimneys top And chattring pies in dismal discord sung Thy mother felt more than a mothers pain And yet brought forth less than a mothers hope To wit an indigested and deformed lump Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born To signify thou camst to bite the world And if the rest be true which I have heard Thou camst RICHARD Ill hear no more Die prophet in thy speech Stabs him For this amongst the rest was I ordained KING HENRY Ay and for much more slaughter after this O God forgive my sins and pardon thee Dies RICHARD What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted See how my sword weeps for the poor Kings death O may such purple tears be always shed From those that wish the downfall of our house If any spark of life be yet remaining Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither Stabs him again I that have neither pity love nor fear Indeed tis true that Henry told me of For I have often heard my mother say I came into the world with my legs forward Had I not reason think ye to make haste And seek their ruin that usurped our right The midwife wondered and the women cried O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth And so I was which plainly signified That I should snarl and bite and play the dog Then since the heavens have shaped my body so Let hell make crooked my mind to answer it I have no brother I am like no brother And this word love which greybeards call divine Be resident in men like one another And not in me I am myself alone Clarence beware thou keepst me from the light But I will sort a pitchy day for thee For I will buzz abroad such prophecies That Edward shall be fearful of his life And then to purge his fear Ill be thy death King Henry and the Prince his son are gone Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest Counting myself but bad till I be best Ill throw thy body

thou mightst repossess the crown in peace And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain RICHARD Aside Ill blast his harvest if your head were laid For yet I am not looked on in the world This shoulder

made your master in this place PAGE He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave And bid me stand aloof and so I did Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb And by and by my master drew on him And then I ran away to call the watch PRINCE This letter doth make good the Friars words Their course of love the tidings of her death And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor pothecary and therewithal Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet Where be these enemies Capulet Montague See what a scourge is laid upon your hate That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love And I for winking at your discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen All are punishd CAPULET O brother Montague give me thy hand This is my daughters jointure for no more Can I demand MONTAGUE But I can give thee more For I will raise her statue in pure gold That whiles Verona by that name is known There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet CAPULET As rich shall Romeos by his ladys lie Poor sacrifices of our enmity PRINCE A glooming peace this morning with it brings The sun for sorrow will not show his head Go hence to have more talk of these sad things Some shall

in such contempt My lords you know as know the mightful gods However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the peoples ears there naught hath passed But even with law against the wilful sons Of old Andronicus And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks His fits his frenzy and his bitterness And now he writes to heaven for his redress See heres to Jove and this to Mercury This to Apollo this to the god of war Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome Whats this but libelling against the senate And blazoning our injustice everywhere A goodly humour is it not my lords As who would say in Rome no justice were But if I live his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus health whom if she sleep Hell so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proudst conspirator that lives TAMORA My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine Lord of my life commander of my thoughts Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus age Th effects of sorrow for his valiant sons Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts Aside Why thus it shall become Highwitted Tamora to gloze with all But Titus I have touched thee to the quick Thy lifeblood out if Aaron now be wise Then is all safe the anchor in the port Enter Clown How now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us CLOWN Yes forsooth an your mistresship be emperial TAMORA Empress I am but yonder sits the emperor CLOWN Tis he

Rome and me Enter Aemilius What news with thee Aemilius AEMILIUS Arm my lord Rome never had more cause The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of highresolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus did SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor I will enchant the old AndronicusWith words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep Whenas the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feed SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us TAMORA If Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue to Aemilius Go thou before be our ambassador Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him best AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually Exit TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devices SATURNINUS Then go successantly and plead to him Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Plains near Rome Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with drums and soldiers LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us Well follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believst no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath AARON What if I do not As indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sisters tongue and ravished her And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest LUCIUS O detestable villain callst thou that trimming AARON Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons heads Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the empress of this sport She sounded almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses GOTH What canst thou say all this and never blush AARON Ay like a black dog as the saying is LUCIUS Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds AARON Ay that I had not done a thousand more Even now I curse the day and yet I think Few come within the compass of my curse Wherein I did not some notorious ill As kill a man or else devise his death Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it Accuse some innocent and forswear myself Set deadly enmity between two friends Make poor mens cattle break their necks Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night And bid the owners quench them with their tears Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves And set them upright at their dear friends door Even when their sorrows almost was forgot And on their skins as on the bark of trees Have with my knife carved in Roman letters Let not your sorrow die though I am dead But I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand more LUCIUS Bring down the devil for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presently AARON If there be devils would I were a devil To live and burn in everlasting fire So I might have your company in hell But to torment you with my bitter tongue LUCIUS Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more Enter Aemilius GOTH My lord there is a messenger from Rome Desires to be admitted to your presence LUCIUS Let him come near Welcome Aemilius Whats the news from Rome AEMILIUS Lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths The Roman emperor greets you all by me And for he understands you are in arms He craves a parley at your fathers house Willing you to demand your hostages And they shall be immediately delivered FIRST GOTH What says our general LUCIUS Aemilius let the emperor give his pledges Unto my father and my uncle Marcus And we will come March away Exeunt SCENE II Rome Before

towards Rome a band of warlike Goths And bid him come and banquet at thy house When he is here even at thy solemn feast I will bring in the empress and her sons The emperor himself and all thy foes

letters I have sent and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter These good fellows will bring thee where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England of them I have much to tell thee Farewell He that thou knowest thine HAMLET Come I will give you way for these your letters And dot the speedier that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them Exeunt SCENE VII Another room in the Castle Enter King and Laertes KING Now must your conscience my acquittance seal And you must put me in your heart for friend Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear That he which hath your noble father slain Pursud my life LAERTES It well appears But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats So crimeful and so capital in nature As by your safety wisdom all things else You mainly were stirrd up KING O for two special reasons Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd But yet to me they are strong The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks and for myself My virtue or my plague be it either which Shes so conjunctive to my life and soul That as the star moves not but in his sphere I could not but by her The other motive Why to a public count I might not go Is the great love the general gender bear him Who dipping all his faults in their affection Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows Too slightly timberd for so loud a wind Would have reverted to my bow again And not where I had aimd them LAERTES And so have I a noble father lost A sister driven into desperate terms Whose worth if praises may go back again Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections But my revenge will come KING Break not your sleeps for that You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more I lovd your father and we love ourself And that I hope will teach you to imagine Enter a Messenger How now What news MESSENGER Letters my lord from Hamlet This to your Majesty this to the Queen KING From Hamlet Who brought them MESSENGER Sailors my lord they say I saw them not They were given me by Claudio He receivd them Of him that brought them KING Laertes you shall hear them Leave us Exit Messenger Reads High and mighty you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes When I shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return HAMLET What should this mean Are all the rest come back Or is it some abuse and no such thing LAERTES Know you the hand KING Tis Hamlets character Naked And in a postscript here he says alone Can you advise me LAERTES I am lost in it my lord But let him come It warms the very sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth Thus diest thou KING If it be so Laertes As how should it be so How otherwise Will you be ruld by me LAERTES Ay my lord So you will not oerrule me to a peace KING To thine own peace If he be now returnd As checking at his voyage and that he means No more to undertake it I will work him To an exploit now ripe in my device Under the which he shall not choose but fall And for his death no wind shall breathe But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident LAERTES My lord I will be ruld The rather if you could devise it so That I might be the organ KING It falls right You have been talkd of since your travel much And that in Hamlets hearing for a quality Wherein they say you shine Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one and that in my regard Of the unworthiest siege LAERTES What part is that my lord KING A very riband in the cap of youth Yet needful too for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds Importing health and graveness Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy Ive seen myself and servd against the French And they can well on horseback but this gallant Had witchcraft int He grew unto his seat And to such wondrous doing brought his horse As had he been incorpsd and deminaturd With the brave beast So far he toppd my thought That I in forgery of shapes and tricks Come short of what he did LAERTES A Norman wast KING A Norman LAERTES Upon my life Lamord KING The very same LAERTES I know him well He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation KING He made confession of you And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most especially That he cried out twould be a sight indeed If one could match you The scrimers of their nation He swore had neither motion guard nor eye If you opposd them Sir this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming oer to play with him Now out of this LAERTES What out of this my lord KING Laertes was your father dear to you Or are you like the painting of a sorrow A face without a heart LAERTES Why ask you this KING Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know love is begun by time And that I see in passages of proof Time qualifies the spark and fire of it There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it And nothing is at a like goodness still For goodness growing to a pleurisy Dies in his own too much That we would do We should do when we would for this would changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues are hands are accidents And then this should is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing But to the quick o thulcer Hamlet comes back what would you undertake To show yourself your fathers son in deed More than in words LAERTES To cut his throat i th church KING No place indeed should murder sanctuarize Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes Will you do this keep close within your chamber Hamlet returnd shall know you are come home Well put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together And wager on your heads He being remiss Most generous and free from all contriving Will not peruse the foils so that with ease Or with a little shuffling you may choose A sword unbated and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father LAERTES I will dot And for that purpose Ill anoint my sword I bought an unction of a mountebank So mortal that but dip a knife in it Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon can save the thing from death This is but scratchd withal Ill touch my point With this contagion that if I gall him slightly It may be death KING Lets further think of this Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape If this should fail And that our drift look through our bad performance Twere better not assayd Therefore this project Should have a back or second that might hold If this did blast in proof Soft let me see Well make a solemn wager on your cunnings I hat When in your motion you are hot and dry As make your bouts more violent to that end And that he calls for drink Ill have prepard him A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping If he by chance escape your venomd stuck Our purpose may hold there Enter Queen How now sweet Queen QUEEN One woe doth tread upon anothers heel So fast they follow Your sisters drownd Laertes LAERTES Drownd O where QUEEN There is a willow grows aslant a brook That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream There with fantastic garlands did she make Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples That liberal shepherds give a grosser name But our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clambring to hang an envious sliver broke When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide And mermaidlike awhile they bore her up Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes As one incapable of her own distress Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element But long it could not beTill that her garments heavy with their drink Pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death LAERTES Alas then she is drownd QUEEN Drownd drownd LAERTES Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia And therefore I forbid my tears But yet It is our trick nature her custom holds Let shame say what it will When these are gone The woman will be out Adieu my lord I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze But that this folly douts it Exit KING Lets follow Gertrude How much I had to do to calm his rage Now fear I this will give it start again Therefore lets follow Exeunt ACT V SCENE I A churchyard Enter two Clowns with spades c

conditioned thou shalt build from men Hate all curse all show charity to none But let the famished flesh slide from the bone Ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs What thou deniest to men let prisons swallow em Debts wither em to nothing be men like blasted woods And may diseases lick up their false bloodsAnd so farewell and thrive FLAVIUS O let me stay And comfort you my master TIMON If thou hatst curses Stay not Fly whilst thourt blest and free Neer see thou man and let me neer see thee Exeunt severally ACT V SCENE I The woods Before Timons cave Enter Poet and Painter PAINTER As I took note of the place it cannot be far where he abides POET Whats to be thought of him Does the rumour hold for true that he is so full of gold PAINTER Certain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him He likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum POET Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends PAINTER Nothing else You shall see him a palm in Athens again and flourish with the highest Therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his It will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be a just and true report that goes of his having POET What have you now to present unto him PAINTER Nothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent piece POET I must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming toward him PAINTER Good as the best Promising is the very air o th time it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it Enter Timon from his cave TIMON Aside Excellent workman Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself POET I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him It must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency TIMON Aside Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men Do so I have gold for thee POET Nay lets seek him Then do we sin against our own estate When we may profit meet and come too late PAINTER True When the day serves before blackcornered night Find what thou wantst by free and offered light Come TIMON Aside Ill meet you at the turn What a gods gold That he is worshipped in a baser temple Than where swine feed Tis thou that riggst the bark and ploughst the foam Settlest admired reverence in a slave To thee be worship and thy saints for aye Be crowned with plagues that thee alone obey Fit I meet them He comes forward POET Hail worthy Timon PAINTER Our late noble master TIMON Have I once lived to see two honest men POET Sir Having often of your open bounty tasted Hearing you were retired your friends falln off Whose thankless naturesO abhorred spirits Not all the whips of heaven are large enough What to you Whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence To their whole being I am rapt and cannot cover The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude With any size of words TIMON Let it go naked Men may seet the better You that are honest by being what you are Make them best seen and known PAINTER He and myself Have travailed in the great shower of your gifts And sweetly felt it TIMON Ay you are honest men PAINTER We are hither come to offer you our service TIMON Most honest men Why how shall I requite you Can you eat roots and drink cold water No BOTH What we can do well do to do you service TIMON Yere honest men Yeve heard that I have gold I am sure you have Speak truth youre honest men PAINTER So it is said my noble lord but therefore Came not my friend nor I TIMON Good honest men To Painter Thou drawst a counterfeit Best in all Athens Thourt indeed the best Thou counterfeitst most lively PAINTER So so my lord TIMON Een so sir as I say To the Poet And for thy fiction Why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth That thou art even natural in thine art But for all this my honestnatured friends I must needs say you have a little fault Marry tis not monstrous in you neither wish I You take much pains to mend BOTH Beseech your honour To make it known to us TIMON Youll take it ill BOTH Most thankfully my lord TIMON Will you indeed BOTH Doubt it not worthy lord TIMON Theres never a one of you but trusts a knave That mightily deceives you BOTH Do we my lord TIMON Ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble Know his gross patchery love him feed him Keep in your bosom yet remain assured That hes a madeup villain PAINTER I know not such my lord POET Nor I TIMON Look you I love you well Ill give you gold Rid me these villains from your companies Hang them or stab them drown them in a draught Confound them by some course and come to me Ill give you gold enough BOTH Name them my lord lets know them TIMON You that way and you this but two in company Each man apart all single and alone Yet an archvillain keeps him company To one If where thou art two villians shall not be Come not near him To the other If thou wouldst not reside But where one villain is then him abandon Hence pack Theres gold You came for gold ye slaves To one You have work for me theres payment hence To the other You are an alchemist make gold of that Out rascal dogs Timon drives them out and then retires to his cave SCENE II The same Enter Flavius and two Senators FLAVIUS It is vain that you would speak with Timon For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself

forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee The senators with one consent of love Entreat thee back to Athens who have thought On special dignities which vacant lie For thy best use and wearing SECOND SENATOR They confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross Which now the public body which doth seldom Play the recanter feeling in itself A lack of Timons aid hath sense withal Of its own fall restraining aid to Timon And send forth us to make their sorrowed render Together with a recompense more fruitful Than their offence can weigh down by the dram Ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs And write in thee the figures of their love Ever to read them thine TIMON You witch me in it Surprise me to the very brink of tears Lend me a fools heart and a womans eyes And Ill beweep these comforts worthy senators FIRST SENATOR Therefore so please thee to return with us And of our Athens thine and ours to take The captainship thou shalt be met with thanks Allowed with absolute power and thy good name Live with authority So soon we shall drive back Of Alcibiades th approaches wild Who like a boar too savage doth root up His countrys peace SECOND SENATOR And shakes his threatening sword Against the walls of Athens FIRST SENATOR Therefore Timon TIMON Well sir I will Therefore I will sir thus If Alcibiades kill my countrymen Let Alcibiades know this of Timon That Timon cares not But if he sack fair Athens And take our goodly aged men by th beards Giving our holy virgins to the stain Of contumelious beastly madbrained war Then let him know and tell him Timon speaks it In pity of our aged and our youth I cannot choose but tell him that I care not Andlet him taket at worstfor their knives care not While you have throats to answer For myself Theres not a whittle in th unruly camp But I do prize it at my love before The reverendst throat in Athens So I leave you To the protection of the prosperous gods As thieves to keepers FLAVIUS Stay not alls in vain TIMON Why I was writing of my epitaph It will be seen tomorrow My long sickness Of health and living now begins to mend And nothing brings me all things Go live still Be Alcibiades your plague you his And last so long enough FIRST SENATOR We speak in vain TIMON But yet I love my country and am not One that rejoices in the common wrack As common bruit doth put it FIRST SENATOR Thats well spoke TIMON Commend me to my loving countrymen FIRST SENATOR These words become your lips as they pass through them SECOND SENATOR And enter in our ears like great triumphers In their applauding gates TIMON Commend me to them And tell them that to ease them of their griefs Their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses Their pangs of love with other incident throes That natures fragile vessel doth sustain In lifes uncertain voyage I will some kindness do them Ill teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades wrath FIRST SENATOR Aside I like this well he will return again TIMON I have a tree which grows here in my close That mine own use invites me to cut down And shortly must I fell it Tell my friends Tell Athens in the sequence of degree From high to low throughout that whoso please To stop affliction let him take his haste Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe And hang himself I pray you do my greeting FLAVIUS Trouble him no further thus you still shall find him TIMON Come not to me again but say to Athens Timon hath made his everlasting mansion Upon the beached verge of the salt flood Who once a day with his embossed froth The turbulent surge shall cover thither come And let my gravestone be your oracle Lips let sour words go by and language end What is amiss plague and infection mend Graves only be mens works and death their gain Sun hide thy beams Timon hath done his reign Exit Timon into his cave FIRST SENATOR His discontents are unremovablyCoupled to nature SECOND SENATOR Our hope in him is dead Let us return And strain what other means is left unto us In our dear peril FIRST SENATOR It requires swift foot Exeunt SCENE III Before the walls of Athens Enter two other Senators with a Messenger FIRST SENATOR Thou hast painfully discovered Are his files As full as thy report MESSENGER I have spoke the least Besides his expedition promises Present approach SECOND SENATOR We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon MESSENGER I met a courier one mine ancient friend Whom though in general part we were opposed Yet our old love made a particular force And made us speak like friends This man was riding From Alcibiades to Timons cave With letters of entreaty which imported His fellowship i th cause against your city In part for his sake moved Enter the other Senators from Timon THIRD SENATOR Here come our

sound Enter Alcibiades with his powers before Athens ALCIBIADES Sound to this coward and lascivious town Our terrible approach A parley sounds The Senators appear upon the walls Till now you have gone on and filled the time With all licentious measure making your wills The scope of justice Till now myself and such As slept within the shadow of your power Have wandered with our traversed arms and breathed Our sufferance vainly Now the time is flush When crouching marrow in the bearer strong Cries of itself No more Now breathless wrong Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease And pursy insolence shall break his wind With fear and horrid flight FIRST SENATOR Noble and young When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear We sent to thee to give thy rages balm To wipe out our ingratitude with loves Above their quantity SECOND SENATOR So did we woo Transformed Timon to our citys love By humble message and by promised means We were not all unkind nor all deserve The common stroke of war FIRST SENATOR These walls of ours Were not erected by their hands from whom You have received your griefs nor are they such That these great towers trophies and schools should fall For private faults in them SECOND SENATOR Nor are they living Who were the motives that you first went out Shame that they wanted cunning in excess Hath broke their hearts March noble lord Into our city with thy banners spread By decimation and a tithed death If thy revenges hunger for that food Which nature loathes take thou the destined tenth And by the hazard of the spotted die Let die the spotted FIRST SENATOR All have not offended For those that were it is not square to take On those that are revenge Crimes like lands Are not inherited Then dear countryman Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall With those that have offended Like a shepherd Approach the fold and cull th infected forth But kill not all together SECOND SENATOR What thou wilt Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile Than hew to t with thy sword FIRST SENATOR Set but thy foot Against our rampired gates and they shall ope So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before To say thoult enter friendly SECOND SENATOR Throw thy glove Or any token of thine honour else That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress And not as our confusion all thy powers Shall make their harbour in our town till we Have sealed thy full desire ALCIBIADES Then theres my glove Descend and open your uncharged ports Those enemies of Timons and mine own Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof Fall and no more And to atone your fears With my more noble meaning not a man Shall pass his quarter or offend

probable I do not knowthat Martius Joined with Aufidius leads a power gainst Rome And vows revenge as spacious as betweenThe youngst and oldest thing SICINIUS This is most likely BRUTUS Raised only that the weaker sort may wish Good Martius home again SICINIUS The very trick on t MENENIUS This is unlikely He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violentst contrariety Enter a Second Messenger SECOND MESSENGER You are sent for to the Senate A fearful army led by Caius Martius Associated with Aufidius rages Upon our territories and have already Oerborne their way consumed with fire and took

see your wives dishonoured to your noses MENENIUS Whats the news Whats the news COMINIUS Your temples burned in their cement and Your franchises whereon you stood confined Into an augers bore MENENIUS Pray now your news You have made fair work I fear mePray your news If Martius should be joined with Volscians COMINIUS If He is their god he leads them like a thing Made by some other deity than Nature That shapes man better and they follow him Against us brats with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies Or butchers killing flies MENENIUS You have made good work You and your apronmen you that stood so much Upon the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic eaters COMINIUS Hell shake your Rome about your ears MENENIUS As Hercules did shake down mellow fruit You have made fair work BRUTUS But is this true sir COMINIUS Ay and youll look pale Before you find it other All the regions Do smilingly revolt and who resists Are mocked for valiant ignorance And perish constant fools Who ist can blame him Your enemies and his find something in him MENENIUS We are all undone unless The noble man have mercy COMINIUS Who shall ask it The Tribunes cannot dot for shame the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds For his best friends if they Should say Be good to Rome they charged him even As those should do that had deserved his hate And therein showed like enemies MENENIUS Tis true If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it I have not the face To say Beseech you ceaseYou have made fair hands You and your crafts You have crafted fair COMINIUS You have brought A trembling upon Rome such as was never S incapable of help TRIBUNES Say not we brought it MENENIUS How Was it we We loved him but like beasts And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters Who did hoot him out o th city COMINIUS But I fear Theyll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius The second name of men obeys his points As if he were his officer Desperation Is all the policy strength and defence That Rome can make against them Enter a troop of Citizens MENENIUS Here comes the clusters And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus exile Now hes coming And not a hair upon a soldiers head Which will not prove a whip As many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down And pay you for your voices Tis no matter If he could burn us all into one coal We have deserved it ALL CITIZENS Faith we hear fearful news FIRST CITIZEN For mine own part When I said banish him I said twas pity SECOND CITIZEN And so did I THIRD CITIZEN And so did I And to say the truth so did very many of us That we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will COMINIUS You are goodly things you voices MENENIUS You have made good work you and your cry Shalls to the Capitol COMINIUS O ay what else Exeunt Cominius and Menenius SICINIUS Go masters get you home Be not dismayed These are a side that would be glad to have This true which they so seem to fear Go home And show no sign of fear FIRST CITIZEN The gods be good to us Come masters lets home I ever said we were i th wrong when we banished him SECOND CITIZEN So did we all But come lets home Exeunt Citizens BRUTUS I do not like this news

AUFIDIUS Do they still fly to th Roman LIEUTENANT I do not know what witchcrafts in him but Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat Their talk at table and their thanks at end And you are darkned in this action sir Even by your own AUFIDIUS I cannot help it now Unless by using means I lame the foot Of our design He bears himself more proudlier Even to my person than I thought he would When first I did embrace him Yet his nature In thats no changeling and I must excuse What cannot be amended LIEUTENANT Yet I wish sir I mean for your particularyou had not Joined in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solely AUFIDIUS I understand thee well and be thou sure When he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state Fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon As draw his sword yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine Wheneer we come to our account LIEUTENANT Sir I beseech you think you hell carry Rome AUFIDIUS All places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his The Senators and Patricians love him too The Tribunes are no soldiers and their people Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty To expel him thence I think hell be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish who takes it By sovereignty of nature First he was A noble servant to them but he could not Carry his honours even Whether twas pride Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From th casque to th cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controlled the war but one of these As he hath spices of them allnot all For I dare so far free himmade him feared So hated and so banished But he has a merit To choke it in the uttrance So our virtues Lie in th interpretation of the time And power unto itself most commendable Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair T extol what it hath done One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail Come lets away When Caius Rome is thine Thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Rome A public place Enter Menenius Cominius Sicinius Brutus the two Tribunes with others MENENIUS No Ill not go You hear what he hath said Which was

coyed To hear Cominius speak Ill keep at home COMINIUS He would not seem to know me MENENIUS Do you hear COMINIUS Yet one time he did call me by my name I urged our old acquaintance and the drops That we have bled together Coriolanus He would not answer to forbade all names He was a kind of nothing titleless Till he had forged himself a name i th fire Of burning Rome MENENIUS Why so you have made good work A pair of tribunes that have wracked Rome To make coals cheap A noble memory COMINIUS I minded him how royal twas to pardon When it was less expected He replied It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punished MENENIUS Very well Could he say less COMINIUS I offered to awaken his regard Fors private friends His answer to me was He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff He said twas folly For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt And still to nose th offence MENENIUS For one poor grain or two I am one of those His mother wife his child And this brave fellow too we are the grains You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon We must be burnt for you SICINIUS Nay pray be patient If you refuse your aid In this soneverneeded help yet do not Upbraids with our distress But sure if you Would be your countrys pleader your good tongue More than the instant army we can make Might stop our countryman MENENIUS No Ill not meddle SICINIUS Pray you go to him MENENIUS What should I do BRUTUS Only make trial what your love can do For Rome towards Martius MENENIUS Well and say that Martius Return me as Cominius is returned unheard What then But as a discontented friend Griefshot with his unkindness Sayt be so SICINIUS Yet your good will Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure As you intended well MENENIUS Ill undertaket I think hell hear me Yet to bite his lip And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me He was not taken well he had not dined The veins unfilled our blood is cold and then We pout upon the morning are unapt To give or to forgive but when we have stuffed These pipes and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding we have suppler souls Than in our priestlike fasts Therefore Ill watch him Till he be dieted to my request And then Ill set upon him BRUTUS You know the very road into his kindness And cannot lose your way MENENIUS Good faith Ill prove him Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success Exit COMINIUS Hell never hear him SICINIUS Not COMINIUS I tell you he does sit in gold his eye Red as twould burn Rome and his injury The jailer to his pity I kneeled before him Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissed me Thus with his speechless hand What he would do He sent in writing after me what he Would not bound with an oath to yield to his Conditions So that all hope is vain Unless his noble mother and his wife Who as I hear mean to solicit him For mercy to his country Therefore lets hence And with our fair entreaties haste them on Exeunt SCENE II An Advanced

whence men have read His fame unparalleled happily amplified For I have ever verified my friends Of whom hes chiefwith all the size that verity Would without lapsing suffer Nay sometimes Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise Have almost stamped the leasing Therefore fellow I must have leave to pass FIRST WATCH Faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely Therefore go back MENENIUS Prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius always factionary on the party of your general SECOND WATCH Howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have I am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass Therefore go back MENENIUS Has he dined canst thou tell For I would not speak with him till after dinner FIRST WATCH You are a Roman are you MENENIUS I am as thy general is FIRST WATCH Then you should hate Rome as he does Can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this No you are deceived Therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution You are condemned Our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon MENENIUS Sirrah if thy captain knew I were here he would use me with estimation SECOND WATCH Come my captain knows you not MENENIUS I mean thy general FIRST WATCH My general cares not for you Back I say go lest I let forth your

hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee to Coriolanus The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does O my son my son Thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres water to quench it I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen The good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee CORIOLANUS Away MENENIUS How Away CORIOLANUS Wife mother child I know not My affairs Are servanted to others Though I owe My revenge properly my remission lies In Volscian breasts That we have been familiar Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather Than pity note how much Therefore begone Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force Yet for I loved thee Take this along I writ it for thy sake He gives Menenius a paper And would have sent it Another word Menenius I will not hear thee speakThis man Aufidius Was my beloved in Rome yet thou beholdst AUFIDIUS You keep a constant temper They exit The Guard and Menenius remain FIRST WATCH Now sir is your name Menenius SECOND WATCH Tis a spell you see of much power You know the way home again FIRST WATCH Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your Greatness back SECOND WATCH What cause do you think I have to swoon

never admitted A private whisper no not with such friends That thought them sure of you CORIOLANUS This last old man Whom with cracked heart I have sent to Rome Loved me above the measure of a father Nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge Was to send him for whose old love I have Though I showed sourly to himonce more offered The first conditions which they did refuse And cannot now accept to grace him only That thought he could do more A very little I have yielded to Fresh embassies and suits Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter Will I lend ear to Shout within Ha What shout is this Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow In the same time tis made I will not Enter Virgilia Volumnia Valeria young Martius with attendants My wife comes foremost then the honoured mold Wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand The grandchild to her blood But out affection All bond and privilege of nature break Let it be virtuous to be obstinate What is that curtsy worth Or those doves eyes Which can make gods forsworn I melt and am not Of stronger earth than others My mother bows As if Olympus to a molehill should In supplication nod and my young boy Hath an aspect of intercession which Great Nature cries Deny not Let the Volsces Plough Rome and harrow Italy Ill never Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand As if a man were author of himself And knew no other kin VIRGILIA My lord and husband CORIOLANUS These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome VIRGILIA The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so CORIOLANUS"

As many vouchd rarities are GONZALO That our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather newdyed than stained with salt water ANTONIO If but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies SEBASTIAN Ay or very falsely pocket up his report GONZALO Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the Kings fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis SEBASTIAN Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return ADRIAN Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their Queen GONZALO Not since widow Didos time ANTONIO Widow a pox o that How came that widow in Widow Dido SEBASTIAN What if he had said widower Aeneas too Good Lord how you take it ADRIAN Widow Dido

SEBASTIAN He hath raisd the wall and houses too ANTONIO What impossible matter will he make easy next SEBASTIAN I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple ANTONIO And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands ALONSO Ay ANTONIO Why in good time GONZALO To Alonso Sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now Queen ANTONIO And the rarest that eer came there SEBASTIAN Bate I beseech you widow Dido ANTONIO O widow Dido ay widow Dido GONZALO Is not sir my

aside and breasted The surge most swoln that met him His bold head Bove the contentious waves he kept and oared Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To th shore that oer his waveworn basis bowed As stooping to relieve him I not doubt He came alive to land ALONSO No no hes gone SEBASTIAN Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss That would not bless our Europe with your daughter But rather lose her to an African Where she at least is banishd from your eye Who hath cause to wet the grief on t ALONSO Prithee peace SEBASTIAN You were kneeld to and importund otherwise By all of us and the fair soul herself Weighd between loathness and obedience at Which end o th beam should bow We have lost your son I fear for ever Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business

speak SEBASTIAN I do and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speakst Out of thy sleep What is it thou didst say This is a strange repose to be asleep With eyes wide open standing speaking moving And yet so fast asleep ANTONIO Noble Sebastian Thou letst thy fortune sleepdie rather winkst Whiles thou art waking SEBASTIAN Thou dost snore distinctly Theres meaning in thy snores ANTONIO I am more serious than my custom you Must be so too if heed me which to do Trebles thee oer SEBASTIAN Well I am standing water ANTONIO Ill teach you how to flow SEBASTIAN Do so to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me ANTONIO O If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it You more invest it Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth SEBASTIAN Prithee say on The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield ANTONIO Thus sir Although this lord of weak remembrance this Who shall be of as little memory When he is earthd hath here almost persuaded For hes a spirit of persuasion only Professes to persuadethe King his sons alive Tis as impossible that hes undrownd As he that sleeps here swims SEBASTIAN I have no hope That hes undrownd ANTONIO O out of that no hope What great hope have you No hope that way isAnother way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond But doubts discovery there Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drownd SEBASTIAN Hes gone ANTONIO Then tell me Whos the next heir of Naples SEBASTIAN Claribel ANTONIO She that

How say you Tis true my brothers daughters Queen of Tunis So is she heir of Naples twixt which regions There is some space ANTONIO A space whose evry cubit Seems to cry out How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples Keep in Tunis And let Sebastian wake Say this were death That now hath seizd them why they were no worse Than now they are There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo I myself could make A chough of as deep chat O that you bore The mind that I do What a sleep were this For your advancement Do you understand me SEBASTIAN Methinks I do ANTONIO And how does your content Tender your own good fortune SEBASTIAN I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero ANTONIO True And look how well my garments sit upon me Much feater than before my brothers servants Were then my fellows now they are my men SEBASTIAN But for your conscience ANTONIO Ay sir where lies that If twere a kibe Twould put me to my slipper but I feel not This deity in my bosom twenty consciences That stand twixt me and Milan candied be they And melt ere they molest Here lies your brother No better than the earth he lies upon If he were that which now hes like thats dead Whom I with this obedient steel three inches of it Can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel this Sir Prudence who Should not upbraid our course For all the rest Theyll take suggestion as a cat laps milk Theyll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour SEBASTIAN Thy case dear friend Shall be my precedent as thou gotst Milan Ill come by Naples Draw thy sword one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest And I the King shall love thee ANTONIO Draw together And when I rear my hand do you the like To fall it on Gonzalo SEBASTIAN O but one word They converse apart Music Reenter Ariel invisible ARIEL My master through his art foresees the danger That you his friend are in and sends me forth For else his project diesto keep them living Sings in Gonzalos ear While you here do snoring lie Openeyd conspiracy His time doth take If of life you keep a care Shake off slumber and beware Awake awake ANTONIO Then let us both be sudden GONZALO Now good angels Preserve the King They wake ALONSO Why how now Ho awake Why are you drawn Wherefore this ghastly looking GONZALO Whats the matter SEBASTIAN Whiles we stood here securing your repose Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls or rather lions did t not wake you It struck mine

hath Ulysses here discoverd The fever whereof all our power is sick AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedy ULYSSES The great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries Excellent Tis Agamemnon right Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration Thats doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger ULYSSES

strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies weight Why this hath not a fingers dignity They call this bedwork mappry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution NESTOR Let this be granted and Achilles horse Makes many Thetis sons Tucket AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus MENELAUS From Troy Enter Aeneas AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent AENEAS Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you AGAMEMNON Even this AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles arm Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals AGAMEMNON How AENEAS Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers AENEAS Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd As bending angels thats their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Joves accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praisd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends AGAMEMNON Sir you of Troy call you

hour That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake He tells thee so himself AENEAS Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fairst of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That feeds his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none hell say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so much AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hectors grandsire suckd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put this witherd brawns And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood Ill prove this troth with my three drops of blood AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ULYSSES Amen AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you sir Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor ULYSSES Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape NESTOR What ist ULYSSES This tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be croppd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all NESTOR Well and how ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgement Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose Pointing on him ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you NESTOR Why tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute With their finst palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly poisd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large It is supposd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As twere from forth us all a man distilld Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertaind limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance theyll sell If not the lustre of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are doggd with two strange followers NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should share with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foild Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lottry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off Well dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our projects life this shape of sense assumes Ajax employd plucks down Achilles plumes NESTOR Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone Exeunt ACT II SCENE I The Grecian camp Enter Ajax and Thersites AJAX Thersites THERSITES Agamemnonhow if he had

common ounces Will you with counters sum The pastproportion of his infinite And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons Fie for godly shame HELENUS No marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons You are so empty of them Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason Because your speech hath none that tells him so TROILUS You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons You know an enemy intends you harm You know a sword employd is perilous And reason flies the object of all harm Who marvels then when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove Or like a star disorbd Nay if we talk of reason Lets shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honour Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts With this crammd reason Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject HECTOR Brother she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping TROILUS Whats aught but as tis valued HECTOR But value dwells not in particular will It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein tis precious of itself As in the prizer Tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the god And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects Without some image of thaffected merit TROILUS I take today a wife and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears Two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgement how may I avoid Although my will distaste what it elected The wife I chose There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soild them nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve Because we now are full It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks Your breath with full consent bellied his sails The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce And did him service He touchd the ports desird And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollos and makes stale the morning Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl Whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships And turnd crownd kings to merchants If youll avouch twas wisdom Paris went As you must needs for you all cried Go go If youll confess he brought home worthy prize As you must needs for you all clappd your hands And cried Inestimablewhy do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate And do a deed that never Fortune did Beggar the estimation which you prizd Richer than sea and land O theft most base That we have stoln what we do fear to keep But thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans cry PRIAM What noise what shriek is this TROILUS Tis our mad sister I do know her voice CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans HECTOR It is Cassandra Enter Cassandra raving CASSANDRA Cry Trojans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes And I will fill them with prophetic tears HECTOR Peace sister peace CASSANDRA Virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to comeCry Trojans cry Practise your eyes with tears Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all Cry Trojans cry A Helen and a woe Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go Exit HECTOR Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse Or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause Can qualify the same TROILUS Why brother Hector We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandras mad Her brainsick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engagd To make it gracious For my private part I am no more touchd than all Priams sons And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain PARIS Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels But I attest the gods your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project For what alas can these my single arms What propugnation is in one mans valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite Yet I protest Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will Paris should neer retract what he hath done Nor faint in the pursuit PRIAM Paris you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights You have the honey still but these the gall So to be valiant is no praise at all PARIS Sir I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wipd off in honourable keeping her What treason were it to the ransackd queen Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms Theres not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamd Where Helen is the subject Then I say Well may we fight for her whom we know well The worlds large spaces cannot parallel HECTOR Paris and Troilus you have both said well And on the cause and question now in hand Have glozd but superficially not much Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distempred blood Than to make up a free determination Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision Nature craves All dues be rendred to their owners Now What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection And that great minds of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills resist the same There is a law in each wellorderd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory If Helen then be wife to Spartas king As it is known she isthese moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back returnd Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong But makes it much more heavy Hectors opinion Is this in way of truth Yet neertheless My spritely brethren I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still For tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignities TROILUS Why there you touchd the life of our design Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector She is a theme of honour and renown A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds Whose present courage may beat down our foes And fame in time to come canonize us For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promisd glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide worlds revenue HECTOR I am yours You valiant offspring of great Priamus I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits I was advertisd their great general slept Whilst emulation in the army crept This I presume will wake him Exeunt SCENE III The Grecian camp Before the tent of Achilles Enter Thersites solus THERSITES How now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he raild at me Sfoot Ill learn to conjure and raise devils but Ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then theres Achilles a rare engineer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunderdarter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which shortarmd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan boneache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say Amen What ho my Lord Achilles Enter Patroclus PATROCLUS Whos there Thersites Good Thersites come in and rail THERSITES If I could a remembred a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slippd out of my contemplation but it

He is not sick AJAX Yes lionsick sick of proud heart You may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head tis pride But why why Let him show us a cause A word my lord Takes Agamemnon aside NESTOR What moves Ajax thus to bay at him ULYSSES Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him NESTOR Who Thersites ULYSSES He NESTOR Then will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument ULYSSES No you see he is his argument that has his argument Achilles NESTOR All the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite ULYSSES The amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie Reenter Patroclus Here comes Patroclus NESTOR No Achilles with him ULYSSES The elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure PATROCLUS Achilles bids me say he is much sorry If any thing more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state To call upon him he hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake An afterdinners breath AGAMEMNON Hear you Patroclus We are too well acquainted with these answers But his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn Cannot outfly our apprehensions Much attribute he hath and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues Not virtuously on his own part beheld Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him We come to speak with him and you shall not sin If you do say we think him overproud And underhonest in selfassumption greater Than in the note of judgement and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on Disguise the holy strength of their command And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance yea watch His course and time his ebbs and flows as if The passage and whole stream of this commencement Rode on his tide Go tell him this and add That if he overhold his price so much Well none of him but let him like an engine Not portable lie under this report Bring action hither this cannot go to war A stirring dwarf we do allowance give Before a sleeping giant Tell him so

Why will he not upon our fair request Untent his person and share thair with us ULYSSES Things small as nothing for requests sake only He makes important possessd he is with greatness And speaks not

Attendant with glass Give me that glass and therein will I read No deeper wrinkles yet Hath sorrow struck So many blows upon this face of mine And made no deeper wounds O flattring glass Like to my followers in prosperity Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men Was this the face That like the sun did make beholders wink Is this the face which faced so many follies That was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke A brittle glory shineth in this face As brittle as the glory is the face Dashes the glass against the ground For there it is cracked in an hundred shivers Mark silent king the moral of this sport How soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face BOLINGBROKE The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed The shadow of your face KING RICHARD Say that again The shadow of my sorrow Ha lets see Tis very true my grief lies all within And these external manner of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortured soul There lies the substance And I thank thee king For thy great bounty that not only givst Me cause to wail but teachest me the way How to lament the cause Ill beg one boon And then be gone and trouble you no more Shall I obtain it BOLINGBROKE Name it fair cousin KING RICHARD Fair cousin I am greater than a king For when I was a king my flatterers Were then but subjects Being now a subject I have a king here to my flatterer Being so great I have no need to beg BOLINGBROKE Yet ask KING RICHARD And shall I have BOLINGBROKE You shall KING RICHARD Then give me leave to

Richard Thou most beauteous inn Why should hardfavoured grief be lodged in thee When triumph is become an alehouse guest KING RICHARD Join not with grief fair woman do not so To make my end too sudden Learn good soulTo think our former state a happy dream From which awaked the truth of what we are Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet To grim Necessity and he and I Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France And cloister thee in some religious house Our holy lives must win a new worlds crown Which our profane hours here have thrown down QUEEN What is my Richard both in shape and mind Transformed and weakened Hath Bolingbroke Deposed thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage To be oerpowered and wilt thou pupillike Take the correction mildly kiss the rod And fawn on rage with base humility Which art a lion and the king of beasts KING RICHARD A king of beasts indeed If aught but beasts I had been still a happy king of men Good sometimes queen prepare thee hence for France Think I am dead and that even here thou takst As from my deathbed thy last living leave In winters tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs Tell thou the lamentable tale of me And send the hearers weeping to their beds For why the senseless brands will sympathize The heavy accent of thy moving tongue And in compassion weep the fire out And some will mourn in ashes some coalblack For the deposing of a rightful king Enter Northumberland attended NORTHUMBERLAND My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changed You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower And madam there is order taen for you With all swift speed you must away to France KING RICHARD Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne The time shall not be many hours of age More than it is ere foul sin gathering head Shall break into corruption Thou shalt think Though he divide the realm and give thee half It is too little helping him to all And he shall think that thou which knowst the way To plant unrightful kings wilt know again Being neer so little urged another way To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne The love of wicked men converts to fear That fear to hate and hate turns one or both To worthy danger and deserved death NORTHUMBERLAND My guilt be on my head and there an end Take leave and part for you must part forthwith KING RICHARD Doubly divorced Bad men you violate A twofold marriage twixt my crown and me And then betwixt me and my married wife Let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me And yet not so for with a kiss twas made Part us Northumberland I towards the north Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp She came adorned hither like sweet May Sent back like Hallowmas or shortst of day QUEEN And must we be divided Must we part KING RICHARD Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart QUEEN Banish us both and send the King with me NORTHUMBERLAND That were some love but little policy QUEEN Then whither he goes thither let me go KING RICHARD So two together weeping make one woe Weep thou for me in France I for thee here Better far off than near be neer the near Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans QUEEN So longest way shall have the longest moans KING RICHARD Twice for one step Ill groan the way being short And piece the way out with a heavy heart Come come in wooing sorrow lets be brief Since wedding it there is such length in grief One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart They kiss QUEEN Give me mine own again twere no good part To take on me to keep and kill thy heart They kiss again So now I have mine own again be gone That I may strive to kill it with a groan KING RICHARD We make woe wanton with this fond delay Once more adieu The rest let sorrow say Exeunt SCENE II The same A room in the Duke of Yorks palace Enter York and his Duchess DUCHESS My Lord you told me you would tell the rest When weeping made you break the story off Of our two cousins coming into London YORK Where did I leave DUCHESS At that sad stop my lord Where rude misgoverned hands from windows tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head YORK Then as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed Which his aspiring rider seemed to know With slow but stately pace kept on his course Whilst all tongues cried God save thee Bolingbroke You would have thought the very windows spake So many greedy looks of young and old Through casements darted their desiring eyes Upon his visage and that all the walls With painted imagery had said at once Jesu preserve thee Welcome Bolingbroke Whilst he from the one side to the other turning Bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck Bespake them thus I thank you countrymen And thus still doing thus he passed along DUCHESS Alack poor Richard Where rode he the whilst YORK As in a theatre the eyes of men After a wellgraced actor leaves the stage Are idly bent on him that enters next Thinking his prattle to be tedious Even so or with much more contempt mens eyes Did scowl on gentle Richard No man cried God save him No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home But dust was thrown upon his sacred head Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off His face still combating with tears and smiles The badges of his grief and patience That had not God for some strong purpose steeled The hearts of men they must perforce have melted And barbarism itself have pitied him But heaven hath a hand in these events To whose high will we bound our calm contents To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now Whose state and honour I for aye allow Enter Aumerle DUCHESS Here comes my son Aumerle YORK Aumerle that was But that is lost for being Richards friend And madam

drunk up with time And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age And rob me of a happy mothers name Is he not like thee Is he not thine own YORK Thou fond mad woman Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy A dozen of them here have taen the sacrament And interchangeably set down their hands To kill the King at Oxford DUCHESS He shall be none Well keep him here Then what is that to him YORK Away fond woman Were he twenty times my son I would appeach him DUCHESS Hadst thou groaned for him As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect That I have been disloyal to thy bed And that he is a bastard not thy son Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind He is as like thee as a man may be Not like to me or any of my kin And yet I love him YORK Make way unruly woman Exit DUCHESS After Aumerle Mount thee upon his horse Spur post and get before him to the King And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee Ill not be long behind Though I be old I doubt not but to ride as fast as York And never will I rise up from the ground Till Bolingbroke have pardoned thee Away be gone Exeunt SCENE III Windsor A room in the Castle Enter Bolingbroke as King Harry Percy and other Lords KING HENRY Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son Tis full three months since I did see him last If any plague hang over us tis he I would to God my lords he might be found Inquire at London mongst the taverns there For there they say he daily doth frequent With unrestrained loose companions Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes And beat our watch and rob our passengers While he young wanton and effeminate boy Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crew PERCY My lord some two days since I saw the Prince And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford KING HENRY And what said the gallant PERCY His answer was he would unto the stews And from the commonst creature pluck a glove And wear it as a favour and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger KING HENRY As dissolute as desperate Yet through both I see some sparks of better hope which elder years May happily bring forth But who comes here Enter Aumerle AUMERLE Where is the King KING HENRY What means our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly AUMERLE God save your Grace I do beseech your majesty To have some conference with your Grace alone KING HENRY Withdraw yourselves and leave us here aloneExeunt Harry Percy and Lords What is the matter with our cousin now AUMERLE Kneels For ever may my knees grow to the earth My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak KING HENRY Intended or committed was this fault If on the first how heinous eer it be To win thy afterlove I pardon thee AUMERLE Then give me leave that I may turn the key That no man enter till my tale be done KING HENRY Have thy desire Aumerle locks the door YORK Within My liege beware Look to thyself Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there KING HENRY

encounter it YORK Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show AUMERLE Remember as thou readst thy promise passed I do repent me Read not my name there My heart is not confederate with my hand YORK It was villain ere thy hand did set it down I tore it from the traitors bosom king Fear and not love begets his penitence Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart KING HENRY O heinous strong and bold conspiracy O loyal father of a treacherous son Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain From whence this stream through muddy passages Hath held his current and defiled himself Thy overflow of good converts to bad And thy abundant goodness shall excuse This deadly blot in thy digressing son YORK So shall my virtue be his vices bawd And he shall spend mine honour with his shame As thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies Thou killst me in his life giving him breath The traitor lives the true mans put to death DUCHESS Within What ho my liege For Gods sake let me in KING HENRY What shrillvoiced suppliant makes this eager cry DUCHESS Within A woman and thine aunt great king tis I Speak with me pity me open the door A beggar begs that never begged before KING HENRY Our scene is altered from a serious thing And now changed to The Beggar and the King My dangerous cousin let your mother in I know shes come to pray for your foul sin Enter Duchess YORK If thou do pardon whosoever pray More sins for this forgiveness prosper may This festered joint cut off the rest rest sound This let alone will all the rest confound DUCHESS O King believe not this hardhearted man Love loving not itself none other can YORK Thou

knee Kneels YORK Against them both my true joints bended be Kneels Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace DUCHESS Pleads he in earnest Look upon his face His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest His words come from his mouth ours from our breast He prays but faintly and would be denied We pray with heart and soul and all beside His weary joints would gladly rise I know Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow His prayers are full of false hypocrisy Ours of true zeal and deep integrity Our prayers do outpray his then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have KING HENRY Good aunt stand up DUCHESS Nay do not say stand up Say pardon first and afterwards stand up An if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach Pardon should be the first word of thy speech I never longed to hear a word till now Say pardon king let pity teach thee how The word is short but not so short as sweet No word like pardon for kings mouths so meet YORK Speak it in French King say pardonne moy DUCHESS Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy Ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord That sets the word itself against the word Speak pardon as tis current in our land The chopping French we do not understand Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce Pity may move thee pardon to rehearse KING HENRY Good aunt stand up DUCHESS I do not sue to stand Pardon is all the suit I have in hand KING HENRY I pardon him as God shall pardon me DUCHESS O happy vantage of a kneeling knee Yet am I sick for fear Speak it again Twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain But makes one pardon strong KING HENRY With all my heart I pardon him DUCHESS A god on earth thou art KING HENRY But for our trusty brotherinlaw and the Abbot With all the rest of that consorted crew Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels Good uncle help to order several powers To Oxford or whereer these traitors

pray God make thee new Exeunt SCENE IV Another room in the Castle Enter Exton and a Servant EXTON Didst thou not mark the King what words he spake Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear Was it not so SERVANT These were his very words EXTON Have I no friend quoth he He spake it twice And urged it twice together did he not SERVANT He did EXTON And speaking it he wishtly looked on me As who should say I would thou wert the man That would divorce this terror from my heart Meaning the king at Pomfret Come lets go I am the Kings friend and will rid his foe Exeunt SCENE V Pomfret The dungeon of the Castle Enter Richard RICHARD I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I cannot do it Yet Ill hammer it out My brain Ill prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of stillbreeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermixed With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word as thus Come little ones And then again It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a needles eye Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortunes slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I kinged again and by and by Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing But whateer I be Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased With being nothing Music do I hear Music Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept So is it in the music of mens lives And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disordered string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numbring clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dials point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this allhating world Enter a Groom of the stable GROOM Hail royal Prince RICHARD Thanks noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear What art thou and how comest thou hither Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live GROOM I was a poor groom of thy stable king When thou wert king who travelling towards York With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal masters face O how it erned my heart when I beheld In London streets that coronation day When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary That horse that thou so often hast bestrid That horse that I so carefully have dressed RICHARD Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend How went he under him GROOM So proudly as if he disdained the ground RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he not stumble Would he not fall down Since pride must have a fall and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp his back Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee Since thou created to be awed by man Wast born to bear I was not made a horse And yet I bear a burden like an ass Spurred galled and tired"

be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesars to him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all free men As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate

come to bury Caesar not to praise him The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interred with their bones So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious If it were so it was a grievous fault And grievously hath Caesar answerd it Here under leave of Brutus and the rest For Brutus is an honourable man So are they all all honourable men Come I to speak in Caesars funeral He was my friend faithful and just to me But Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honourable man He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general

place ran Cassius dagger through See what a rent the envious Casca made Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabbd And as he pluckd his cursed steel away Mark how the blood of Caesar followd it As rushing out of doors to be resolvd If Brutus so unkindly knockd or no For Brutus as you know was Caesars angel Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar lovd him This was the most unkindest cut of all For when the noble Caesar saw him stab Ingratitude more strong than traitors arms Quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart And in his mantle muffling up his face Even at the base of Pompeys statue Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell O what a fall was there my countrymen Then I and you and all of us fell down Whilst bloody treason flourishd over us O now you weep and I perceive you

What shall I find you here OCTAVIUS Or here or at the Capitol Exit Lepidus ANTONY This is a slight unmeritable man Meet to be sent on errands Is it fit The threefold world divided he should stand One of the three to share it OCTAVIUS So you thought him And took his voice who should be prickd to die In our black sentence and proscription ANTONY Octavius I have seen more days than you And though we lay these honours on this man To ease ourselves of divers slandrous loads He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold To groan and sweat under the business Either led or driven as we point the way And having brought our treasure where we will Then take we down his load and turn him off Like to the empty ass to shake his ears And graze in commons OCTAVIUS You may do your will But hes a tried and valiant soldier ANTONY So is my horse Octavius and for that I do appoint him store of provender It is a creature that I teach to fight To wind to stop to run directly on His corporal motion governd by my spirit And in some taste is Lepidus but so He must be taught and traind and bid go forth A barrenspirited fellow one that feeds On objects arts and imitations Which out of use and stald by other men Begin his fashion Do not talk of him But as a property And now Octavius Listen great things Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers we must straight make head Therefore let our alliance be combind Our best friends made our means stretchd And let us presently go sit in council How covert matters may be best disclosd And open perils surest answered OCTAVIUS Let us do so for we are at the stake

do you salutation from his master Pindarus gives a letter to Brutus BRUTUS He greets me well Your master Pindarus In his own change or by ill officers Hath given me some worthy cause to wish Things done undone but if he be at hand I shall be satisfied PINDARUS I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is full of regard and honour BRUTUS He is not doubted A word Lucilius How he received you let me be resolvd LUCILIUS With courtesy and with respect enough But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath usd of old BRUTUS Thou hast describd A hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius When love begins to sicken and decay It useth an enforced ceremony There are no tricks in plain and simple faith But hollow men like horses hot at hand Make gallant show and promise of their mettle Low march within But when they should endure the bloody spur They fall their crests and like deceitful jades Sink in the trial Comes his army on LUCILIUS They meant this night in Sardis to be quarterd The greater part the horse in general Are come with Cassius Enter Cassius and Soldiers BRUTUS Hark he is arrivd March gently on to meet him CASSIUS Stand ho BRUTUS Stand ho Speak the word along FIRST SOLDIER Stand SECOND SOLDIER Stand THIRD SOLDIER Stand CASSIUS Most noble brother you have done me wrong BRUTUS Judge me you gods wrong I mine enemies And if not so how should I wrong a brother CASSIUS Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs And when you do them BRUTUS Cassius be content Speak your griefs softly I do know you well Before the eyes of both our armies here Which should perceive nothing but love from us Let us not wrangle Bid them move away Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs And I will give you audience CASSIUS Pindarus Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground BRUTUS Lucilius do you the like and let no man Come to our tent till we have done our conference Lucius and Titinius guard our doorExeunt SCENE III Within the tent of Brutus Enter Brutus and Cassius CASSIUS That you have wrongd me doth appear in this You have condemnd and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians Wherein my letters praying on his side Because I knew the man were slighted off BRUTUS You wrongd yourself to write in such a case CASSIUS In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offence should bear his comment BRUTUS Let me tell you Cassius you yourself Are much condemnd to have an itching palm To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers CASSIUS I an itching palm You know that you are Brutus that speak this Or by the gods this speech were else your last BRUTUS The name of Cassius honours this corruption And chastisement doth therefore hide his head CASSIUS Chastisement BRUTUS Remember March the Ides of March remember Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake What villain touchd his body that did stab And not for justice What Shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honours For so much trash as may be grasped thus I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman CASSIUS Brutus bait not me Ill not endure it You forget yourself To hedge me in I am a soldier I Older in practice abler than yourself To make conditions BRUTUS Go to you are not Cassius CASSIUS I am BRUTUS I say you are not CASSIUS Urge me no more I shall forget myself Have mind upon your health tempt me no farther BRUTUS Away slight man CASSIUS Ist possible BRUTUS Hear me for I will speak Must I give way and room to your rash choler Shall I be frighted when a madman stares CASSIUS O ye gods ye gods Must I endure all this BRUTUS All this ay more fret till your proud heart break Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble Must I budge Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humour By the gods You shall digest the venom of your spleen Though it do split you for from this day forth Ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter When you are waspish CASSIUS Is it come to this BRUTUS You say you are a better soldier Let it appear so make your vaunting true And it shall please me well For mine own part I shall be glad to learn of noble men CASSIUS You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus I said an elder soldier not a better Did I say better BRUTUS If you did I care not CASSIUS When Caesar livd he durst not thus have movd me BRUTUS Peace peace you durst not so have tempted him CASSIUS I durst not BRUTUS No CASSIUS What durst not tempt him BRUTUS For your life you durst not CASSIUS Do not presume too much upon my love I may do that I shall be sorry for BRUTUS You have done that you should be sorry for There is no terror Cassius in your threats For I am armd so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I respect not I did send to you For certain sums of gold which you denied me For I can raise no money by vile means By Heaven I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection I did send To you for gold to pay my legions Which you denied me was that done like Cassius Should I have answerd Caius Cassius so When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts Dash him to pieces CASSIUS I denied you not BRUTUS You did CASSIUS I did not He was but a fool That brought my answer back Brutus hath rivd my heart A friend should bear his friends infirmities But Brutus makes mine greater than they are BRUTUS I do not till you practise them on me CASSIUS You love me not BRUTUS I do not like your faults CASSIUS A friendly eye could never see such faults BRUTUS A flatterers would not though they do appear As huge as high Olympus CASSIUS Come Antony and young Octavius come Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius For Cassius is aweary of the world Hated by one he loves bravd by his brother Checkd like a bondman all his faults observd Set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote To cast into my teeth O I could weep My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger And here my naked breast within a heart Dearer than Plutus mine richer than gold If that thou best a Roman take it forth I that denied thee gold will give my heart Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius BRUTUS Sheathe your dagger Be angry when you will it shall have scope Do what you will dishonour shall be humour O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire Who much enforced shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again CASSIUS Hath Cassius livd To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him BRUTUS When I spoke that I was illtemperd too CASSIUS Do you confess so much Give me your hand BRUTUS And my heart too CASSIUS O Brutus BRUTUS Whats the matter CASSIUS Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humour which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful BRUTUS Yes Cassius and from henceforth When you are overearnest with your Brutus Hell think your mother chides and leave you so Enter Poet followed by Lucilius Titinius and Lucius POET Within Let me go in to see the generals There is some grudge between em tis not meet They be alone LUCILIUS Within You shall not come to them POET Within Nothing but death shall stay me CASSIUS How now Whats the matter POET For shame you generals What do you mean Love and be friends as two such men should be For I have seen more years Im sure than ye CASSIUS Ha ha How vilely doth this cynic rhyme BRUTUS Get you hence sirrah Saucy fellow hence CASSIUS Bear with him Brutus tis his fashion BRUTUS Ill know his humour when he knows his time What should the wars do with these jigging fools Companion hence CASSIUS Away away be gone Exit Poet BRUTUS Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight CASSIUS And come yourselves and bring Messala with you Immediately to us Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius BRUTUS Lucius a bowl of wine Exit Lucius CASSIUS I did not think you could have been so angry BRUTUS O Cassius I am sick of many griefs CASSIUS Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils BRUTUS No man bears sorrow better Portia is dead CASSIUS Ha Portia BRUTUS She is dead CASSIUS How scapd I killing when I crossd you so O insupportable and touching loss Upon what sickness BRUTUS Impatient of my absence And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong for with her death That tidings came With this she fell distract And her attendants absent swallowd fire CASSIUS And died so BRUTUS Even so CASSIUS O ye immortal gods Enter Lucius with wine and a taper BRUTUS Speak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine In this I bury all unkindness Cassius Drinks CASSIUS My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge Fill Lucius till the wine oerswell the cup I cannot drink too much of Brutus love Drinks Exit Lucius Enter Titinius and Messala BRUTUS Come in Titinius Welcome good Messala Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities CASSIUS Portia art thou gone BRUTUS No more I pray you Messala I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power Bending their expedition toward Philippi MESSALA Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor BRUTUS With what addition MESSALA That by proscription and bills of outlawry Octavius Antony and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred Senators BRUTUS Therein our letters do not well agree Mine speak of seventy Senators that died By their proscriptions Cicero being one CASSIUS Cicero one MESSALA Cicero is dead And by that order of proscription Had you your letters from your wife my lord BRUTUS No Messala MESSALA Nor nothing in your letters writ of her BRUTUS Nothing Messala MESSALA That methinks is strange BRUTUS Why ask you Hear you aught of

must die Messala With meditating that she must die once I have the patience to endure it now MESSALA Even so great men great losses should endure CASSIUS I have as much of this in art as you But yet my nature could not bear it so BRUTUS Well to our work alive What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently CASSIUS I do not think it good BRUTUS Your reason CASSIUS This it is Tis better that the enemy seek us So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers Doing himself offence whilst we lying still Are full of rest defence and nimbleness BRUTUS Good reasons must of force give place to better The people twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection For they have grudgd us contribution The enemy marching along by them By them shall make a fuller number up Come on refreshd newadded and encouragd From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there These people at our back CASSIUS Hear me good brother BRUTUS Under your pardon You must note besides That we have tried the utmost of our friends Our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe The enemy increaseth every day We at the height are ready to decline There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune Omitted all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries On such a full sea are we now afloat And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures CASSIUS Then with your will go on Well along ourselves and meet them at Philippi BRUTUS The deep of night is crept upon our talk And nature must obey necessity Which we will niggard with a little rest There is no more to say CASSIUS No more Good night Early tomorrow will we rise and hence Enter Lucius BRUTUS Lucius My gown Exit Lucius Farewell now good Messala Good

live I will be good to thee Lucius plays and sings till he falls asleep This is a sleepy tune O murdrous slumber Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music Gentle knave good night I

plains of Philippi Enter Octavius Antony and their Army OCTAVIUS Now Antony our hopes are answered You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions It proves not so their battles are at hand They mean to warn us at Philippi here Answering before we do demand of them ANTONY Tut I am in their bosoms and I know Wherefore they do it They could be content To visit other places and come down With fearful bravery thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage But tis not so Enter a Messenger MESSENGER Prepare you generals The enemy comes on in gallant show Their bloody sign of battle is hung out And something to be done immediately ANTONY Octavius lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even field OCTAVIUS Upon the right hand I

strokes Octavius ANTONY In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words Witness the hole you made in Caesars heart Crying Long live Hail Caesar CASSIUS Antony The posture of your blows are yet unknown But for your words they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless ANTONY Not stingless too BRUTUS O yes and soundless too For you have stoln their buzzing Antony And very wisely threat before you sting ANTONY Villains you did not so when your vile daggers Hackd one another in the sides of Caesar You showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds And bowd like bondmen kissing Caesars feet Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind Struck Caesar on the neck O you flatterers CASSIUS Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruld OCTAVIUS Come come the cause If arguing makes us sweat The proof of it will turn to redder drops Look I draw a sword against conspirators When think you that the sword goes up again Never till Caesars three"

a miserable night So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights That as I am a Christian faithful man I would not spend another such a night Though twere to buy a world of happy days So full of dismal terror was the time KEEPER What was your dream my lord I pray you tell me CLARENCE Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy And in my company my brother Gloucester Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand heavy times During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befalln us As we paced alongUpon the giddy footing of the hatches Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling Struck me that thought to stay him overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main O Lord methought what pain it was to drown What dreadful noise of waters in my ears What sights of ugly death within my eyes Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl Inestimable stones unvalued jewels All scattered in the bottom of the sea Some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept As twere in scorn of eyesreflecting gems That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by KEEPER Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon these secrets of the deep CLARENCE Methought I had and often did I strive To yield the ghost but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty vast and wandring air But smothered it within my panting bulk Who almost burst to belch it in the sea KEEPER Awaked you not in this sore agony CLARENCE No no my dream was lengthened after life O then began the tempest to my soul I passed methought the melancholy flood With that sour ferryman which poets write of Unto the kingdom of perpetual night The first that there did greet my strangersoul Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick Who spake aloud What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence And so he vanished Then came wandring by A shadow like an angel with bright hair Dabbled in blood and he shrieked out aloud Clarence is comefalse fleeting perjured Clarence That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury Seize on him Furies Take him unto torment With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends Environed me and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling waked and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell Such terrible impression made my dream KEEPER No marvel lord though it affrighted you I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it CLARENCE Ah Keeper Keeper I have done these things That now give evidence against my soul For Edwards sake and see how he requites me O God if my deep prayers cannot appease Thee But Thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children Keeper I prithee sit by me awhile My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep KEEPER I will my lord God give your Grace good rest Clarence reposes himself on a chair Enter Brakenbury the Lieutenant BRAKENBURY Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours Makes the night morning and the noontide night Princes have but their titles for their glories An outward honour for an inward toil And for unfelt imaginations They often feel a world of restless cares So that between their titles and low name Theres nothing differs but the outward fame Enter the two Murderers FIRST MURDERER Ho whos here BRAKENBURY What wouldst thou fellow And how camst thou hither SECOND MURDERER I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs BRAKENBURY What so brief FIRST MURDERER Tis better sir than to be tedious Let him see our commission and talk no more Brakenbury reads the commission BRAKENBURY I am in this commanded to deliver The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless of the meaning There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys Ill to the King and signify to him That thus I have resigned to you my charge FIRST MURDERER You may sir tis a point of wisdom Fare you well Exeunt Brakenbury and the Keeper SECOND MURDERER What shall I stab him as he sleeps FIRST MURDERER No Hell say twas done cowardly when he wakes SECOND MURDERER Why he shall never wake until the great Judgement Day FIRST MURDERER Why then hell say we stabbed him sleeping SECOND MURDERER The urging of that word judgement hath bred a kind of remorse in me FIRST MURDERER What art thou afraid SECOND MURDERER Not to kill him having a warrant but to be damned for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me FIRST MURDERER I thought thou hadst been resolute SECOND MURDERER So I amto let him live FIRST MURDERER Ill back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so SECOND MURDERER Nay I prithee stay a little I hope this passionate humour will change It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty FIRST MURDERER How dost thou feel thyself now SECOND MURDERER Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me FIRST MURDERER Remember our reward when the deeds done SECOND MURDERER Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward FIRST MURDERER Wheres thy conscience now SECOND MURDERER O in the Duke of Gloucesters purse FIRST MURDERER So when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out SECOND MURDERER Tis no matter let it go Theres few or none will entertain it FIRST MURDERER What if it come to thee again SECOND MURDERER Ill not meddle with it it makes a man coward A man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it detects him Tis a blushing shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom It fills a man full of obstacles It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found It beggars any man that keeps it It is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it FIRST MURDERER Zounds tis even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the Duke SECOND MURDERER Take the devil in thy mind and believe him not He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh FIRST MURDERER I am strongframed he cannot prevail with me SECOND

next room SECOND MURDERER O excellent deviceand make a sop of him FIRST MURDERER Soft he wakes SECOND MURDERER Strike FIRST MURDERER No well reason with him CLARENCE Where art thou keeper Give me a cup of wine SECOND MURDERER You shall have wine enough my lord anon CLARENCE In Gods name what art thou FIRST MURDERER A man as you are CLARENCE But not as I am royal SECOND MURDERER Nor you as we are loyal CLARENCE Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble FIRST MURDERER My voice is now the Kings my looks mine own CLARENCE How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak Your eyes do menace me why look you pale Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come SECOND MURDERER To to to CLARENCE To murder me BOTH MURDERERS Ay ay CLARENCE You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it Wherein my friends have I offended you FIRST MURDERER Offended us you have not but the King CLARENCE I shall be reconciled to him again SECOND MURDERER Never my lord therefore prepare to die CLARENCE Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent What is my offence Where is the evidence that doth accuse me What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death Before I be convict by course of law To threaten me with death is most unlawful I charge you as you hope to have redemption By Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins That you depart and lay no hands on me The deed you undertake is damnable FIRST MURDERER What we will do we do upon command SECOND MURDERER And he that hath commanded is our King CLARENCE Erroneous vassals The great King of kings Hath in the table of his law commanded That thou shalt do no murder Will you then Spurn at His edict and fulfil a mans Take heed for He holds vengeance in His hand To hurl upon their heads that break His law SECOND MURDERER And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight In quarrel of the house of Lancaster FIRST MURDERER And like a traitor to the name of God Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereigns son SECOND MURDERER Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend FIRST MURDERER How canst thou urge Gods dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree CLARENCE Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed For Edward for my brother for his sake He sends you not to murder me for this For in that sin he is as deep as I If God will be avenged for the deed O know you yet He doth it publicly Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him FIRST MURDERER Who made thee then a bloody minister When gallantspringing brave Plantagenet That princely novice was struck dead by thee CLARENCE My brothers love the devil and my rage FIRST MURDERER Thy brothers love our duty and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee CLARENCE If you do love my brother hate not me I am his brother and I love him well If you are hired for meed go back again And I will send you to my brother Gloucester Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death SECOND MURDERER You are deceived Your brother Gloucester hates you CLARENCE O no he loves me and he holds me dear Go you to him from me FIRST MURDERER Ay so we will CLARENCE Tell him when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm And charged us from his soul to love each other He little thought of this divided friendship Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep FIRST MURDERER Ay millstones as he lessoned us to weep CLARENCE O do not slander him for he is kind FIRST MURDERER Right as snow in harvest Come you deceive yourself Tis he that sends us to destroy you here CLARENCE It cannot be for he bewept my fortune And hugged me in his arms and swore with sobs That he would labour my delivery FIRST MURDERER Why so he doth when he delivers you From this earths thraldom to the joys of heaven SECOND MURDERER Make peace with God for you must die my lord CLARENCE Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God And are you yet to your own souls so blind That you will war with God by murdring me O sirs consider they that set you onTo do this deed will hate you for the deed SECOND MURDERER What shall we do CLARENCE Relent and save your souls FIRST MURDERER Relent No tis cowardly and womanish CLARENCE Not to relent is beastly savage devilish Which of youif you were a princes son Being pent from liberty as I am now If two such murderers as yourselves came to you Would not entreat for life Ay you would beg Were you

sayst charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit For my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid itEnter Oliver ADAM Yonder comes my master your brother ORLANDO Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up Adam retires OLIVER Now sir what make you here ORLANDO Nothing I am not taught to make anything OLIVER What mar you then sir ORLANDO Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a poor

come to such penury OLIVER Know you where you are sir ORLANDO O sir very well here in your orchard OLIVER Know you before whom sir ORLANDO Ay better than him I am before knows me I know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the firstborn but the same tradition takes not away my blood were

patient For your fathers remembrance be at accord OLIVER Let me go I say ORLANDO I will not till I please You shall hear me My father charged you in his will to give me good education You have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy my fortunes OLIVER And what wilt thou do Beg when that is spent Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled with you You shall have some part of your will I pray you leave me ORLANDO I no further offend you than becomes me for my good OLIVER Get you with him you old dog ADAM Is old dog my reward

put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander OLIVER Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter be banished with her father CHARLES O no for the Dukes daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do OLIVER Where will the old Duke live CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world OLIVER What you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for

AGAMEMNON Tis done like Hector ACHILLES But securely done A little proudly and great deal misprising The knight opposd AENEAS If not Achilles sir What is your name ACHILLES If not Achilles nothingAENEAS Therefore Achilles But whateer know this In the extremity of great and little Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector The one almost as infinite as all The other blank as nothing

tongue Not soon provokd nor being provokd soon calmd His heart and hand both open and both free For what he has he gives what thinks he shows Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath Manly as Hector but more dangerous For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love They call him Troilus and on him erect A second hope as fairly built as Hector Thus says Aeneas one that knows the youth Even to his inches and with private soul Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me Alarum Hector and Ajax fight AGAMEMNON They are in action NESTOR Now Ajax hold thine own TROILUS Hector thou sleepst awake thee AGAMEMNON His blows are well disposd There Ajax Trumpets cease

this is Trojan the sinews of this leg All Greek and this all Troy my mothers blood Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister Bounds in my fathers by Jove multipotent Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member Wherein my sword had not impressure made Of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay That any drop thou borrowdst from thy mother My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword Be drained Let me embrace thee Ajax By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms Hector would have them fall upon him thus Cousin all honour to thee AJAX I thank thee Hector Thou art too gentle and too free a man I

the heavens upon this holy act That afterhours with sorrow chide us not ROMEO Amen amen but come what sorrow can It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight Do thou but close our hands with holy words Then lovedevouring death do what he dare It is enough I may but call her mine FRIAR LAWRENCE These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die like fire and powder Which as they kiss consume The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite Therefore love moderately long love doth so Too

Why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter with another for tying his new shoes with an old riband And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling BENVOLIO And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an

into some house Benvolio Or I shall faint A plague o both your houses They have made worms meat of me I have it and soundly too Your houses Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio ROMEO This gentleman the

kinsman Prince as thou art true For blood of ours shed blood of Montague O cousin cousin PRINCE Benvolio who began this bloody fray BENVOLIO Tybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did slay Romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink How nice the quarrel was and urgd withal Your high displeasure All this uttered With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast Who all as hot turns deadly point to point And with a martial scorn with one hand beats Cold death aside and with the other sends It back to Tybalt whose dexterity Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud Hold friends Friends part and swifter than his tongue His agile arm beats down their fatal points And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled But by and by comes back to Romeo Who had but newly entertaind revenge And tot they go like lightning for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly This is the truth or let Benvolio die LADY CAPULET He is a kinsman to the Montague Affection makes him false he speaks not true Some twenty of them fought in this black strife And all those twenty could but kill one life I beg for justice which thou Prince must give Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live PRINCE Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe MONTAGUE Not Romeo Prince he was Mercutios friend His fault concludes but what the law should end The life of Tybalt PRINCE And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence I have an interest in your hates proceeding My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine I will be deaf to pleading and excuses Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses Therefore use none Let Romeo hence in haste

And pay no worship to the garish sun O I have bought the mansion of a love But not possessd it and though I am sold Not yet enjoyd So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an

mistaking offer up to joy My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain And Tybalts dead that would have slain my husband All this is comfort wherefore weep I then Some word there was worser than Tybalts death That murderd me I would forget it fain But O it presses to my memory Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished That banished that one word banished Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts death Was woe enough if it had ended there Or if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be rankd with other griefs Why followd not when she said Tybalts

Digressing from the valour of a man Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish Thy wit that ornament to shape and love Misshapen in the conduct of them both Like powder in a skilless soldiers flask Is set afire by thine own ignorance And thou dismemberd with thine own defence What rouse thee man Thy Juliet is alive For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee But thou slewst Tybalt there art thou happy The law that threatend death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile there art thou happy A pack of

HIPPOLYTA With much labour And I did love him for t They two have cabined In many as dangerous as poor a corner Peril and want contending they have skiffed Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power I th least of these was dreadful and they have Fought out together where Deaths self was lodged Yet fate hath brought them off Their knot of love Tied weaved entangled with so true so long And with a finger of so deep a cunning May be outworn never undone I think Theseus cannot be umpire to himself Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing Each side like justice which he loves best EMILIA Doubtless There is a best and reason has no manners To say it is not you I was acquainted Once with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow You were at wars when she the grave enriched Who made too proud

maturely seasoned More buckled with strong judgement and their needs The one of th other may be said to water Their intertangled roots of love but I And she I sigh and spoke of were things innocent Loved for we did and like the elements That know not what nor why yet do effect Rare issues by their operance our souls Did so to one another What she liked Was then of me approved what not condemned No more arraignment The flower that I would pluck And put between my breasts O then but beginning To swell about the blossomshe would long Till she had such another and commit it To the like innocent cradle where phnixlike They died in perfume On my head no toy But was her pattern her affectionspretty Though haply her careless wearI followed For my most serious decking had mine ear Stoln some new

thyself Than I will trust a sickly appetite That loathes even as it longs But sure my sister If I were ripe for your persuasion you Have said enough to shake me from the arm Of the allnoble Theseus

Jailer and Wooer JAILER I may depart with little while I live something I may cast to you not much Alas the prison I keep though it be for great ones yet they seldom come before one salmon you shall take a number of minnows I am given out to be better lined than it can appear to me report is a true speaker I would I were really that I am delivered to be Marry what I have be it what it will I will assure upon my daughter at the day of my death WOOER Sir I demand no more than your own offer and I will estate your daughter in what I have promised JAILER Well we will talk more of this when the solemnity is past But have you a full promise of her When that shall be seen I tender my consent Enter the Jailers Daughter carrying rushes WOOER I have sir Here she comes JAILER Your friend and I have chanced to name you here upon the old business But no more of that now so soon as the court hurry is over we will have an end of it I th meantime look tenderly to the two prisoners I can tell you they are princesDAUGHTER These strewings are for their chamber Tis pity they are in prison and twere pity they should be out I do think they have patience to make any adversity ashamed The prison itself is proud of em and they have all the world in their chamber JAILER They are famed to be a pair of absolute men DAUGHTER By my troth I think fame but stammers em they stand a grise above the reach of report JAILER I heard them reported in the battle to be the only doers DAUGHTER Nay most likely for they are noble sufferers I marvel how they would have looked had they been victors that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage making misery their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at JAILER Do they so DAUGHTER It seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of ruling Athens They eat well look merrily discourse of many things but nothing of their own restraint and disasters Yet sometime a divided sigh martyred as twere i th deliverance will break from one of themwhen the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid or at least a sigher to be comforted WOOER I never saw em JAILER The Duke himself came privately in the night and so did they Enter Palamon and Arcite above What the reason of it is I know not Look yonder they are thats Arcite looks out DAUGHTER No sir no thats Palamon Arcite is the lower of the twain you may perceive a part of him JAILER Go to leave your pointing they would not make us their object Out of their sight DAUGHTER It is a holiday to look on them Lord the difference of men Exeunt SCENE II The prison Enter Palamon and Arcite in prison PALAMON How do you noble cousin ARCITE How do you sir PALAMON Why strong enough to laugh at misery And bear the chance of war yet we are prisoners I fear for ever cousin ARCITE I believe it And to that destiny have patiently Laid up my hour to come PALAMON O cousin Arcite Where is Thebes now Where is our noble country Where are our friends and kindreds Never more Must we behold those comforts never see The hardy youths strive for the games of honour Hung with the painted favours of their ladies Like tall ships under sail then start amongst em And as an east wind leave em all behind us Like lazy clouds whilst Palamon and Arcite Even in the wagging of a wanton leg Outstripped the peoples praises won the garlands Ere they have time to wish em ours O never Shall we two exercise like twins of honour Our arms again and feel our fiery horses Like proud seas under us Our good swords now Better the redeyed god of war neer wore Ravished our sides like age must run to rust And deck the temples of those gods that hate us These hands shall never draw em out like lightning To blast whole armies more ARCITE No Palamon Those hopes are prisoners with us Here we are And here the graces of our youths must wither Like a tootimely spring here age must find us And which is heaviest Palamon unmarried The sweet embraces of a loving wife Loaden with kisses armed with thousand Cupids Shall never clasp our necks no issue know us No figures of ourselves shall we eer see To glad our age and like young eagles teach em Boldly to gaze against bright arms and say Remember what your fathers were and conquer The faireyed maids shall weep our banishments And in their songs curse everblinded Fortune Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done To youth and nature This is all our world We shall know nothing here but one another Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes The vine shall grow but we shall never see it Summer shall come and with her all delights But deadcold winter must inhabit here still PALAMON Tis too true Arcite To our Theban hounds That shook the aged forest with their echoes No more now must we hallow no more shake Our pointed javelins whilst the angry swine Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages Struck with our wellsteeled darts All valiant uses The food and nourishment of noble minds In us two here shall perish we shall die Which is the curse of honour lastly Children of grief and ignorance ARCITE Yet cousin Even from the bottom of these miseries From all that fortune can inflict upon us I see two comforts rising two mere blessings If the gods please to hold here a brave patience And the enjoying of our griefs together Whilst Palamon is with me let me perish If I think this our prison PALAMON Certainly Tis a main goodness cousin that our fortunes Were twined together tis most true two souls Put in two noble bodies let em suffer The gall of hazard so they grow together Will never sink they must not say they could A willing man dies sleeping and alls done ARCITE Shall we make worthy uses of this place That all men hate so much PALAMON How gentle cousin ARCITE Lets think this prison holy sanctuary To keep us from corruption of worse men We are young and yet desire the ways of honour That liberty and common conversation The poison of pure spirits might like women Woo us to wander from What worthy blessing Can be but our imaginations May make it ours And here being thus together We are an endless mine to one another We are one anothers wife ever begetting New births of love we are father friends acquaintance We are in one another families I am your heir and you are mine This place Is our inheritance no hard oppressor Dare take this from us here with a little patience We shall live long and loving No surfeits seek us The hand of war hurts none here nor the seas Swallow their youth Were we at liberty A wife might part us lawfully or business Quarrels consume us envy of ill men Crave our acquaintance I might sicken cousin Where you should never know it and so perish Without your noble hand to close mine eyes Or prayers to the gods A thousand chances Were we from hence would sever us PALAMON You have made me I thank you cousin Arcitealmost wanton With my captivity What a misery It is to live abroad and everywhere Tis like a beast methinks I find the court here I am sure a more content and all those pleasures That woo the wills of men to vanity I see through now and am sufficient To tell the world tis but a gaudy shadow That old Time as he passes by takes with him What had we been old in the court of Creon Where sin is justice lust and ignorance The virtues of the great ones Cousin Arcite Had not the loving gods found this place for us We had died as they do ill old men unwept And had their epitaphs the peoples curses Shall I say more ARCITE I would hear you still PALAMON Ye shall Is there record of any two that loved Better than we do Arcite ARCITE Sure there cannot PALAMON I do not think it possible our friendship Should ever leave us ARCITE Till our deaths it cannot Enter Emilia and her Woman

is a goddess Arcite EMILIA Of all flowers Methinks a rose is best WOMAN Why gentle madam EMILIA It is the very emblem of a maid For when the west wind courts her gently How modestly she blows and paints the sun With her chaste blushes When the north comes near her Rude and impatient then like chastity She locks her beauties in her bud again And leaves him to base briers WOMAN Yet good madam Sometimes her modesty will blow so far She falls for t A maid If she have any honour would be loath To take example by her EMILIA Thou art wanton ARCITE She is wondrous fair PALAMON She is all the beauty extant EMILIA The sun grows high lets walk in Keep these flowers Well see how near art can come near their colours I am wondrous merryhearted I could laugh now WOMAN I could lie down I am sure EMILIA And take one with you WOMAN Thats as we bargain madam EMILIA Well agree then Exeunt Emilia and Woman PALAMON What think you of this beauty ARCITE Tis a rare one PALAMON Ist but a rare one

shall deny me PALAMON I that first saw her I that took possession First with mine eye of all those beauties in her Revealed to mankind If thou lovest her Or entertainst a hope to blast my wishes Thou art a traitor Arcite and a fellow False as thy title to her Friendship blood And all the ties between us I disclaim If thou once think upon her ARCITE Yes I love her And if the lives of all my name lay on it I must do so I love her with my soul If that will lose ye farewell Palamon I say again I love and in loving her maintain I am as worthy and as free a lover And have as just a title to her beauty As any Palamon or any living That is a mans son PALAMON Have I called thee friend ARCITE Yes and have found me so Why are you moved thus Let me deal coldly with you am not I Part of your blood part of your soul You have told me That I was Palamon and you were Arcite PALAMON Yes ARCITE Am not I liable to those affections Those joys griefs angers fears my friend shall suffer PALAMON Ye may be ARCITE Why then would you deal so cunningly So strangely so unlike a noble kinsmanTo love alone Speak truly do you think me Unworthy of her sight PALAMON No but unjust If thou pursue that sight ARCITE Because another First sees the enemy shall I stand still And let mine honour down and never charge PALAMON Yes if he be but one ARCITE But say that one Had rather combat me PALAMON Let that one say so And use thy freedom Else if thou pursuest her Be as that cursed man that hates his country A branded villain ARCITE You are mad PALAMON I must be Till thou art worthy Arcite it concerns me And in this madness if I hazard thee And take thy life I deal but truely ARCITE Fie sir You play the child extremely I will love her I must I ought to do so and I dare And all this justly PALAMON O that now that now Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune To be one hour at liberty and grasp Our good swords in our hands I would quickly teach thee What twere to filch affection from another Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse Put but thy head out of this window more And as I have a soul Ill nail thy life to t ARCITE Thou darst not fool thou canst not thou art feeble Put my head out Ill throw my body out And leap the garden when I see her next And pitch between her arms to anger thee Enter Jailer PALAMON No more the keepers coming I shall live To knock thy brains out with my shackles ARCITE Do JAILER By your leave gentlemen PALAMON Now honest keeper JAILER Lord Arcite you must presently to th Duke The cause I know not yet ARCITE I am ready keeper JAILER Prince Palamon I must awhile bereave you Of your fair cousins company Exeunt Arcite and Jailer PALAMON And me too Even when you please of lifeWhy is he sent for It may be he shall marry her hes goodly And like enough the Duke hath taken notice Both of his blood and body But his falsehood Why should a friend be treacherous If that Get him a wife so noble and so fair Let honest men neer love again Once more I would but see this fair one Blessed garden And fruit and flowers more blessed that still blossom As her bright eyes shine on ye Would I were For all the fortune of my life hereafter Yon little tree yon blooming apricock How I would spread and fling my wanton arms In at her window I would bring her fruit Fit for the gods to feed on youth and pleasure Still as she tasted should be doubled on her And if she be not heavenly I would make her So near the gods in nature they should fear her Enter Jailer And then I am sure she would love me How now keeper Wheres Arcite JAILER Banished Prince Pirithous Obtained

then pray you tell me If I should swear by Joves great attributesI lovd you dearly would you believe my oaths When I did love you ill This has no holding To swear by him whom I protest to love That I will work against him Therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions but unseald At least in my opinion BERTRAM Change it change it Be not so holycruel Love is holy And my integrity neer knew the crafts That you do charge men with Stand no more off But give thyself unto my sick desires Who then recovers Say thou art mine and ever My love as it begins shall so persever DIANA I see that men make

oaths He had sworn to marry me When his wifes dead therefore Ill lie with him When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid Marry that will I live and die a maid Only in this disguise I thinkt no sin

since fled from his house Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heaven SECOND LORD How is this justified FIRST LORD The stronger part of it by her own letters which makes

fright her with confusion of their cries She much amazed breaks ope her lockedup eyes Who peeping forth this tumult to behold Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled Imagine her as one in dead of night From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite Whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking What terror tis but she in worser taking From sleep disturbed heedfully doth view The sight which makes supposed terror true Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears Like to a newkilled bird she trembling lies She dares not look yet winking there appears Quickshifting antics ugly in her eyes Such shadows are the weak brains forgeries Who angry that the eyes fly from their lights In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights His hand that yet remains upon her breast Rude ram to batter such an ivory wall May feel her heart poor citizen distressed Wounding itself to death rise up and fall Beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal This moves in him more rage and lesser pity To make the breach and enter this sweet city First like a trumpet doth his tongue begin To sound a parley to his heartless foe Who oer the white sheet peers her whiter chin The reason of this rash alarm to know Which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show But she with vehement prayers urgeth still Under what colour he commits this ill Thus he replies The colour in thy face That even for anger makes the lily pale And the red rose blush at her own disgrace Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale Under that colour am I come to scale Thy neverconquered fort the fault is thine For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine Thus I forestall thee if thou mean to chide Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night Where thou with patience must my will abide My will that marks thee for my earths delight Which I to conquer sought with all my might But as reproof and reason beat it dead By thy bright beauty was it newly bred I see what crosses my attempt will bring I know what thorns the growing rose defends I think the honey guarded with a sting All this beforehand counsel comprehends But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty And dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty I have debated even in my soul What wrong what shame what sorrow I shall breed But nothing can affections course control Or stop the headlong fury of his speed I know repentant tears ensue the deed Reproach disdain and deadly enmity Yet strike I to embrace mine infamy This said he shakes aloft his Roman blade Which like a falcon towring in the skies Coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies So under his insulting falchion lies Harmless Lucretia marking what he tells With trembling fear as fowl hear falcons bells Lucrece quoth he this night I must enjoy thee If thou deny then force must work my way For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee That done some worthless slave of thine Ill slay To kill thine honour with thy lifes decay And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him Swearing I slew him seeing thee embrace him So thy surviving husband shall remain The scornful mark of every open eye Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain Thy issue blurred with nameless bastardy And thou the author of their obloquy Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes And sung by children in succeeding times But if thou yield I rest thy secret friend The fault unknown is as a thought unacted A little harm done to a great good end For lawful policy remains enacted The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted In a pure compound being so applied His venom in effect is purified Then for thy husband and thy childrens sake Tender my suit Bequeath not to their lot The shame that from them no device can take The blemish that will never be forgot Worse than a slavish wipe or birthhours blot For marks descried in mens nativity Are natures faults not their own infamy Here with a cockatrice deadkilling eye He rouseth up himself and makes a pause While she the picture of pure piety Like a white hind under the gripes sharp claws Pleads in a wilderness where are no laws To the rough beast that knows no gentle right Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite But when a blackfaced cloud the world doth threat In his dim mist th aspiring mountains hiding From earths dark womb some gentle gust doth get Which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding Hindring their present fall by this dividing So his unhallowed haste her words delays And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays Yet foul nightwaking cat he doth but dally While in his holdfast foot the weak mouse panteth Her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth His ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth No penetrable entrance to her plaining Tears harden lust though marble wear with raining Her pitypleading eyes are sadly fixed In the remorseless wrinkles of his face Her modest eloquence with sighs is mixed Which to her oratory adds more grace She puts the period often from his place And midst the sentence so her accent breaks That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks She conjures him by high almighty Jove By knighthood gentry and sweet friendships oath By her untimely tears her husbands love By holy human law and common troth By heaven and earth and all the power of both That to his borrowed bed he make retire And stoop to honour not to foul desireQuoth she Reward not hospitality With such black payment as thou hast pretended Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee Mar not the thing that cannot be amended End thy ill aim before the shoot be ended He is no woodman that doth bend his bow To strike a poor unseasonable doe My husband is thy friend for his sake spare me Thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me Myself a weakling do not then ensnare me Thou lookst not like deceit do not deceive me My sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee If ever man were moved with womans moans Be moved with my tears my sighs my groans All which together like a troubled ocean Beat at thy rocky and wrackthreatning heart To soften it with their continual motion For stones dissolved to water do convert O if no harder than a stone thou art Melt at my tears and be compassionate Soft pity enters at an iron gate In Tarquins likeness I did entertain thee Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame To all the host of heaven I complain me Thou wrongst his honour woundst his princely name Thou art not what thou seemst and if the same Thou seemst not what thou art a god a king For kings like gods should govern everything How will thy shame be seeded in thine age When thus thy vices bud before thy spring If in thy hope thou darst do such outrage What darst thou not when once thou art a king O be remembered no outrageous thing From vassal actors can be wiped away Then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay This deed will make thee only loved for fear But happy monarchs still are feared for love With foul offenders thou perforce must bear When they in thee the like offences prove If but for fear of this thy will remove For princes are the glass the school the book Where subjects eyes do learn do read do look And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn Must he in thee read lectures of such shame Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern Authority for sin warrant for blame To privilege dishonour in thy name Thou backst reproach against longliving laud And makst fair reputation but a bawd Hast thou command By him that gave it thee From a pure heart command thy rebel will Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity For it was lent thee all that brood to kill Thy princely office how canst thou fulfill When patterned by thy fault foul Sin may say He learned to sin and thou didst teach the way Think but how vile a spectacle it were To view thy present trespass in another Mens faults do seldom to themselves appear Their own transgressions partially they smother This guilt would seem deathworthy in thy brother O how are they wrapped in with infamies That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes To thee to thee my heavedup hands appeal Not to seducing lust thy rash relier I sue for exiled majestys repeal Let him return and flattring thoughts retire His true respect will prison false desire And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine Have done quoth he My uncontrolled tide Turns not but swells the higher by this let Small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide And with the wind in greater fury fret The petty streams that pay a daily debt To their salt sovereign with their fresh falls haste Add to his flow but alter not his taste Thou art quoth she a sea a sovereign king And lo there falls into thy boundless flood Black lust dishonour shame misgoverning Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood If all these petty ills shall change thy good Thy sea within a puddles womb is hearsed And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed So shall these slaves be king and thou their slave Thou nobly base they basely dignified Thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave Thou loathed in their shame they in thy pride The lesser thing should not the greater hide The cedar stoops not to the base shrubs foot But low shrubs wither at the cedars root So let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state No more quoth he by heaven I will not hear thee Yield to my love If not enforced hate Instead of loves coy touch shall rudely tear thee That done despitefully I mean to bear thee Unto the base bed of some rascal groom To be thy partner in this shameful doom This said he sets his foot upon the light For light and lust are deadly enemies Shame folded up in blind concealing night When most unseen then most doth tyrannize The wolf hath seized his prey the poor lamb cries Till with her own white fleece her voice controlled Entombs her outcry in her lips sweet fold For with the nightly linen that she wears He pens her piteous clamours in her head Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed O that prone lust should stain so pure a bed The spots whereof could weeping purify Her tears should drop on them perpetually But she hath lost a dearer thing than life And he hath won what he would lose again This forced league doth force a further strife This momentary joy breeds months of pain This hot desire converts to cold disdain Pure Chastity is rifled of her store And Lust the thief far poorer than before Look as the fullfed hound or gorged hawk Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight Make slow pursuit or altogether balk The prey wherein by nature they delight So surfeittaking Tarquin fares this night His taste delicious in digestion souring Devours his will that lived by foul devouring O deeper sin than bottomless conceit Can comprehend in still imagination Drunken desire must vomit his receipt Ere he can see his own abomination While lust is in his pride no exclamation Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire Till like a jade selfwill himself doth tire And then with lank and lean discoloured cheek With heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace Feeble desire all recreant poor and meek Like to a bankrout beggar wails his case The flesh being proud desire doth fight with Grace For there it revels and when that decays The guilty rebel for remission prays So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome Who this accomplishment so hotly chased For now against himself he sounds this doom That through the length of times he stands disgraced Besides his souls fair temple is defaced To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares To ask the spotted princess how she fares She says her subjects with foul insurrection Have battered down her consecrated wall And by their mortal fault brought in subjection Her immortality and made her thrall To living death and pain perpetual Which in her prescience she controlled still But her foresight could not forestall their will Een in this thought through the dark night he stealeth A captive victor that hath lost in gain Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth The scar that will despite of cure remain Leaving his spoil perplexed in greater pain She bears the load of lust he left behind And he the burden of a guilty mind He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence She like a wearied lamb lies panting there He scowls and hates himself for his offence She desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear He faintly flies sweating with guilty fear She stays exclaiming on the direful night He runs and chides his vanished loathed delight He thence departs a heavy convertite She there remains a hopeless castaway He in his speed looks for the morning light She prays she never may behold the day For day quoth she nights scapes doth open lay And my true eyes have never practised how To cloak offences with a cunning brow They think not but that every eye can see The same disgrace which they themselves behold And therefore would they still in darkness be To have their unseen sin remain untold For they their guilt with weeping will unfold And grave like water that doth eat in steel Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel Here she exclaims against repose and rest And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind She wakes her heart by beating on her breast And bids it leap from thence where it may find Some purer chest to close so pure a mind Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite Against the unseen secrecy of night O comfortkilling night image of hell Dim register and notary of shame Black stage for tragedies and murders fell Vast sinconcealing chaos nurse of blame Blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame Grim cave of death whispring conspirator With closetongued treason and the ravisher O hateful vaporous and foggy night Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light Make war against proportioned course of time Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb His wonted height yet ere he go to bed Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head With rotten damps ravish the morning air Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick The life of purity the supreme fair Ere he arrive his weary noontide prick And let thy misty vapours march so thick That in their smoky ranks his smothered light May set at noon and make perpetual night Were Tarquin night as he is but nights child The silvershining queen he would distain Her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled Through Nights black bosom should not peep again So should I have copartners in my pain And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage As palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage Where now I have no one to blush with me To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine To mask their brows and hide their infamy But I alone alone must sit and pine Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine Mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans O night thou furnace of foul reeking smoke Let not the jealous day behold that face Which underneath thy black allhiding cloak Immodesty lies martyred with disgrace Keep still possession of thy gloomy place That all the faults which in thy reign are made May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade Make me not object to the telltale day The light will show charactered in my brow The story of sweet chastitys decay The impious breach of holy wedlock vow Yea the illiterate that know not how To cipher what is writ in learned books Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks The nurse to still her child will tell my story And fright her crying babe with Tarquins name The orator to deck his oratory Will couple my reproach to Tarquins shameFeastfinding minstrels tuning my defame Will tie the hearers to attend each line How Tarquin wronged me I Collatine Let my good name that senseless reputation For Collatines dear love be kept unspotted If that be made a theme for disputation The branches of another root are rotted And undeserved reproach to him allotted That is as clear from this attaint of mine As I ere this was pure to Collatine O unseen shame invisible disgrace O unfelt sore crestwounding private scar Reproach is stamped in Collatinus face And Tarquins eye may read the mot afar How he in peace is wounded not in war Alas how many bear such shameful blows Which not themselves but he that gives them knows If Collatine thine honour lay in me From me by strong assault it is bereft My honey lost and I a dronelike bee Have no perfection of my summer left But robbed and ransacked by injurious theft In thy weak hive a wandring wasp hath crept And sucked the honey which thy chaste bee kept Yet am I guilty of thy honours wrack Yet for thy honour did I entertain him Coming from thee I could not put him back For it had been dishonour to disdain him Besides of weariness he did complain him And talked of virtue O unlookedfor evil When virtue is profaned in such a devil Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts Or kings be breakers of their own behests But no perfection is so absolute That some impurity doth not pollute The aged man that coffers up his gold Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold But like stillpining Tantalus he sits And useless barns the harvest of his wits Having no other pleasure of his gain But torment that it cannot cure his pain So then he hath it when he cannot use it And leaves it to be mastered by his young Who in their pride do presently abuse it Their father was too weak and they too strong To hold their cursedblessed fortune long The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours Even in the moment that we call them ours Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing What virtue breeds iniquity devours We have no good that we can say is ours But illannexed Opportunity Or kills his life or else his quality O Opportunity thy guilt is great Tis thou that executst the traitors treason Thou sets the wolf where he the lamb may get Whoever plots the sin thou pointst the season Tis thou that spurnst at right at law at reason And in thy shady cell where none may spy him Sits Sin to seize the souls that wander by him Thou makst the vestal violate her oath Thou blowst the fire when temperance is thawed Thou smotherst honesty thou murderst troth Thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud Thou ravisher thou traitor thou false thief Thy honey turns to gall thy joy to grief Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame Thy private feasting to a public fast Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name Thy sugared tongue to bitter wormwood taste Thy violent vanities can never last How comes it then vile Opportunity Being so bad such numbers seek for thee When wilt thou be the humble suppliants friend And bring him where his suit may be obtained When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chained Give physic to the sick ease to the pained The poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee But they neer meet with Opportunity The patient dies while the physician sleeps The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds Justice is feasting while the widow weeps Advice is sporting while infection breeds Thou grantst no time for charitable deeds Wrath envy treason rape and murders rages Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages When truth and virtue have to do with thee A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid They buy thy help but Sin neer gives a fee He gratis comes and thou art well appaid As well to hear as grant what he hath said My Collatine would else have come to me When Tarquin did but he was stayed by thee Guilty thou art of murder and of theft Guilty of perjury and subornation Guilty of treason forgery and shift Guilty of incest that abomination An accessory by thine inclination To all sins past and all that are to come From the creation to the general doom Misshapen Time copesmate of ugly night Swift subtle post carrier of grisly care Eater of youth false slave to false delight Base watch of woes sins packhorse virtues snare Thou nursest all and murdrest all that are O hear me then injurious shifting Time Be guilty of my death since of my crime Why hath thy servant Opportunity Betrayed the hours thou gavst me to repose Cancelled my fortunes and enchained me To endless date of neverending woes Times office is to fine the hate of foes To eat up errors by opinion bred Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed Times glory is to calm contending kings To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light To stamp the seal of time in aged things To wake the morn and sentinel the night To wrong the wronger till he render right To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours And smear with dust their glittring golden towers To fill with wormholes stately monuments To feed oblivion with decay of things To blot old books and alter their contents To pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings To dry the old oaks sap and cherish springs To spoil antiquities of hammered steel And turn the giddy round of Fortunes wheel To show the beldam daughters of her daughter To make the child a man the man a child To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter To tame the unicorn and lion wild To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops And waste huge stones with little waterdrops Why workst thou mischief in thy pilgrimage Unless thou couldst return to make amends One poor retiring minute in an age Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends O this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight Devise extremes beyond extremity To make him curse this cursed crimeful night Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright And the dire thought of his committed evil Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans Let there bechance him pitiful mischances To make him moan but pity not his moans Stone him with hardned hearts harder than stones And let mild women to him lose their mildness Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness Let him have time to tear his curled hair Let him have time against himself to rave Let him have time of Times help to despair Let him have time to live a loathed slave Let him have time a beggars orts to crave And time to see one that by alms doth live Disdain to him disdained scraps to give Let him have time to see his friends his foes And merry fools to mock at him resort Let him have time to mark how slow time goes In time of sorrow and how swift and short His time of folly and his time of sport And ever let his unrecalling crime Have time to wail th abusing of his time O Time thou tutor both to good and bad Teach me to curse him that thou taughtst this ill At his own shadow let the thief run mad Himself himself seek every hour to kill Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill For who so base would such an office have As slandrous deathsman to so base a slave The baser is he coming from a king To shame his hope with deeds degenerate The mightier man the mightier is the thing That makes him honoured or begets him hate For greatest scandal waits on greatest state The moon being clouded presently is missed But little stars may hide them when they list The crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire And unperceived fly with the filth away But if the like the snowwhite swan desire The stain upon his silver down will stay Poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day Gnats are unnoted wheresoeer they fly But eagles gazed upon with every eye Out idle words servants to shallow fools Unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators Busy yourselves in skillcontending schools Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters To trembling clients be you mediators For me I force not argument a straw Since that my case is past the help of law In vain I rail at Opportunity At Time at Tarquin and uncheerful night In vain I cavil with mine infamy In vain I spurn at my confirmed despite This helpless smoke of words doth me no right The remedy indeed to do me good Is to let forth my foul defiled blood Poor hand why quiverst thou at this decree Honour thyself to rid me of this shame For if I die my honour lives in thee But if I live thou livst in my defame Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame And wast afeared to scratch her wicked foe Kill both thyself and her for yielding so This said from her betumbled couch she starteth To find some desprate instrument of death But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth To make more vent for passage of her breath Which thronging through her lips so vanisheth As smoke from tna that in air consumes Or that which from discharged cannon fumes In vain quoth she I live and seek in vain Some happy mean to end a hapless life I feared by Tarquins falchion to be slain Yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife But when I feared I was a loyal wife So am I nowO no that cannot be Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me O that is gone for which I sought to live And therefore now I need not fear to die To clear this spot by death at least I give A badge of fame to slanders livery A dying life to living infamy Poor helpless help the treasure stoln away To burn the guiltless casket where it lay Well well dear Collatine thou shalt not know The stained taste of violated troth I will not wrong thy true affection so To flatter thee with an infringed oath This bastard graff shall never come to growth He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute That thou art doting father of his fruit Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thoughtNor laugh with his companions at thy state But thou shalt know thy intrest was not bought Basely with gold but stoln from forth thy gate For me I am the mistress of my fate And with my trespass never will dispense Till life to death acquit my forced offence I will not poison thee with my attaint Nor fold my fault in cleanlycoined excuses My sable ground of sin I will not paint To hide the truth of this false nights abuses My tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices As from a mountainspring that feeds a dale Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale By this lamenting Philomel had ended The welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow And solemn night with slow sad gait descended To ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see And therefore still in night would cloistered be Revealing day through every cranny spies And seems to point her out where she sits weeping To whom she sobbing speaks O eye of eyes Why pryst thou through my window Leave thy peeping Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light For day hath naught to do whats done by night Thus cavils she with everything she sees True grief is fond and testy as a child Who wayward once his mood with naught agrees Old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild Continuance tames the one the other wild Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still With too much labour drowns for want of skill So she deepdrenched in a sea of care Holds disputation with each thing she views And to herself all sorrow doth compare No object but her passions strength renews And as one shifts another straight ensues Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words Sometime tis mad and too much talk affords The little birds that tune their mornings joy Make her moans mad with their sweet melody For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy Sad souls are slain in merry company Grief best is pleased with griefs society True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed When with like semblance it is sympathized Tis double death to drown in ken of shore He ten times pines that pines beholding food To see the salve doth make the wound ache more Great grief grieves most at that would do it good Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood Who being stopped the bounding banks oerflows Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows You mocking birds quoth she your tunes entomb Within your hollowswelling feathered breasts And in my hearing be you mute and dumb My restless discord loves no stops nor rests A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears Come Philomel that singst of ravishment Make thy sad grove in my disheveled hair As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment So I at each sad strain will strain a tear And with deep groans the diapason bear For burdenwise Ill hum on Tarquin still While thou on Tereus descants better skill And whiles against a thorn thou bearst thy part To keep thy sharp woes waking wretched I To imitate thee well against my heart Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye Who if it wink shall thereon fall and die These means as frets upon an instrument Shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment And for poor bird thou singst not in the day As shaming any eye should thee behold Some dark deep desert seated from the way That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold Will we find out and there we will unfold To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds Since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze Wildly determining which way to fly Or one encompassed with a winding maze That cannot tread the way out readily So with herself is she in mutiny To live or die which of the twain were better When life is shamed and Death reproachs debtor To kill myself quoth she alack what were it But with my body my poor souls pollution They that lose half with greater patience bear it Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion That mother tries a merciless conclusion Who having two sweet babes when death takes one Will slay the other and be nurse to none My body or my soul which was the dearer When the one pure the other made divine Whose love of either to myself was nearer When both were kept for heaven and Collatine Ay me the bark pilled from the lofty pine His leaves will wither and his sap decay So must my soul her bark being pilled away Her house is sacked her quiet interrupted Her mansion battered by the enemy Her sacred temple spotted spoiled corrupted Grossly engirt with daring infamy Then let it not be called impiety If in this blemished fort I make some hole Through which I may convey this troubled soul Yet die I will not till my Collatine Have heard the cause of my untimely death That he may vow in that sad hour of mine Revenge on him that made me stop my breath My stained blood to Tarquin Ill bequeath Which by him tainted shall for him be spent And as his due writ in my testament My honour Ill bequeath unto the knife That wounds my body so dishonoured Tis honour to deprive dishonoured life The one will live the other being dead So of shames ashes shall my fame be bred For in my death I murder shameful scorn My shame so dead mine honour is new born Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost What legacy shall I bequeath to thee My resolution love shall be thy boast By whose example thou revenged mayst be How Tarquin must be used read it in me Myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so This brief abridgement of my will I make My soul and body to the skies and ground My resolution husband do thou take Mine honour be the knifes that makes my wound My shame be his that did my fame confound And all my fame that lives disbursed be To those that live and think no shame of me Thou Collatine shalt oversee this will How was I overseen that thou shalt see it My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill My lifes foul deed my lifes fair end shall free it Faint not faint heart but stoutly say So be it Yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee Thou dead both die and both shall victors be This plot of death when sadly she had laid And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes With untuned tongue she hoarsely called her maid Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies For fleetwinged duty with thoughts feathers flies Poor Lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow Her mistress she doth give demure goodmorrow With soft slow tongue true mark of modesty And sorts a sad look to her ladys sorrow For why her face wore sorrows livery But durst not ask of her audaciously Why her two suns were cloudeclipsed so Nor why her fair cheeks overwashed with woe But as the earth doth weep the sun being set Each flower moistened like a melting eye Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet Her circled eyne enforced by sympathy Of those fair suns set in her mistress sky Who in a saltwaved ocean quench their light Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night A pretty while these pretty creatures stand Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling One justly weeps the other takes in hand No cause but company of her drops spilling Their gentle sex to weep are often willing Grieving themselves to guess at others smarts And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts For men have marble women waxen minds And therefore are they formed as marble will The weak oppressed th impression of strange kinds Is formed in them by force by fraud or skill Then call them not the authors of their ill No more than wax shall be accounted evil Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil Their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain Lays open all the little worms that creep In men as in a roughgrown grove remain Cavekeeping evils that obscurely sleep Through crystal walls each little mote will peep Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks Poor womens faces are their own faults books No man inveigh against the withered flower But chide rough winter that the flower hath killed Not that devoured but that which doth devour Is worthy blame O let it not be hild Poor womens faults that they are so fulfilled With mens abuses Those proud lords to blame Make weakmade women tenants to their shame The precedent whereof in Lucrece view Assailed by night with circumstances strong Of present death and shame that might ensue By that her death to do her husband wrong Such danger to resistance did belong The dying fear through all her body spread And who cannot abuse a body dead By this mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak To the poor counterfeit of her complaining My girl quoth she on what occasion break Those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining Know gentle wench it small avails my mood If tears could help mine own would do me good But tell me girl when wentand there she stayed Till after a deep groanTarquin from hence Madam ere I was up replied the maid The more to blame my sluggard negligence Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense Myself was stirring ere the break of day And ere I rose was Tarquin gone away But lady if your maid may be so bold She would request to know your heaviness O peace quoth Lucrece If it should be told The repetition cannot make it less For more it is than I can well express And that deep torture may be called a hell When more is felt than one hath power to tell Go get me hither paper ink and pen Yet save that labour for I have them here What should I sayOne of my husbands men Bid thou be ready by and by to bear A letter to my lord my love my dear Bid him with speed prepare to carry it The cause craves haste and it will soon be writ Her maid is gone and she prepares to write First hovering oer the paper with her quill Conceit and grief an eager combat fight What wit sets down is blotted straight with will This is too curiousgood this blunt and ill Much like a press of people at a door Throng her inventions which shall go before At last she thus begins Thou worthy lord Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee Health to thy person Next vouchsafe t affordIf ever love thy Lucrece thou wilt see Some present speed to come and visit me So I commend me from our house in grief My woes are tedious though my words are brief Here folds she up the tenor of her woe Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly By this short schedule Collatine may know Her grief but not her griefs true quality She dares not thereof make discovery Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse Besides the life and feeling of her passion She hoards to spend when he is by to hear her When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion Of her disgrace the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the world might bear her To shun this blot she would not blot the letter With words till action might become them better To see sad sights moves more than hear them told For then the eye interprets to the ear The heavy motion that it doth behold When every part a part of woe doth bear Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords And sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words Her letter now is sealed and on it writ At Ardea to my lord with more than haste The post attends and she delivers it Charging the sourfaced groom to hie as fast As lagging fowls before the northern blast Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems Extremely still urgeth such extremes The homely villain curtsies to her low And blushing on her with a steadfast eye Receives the scroll without or yea or no And forth with bashful innocence doth hie But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie Imagine every eye beholds their blame For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame

Bohemia A Room in the palace of Polixenes Enter Polixenes and Camillo POLIXENES I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate tis a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this CAMILLO It is fifteen years since I saw my country Though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I oerween to think sowhich is another spur to my departure POLIXENES As thou lovst me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee Thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callst him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues CAMILLO Sir it is three days since I saw the prince What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared POLIXENES I have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate CAMILLO I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage POLIXENES Thats likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither Prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia

begin to peer With hey the doxy over the dale Why then comes in the sweet o the year For the red blood reigns in the winters pale The white sheet bleaching on the hedge With hey the sweet birds O how they sing Doth set my pugging tooth on edge For a quart of ale is a dish for a king The lark that tirralirra chants With hey with hey the thrush and the jay Are summer songs for me and my aunts While we lie tumbling in the hay I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore threepile but now I am out of service But shall I go mourn for that my dear The pale moon shines by night And when I wander

fellow was he that robbed you AUTOLYCUS A fellow sir that I have known to go about with trollmydames I knew him once a servant of the prince I cannot tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court CLOWN His vices you would say theres no virtue whipped out of the court They cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide AUTOLYCUS Vices I would say sir I know this man well He hath been since an apebearer then a processserver a bailiff Then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinkers wife within a mile where

Lepidus and henceforth know It is not Caesars natural vice to hate Our great competitor From Alexandria This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he hardly gave audience or Vouchsafed to think he had partners You shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults That all men follow LEPIDUS I must not think there are Evils enough to darken all his goodness His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven More fiery by nights blackness hereditary Rather than purchased what he cannot change Than what he chooses CAESAR You are too indulgent Lets grant it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of PtolemyTo give a kingdom for a mirth to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat Say this becomes him As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemishyet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him fort But to confound such time

judgment Enter a Messenger LEPIDUS Heres more news MESSENGER Thy biddings have been done and every hour Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report How tis abroad Pompey is strong at sea And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar To the ports The discontents repair and mens reports Give him much wronged CAESAR I should have known no less It hath been taught us from the primal

name strikes more Than could his war resisted CAESAR Antony Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once Was beaten from Modena where thou slewst Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel Did famine follow whom thou foughtst against Though daintily brought up with patience more Than savages could suffer Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets The barks of trees thou browsed On the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh Which some did die to look on And all this It wounds thine honour that I speak it now Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek So much as lanked not LEPIDUS Tis pity of him CAESAR Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i th field and to that end Assemble we immediate council Pompey Thrives in our idleness LEPIDUS Tomorrow Caesar I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time CAESAR Till which encounter It is my business too Farewell LEPIDUS Farewell my lord What you shall know meantime

Wheres my serpent of old Nile For so he calls me Now I feed myself With most delicious poison Think on me That am with Phbus amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time Broadfronted Caesar When

Is twice the other twain But let us rear The higher our opinion that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypts widow pluck The neer lustwearied Antony MENAS I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together His wife thats dead did trespasses to Caesar His brother warred upon him although I think Not moved by Antony POMPEY I know not Menas How lesser enmities may give way to greater Weret not that we stand up against them all Twere pregnant they should square between themselves For they have entertained cause enough To draw their swords But how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference we yet not know Bet as our gods will havet It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands Come Menas Exeunt SCENE II Rome A Room in the House of Lepidus

their contestation Was theme for you you were the word of war ANTONY You do mistake your business My brother never Did urge me in his act I did inquire it And have my learning from some true reports

indeed or my reporter devised well for her ENOBARBUS I will tell you The barge she sat in like a burnished throne Burned on the water The poop was beaten gold Purple the sails and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made The water which they beat to follow faster As amorous of their strokes For her own person It beggared all description she did lie In her pavilion clothofgold of tissue Oerpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids With diverscoloured fans whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool And what they undid did AGRIPPA O rare for Antony ENOBARBUS Her gentlewomen like the Nereides So many mermaids tended her i th eyes And made their bends adornings At the helm A seeming mermaid steers The silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands That yarely frame the office From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast Her people out upon her and Antony Enthroned i th marketplace did sit alone Whistling to th air which but for vacancy Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too And made a gap in nature AGRIPPA Rare Egyptian ENOBARBUS Upon her landing Antony sent to her Invited her to supper She replied It should be better he became

spoke and panted That she did make defect perfection And breathless pour breath forth MAECENAS Now Antony must leave her utterly ENOBARBUS Never He will not Age cannot wither her nor custom stale Her infinite variety Other women cloy The appetites they feed but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies For vilest things Become themselves in her that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish

the traitors head And rear it in the place your fathers stands And now to London with triumphant march There to be crowned Englands royal king From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen So shalt thou sinew both these lands together And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread The scattered foe that hopes to rise again For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears First will I see the coronation And then to Brittany Ill cross the sea To effect this marriage so it please my lord EDWARD Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be For in thy shoulder do I build my seat And never will I undertake the thing Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best RICHARD Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester For Gloucesters dukedom is too ominous WARWICK Tut thats a foolish observation Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London To see these honours in possession Exeunt ACT III SCENE I A Forest in the North of England Enter two Keepers with crossbows in their hands 1

French Kings sister To wife for Edward If this news be true Poor queen and son your labour is but lost For Warwick is a subtle orator And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words By this account then Margaret may win him For shes a woman to be pitied much Her sighs will make a battry in his breast Her tears will pierce into a marble heart The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn And Nero will be tainted with remorse To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears Ay but shes come to beg Warwick to give She on his left side craving aid for Henry He on his right asking a wife for Edward She weeps and says her Henry is deposed He smiles and says his Edward is installed That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong Inferreth arguments of mighty strength And in conclusion wins the King from her With promise of his sister and what else To strengthen and support King Edwards place O Margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul Art then forsaken as thou wentst forlorn 2 KEEPER Say what art thou that talkst of kings and queens KING HENRY More than I seem and less than I was born to A man at least for less I should not be And men may talk of kings and why not I 2 KEEPER Ay but thou talkst as if thou wert a king KING HENRY Why so I am in mind and thats enough 2 KEEPER But if thou be a king where is thy crown KING HENRY My crown is in my heart not on my head Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones Not to be seen My crown is called content A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy 2 KEEPER Well if you be a king crowned with content Your crown content and you must be contented To go along with us for as we think You are the king King Edward hath deposed And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance Will apprehend you as his enemy KING HENRY But did you never swear and break an oath 2 KEEPER No never such an oath nor will not now KING HENRY Where did you dwell when I was King of England 2 KEEPER Here in this country where we now remain KING HENRY I was anointed king at nine months old My father and my grandfather were kings And you were sworn true subjects unto me And tell me then have you not broke your oaths 1 KEEPER No for we were subjects but while you were king KING HENRY Why am I dead Do I not breathe a man Ah simple men you know not what you swear Look as I blow this feather from my face And as the air blows it to me again Obeying with my wind when I do blow And yielding to another when it blows Commanded always by the greater gust Such is the lightness of you common men But do not break your oaths for of that sin My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty Go where you will the King shall be commanded And be you kings command and Ill obey 1 KEEPER We are true subjects to the King King Edward KING HENRY

EDWARD Now tell me madam do you love your children LADY GREY Ay full as dearly as I love myself KING EDWARD And would you not do much to do them good LADY GREY To do them good I would sustain some harm KING EDWARD Then get your husbands lands to do them good LADY GREY Therefore I came unto your majesty KING EDWARD Ill tell you how these lands are to be got LADY GREY So shall you bind me to your Highness service KING EDWARD What service wilt thou do me if I give them LADY GREY What you command that rests in me to do KING EDWARD But you will take exceptions to my boon LADY GREY No gracious

marble GEORGE Aside to Richard As red as fire Nay then her wax must melt LADY GREY Why stops my lord Shall I not hear my task KING EDWARD An easy task tis but to love a king LADY GREY Thats soon performed because I am a subject KING EDWARD Why then thy husbands lands I freely give thee LADY GREY I take my leave with many thousand thanks RICHARD Aside to George The match is made she seals it with a curtsy KING EDWARD But stay thee tis the fruits of love I mean LADY GREY The fruits of love I mean my loving liege KING EDWARD Ay but I fear me in another sense What love thinkst thou I sue so much to get LADY GREY My love till death my humble thanks my prayers That love which virtue begs and virtue grants KING EDWARD No by my troth I did not mean such love LADY GREY Why then you mean not as I thought you did KING EDWARD But now you partly may perceive my mind LADY GREY My mind will never grant what I perceive Your Highness aims at if I aim aright KING EDWARD To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee LADY GREY To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison KING EDWARD Why then thou shalt not have thy husbands lands LADY GREY Why then mine honesty shall be my dower For by that loss I will not purchase them KING EDWARD Therein thou wrongst thy children mightily LADY GREY Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me But mighty lord this merry inclination Accords not with the sadness of my suit Please you dismiss me either with ay or no KING EDWARD Ay if thou wilt say ay to my request No if thou dost say no to my demand LADY GREY Then no my lord My suit is at an end RICHARD Aside to George The widow likes him not she knits her brows GEORGE Aside to Richard He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom KING EDWARD Aside Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty Her words doth show her wit incomparable All her perfections challenge sovereignty One way or other she is for a king And she shall be my love or else my queen Say that King Edward take thee for his queen LADY GREY Tis better said than done my gracious lord I am a subject fit to jest withal But far unfit to be a sovereign KING EDWARD Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee I speak no more than what my soul intends And that is to enjoy thee for my love LADY GREY And that is more than I will yield unto I know I am too mean to be your queen And yet too good to be your concubine KING EDWARD You cavil widow

done his shrift GEORGE Aside to Richard When he was made a shriver twas for shift KING EDWARD Brothers you muse what chat we two have had Richard and George come forward RICHARD The widow likes it not for she looks very sad KING EDWARD Youd think it strange if I should marry her GEORGE To whom my lord KING EDWARD Why Clarence to myself RICHARD That would be ten days wonder at the least GEORGE Thats a day longer than a wonder lasts RICHARD By so much is the wonder in extremes KING EDWARD Well jest on brothers I can tell you both Her suit is granted for her husbands lands Enter a Nobleman NOBLEMAN My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken And brought your prisoner to your palace gate KING EDWARD See that he be conveyed unto the Tower And go we brothers to the man that took him To question of his apprehension Widow go you along Lords use her honourably Exeunt all but Richard RICHARD Ay Edward will use women honourably Would he were wasted marrow bones and all That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring To cross me from the golden time I look for And yet between my souls desire and me The lustful Edwards title buried Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward And all the unlookedfor issue of their bodies To take their rooms ere I can place myself A cold premeditation for my purpose Why then I do but dream on sovereignty Like one that stands upon a promontory And spies a faroff shore where he would tread Wishing his foot were equal with his eye And chides the sea that sunders him from thence Saying hell lade it dry to have his way So do I wish the crown being so far off And so I chide the means that keeps me from it And so I say Ill cut the causes off Flattering me with impossibilities My eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much Unless my hand and strength could equal them Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard What other pleasure can the world afford Ill make my heaven in a ladys lap And deck my body in gay ornaments And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks O miserable thought and more unlikely Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns Why Love forswore me in my mothers womb And for I should not deal in her soft laws She did corrupt frail Nature with some bribe To shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub To make an envious mountain on my back Where sits Deformity to mock my body To shape my legs of an unequal size To disproportion me in every part Like to a chaos or an unlicked bearwhelp That carries no impression like the dam And am I then a man to be beloved O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought Then since this earth affords no joy to me But to command to check to oerbear such As are of better person than myself Ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown And whiles I live t account this world but hell Until my misshaped trunk that bear this head Be round impaled with a glorious crown And yet I know not how to get the crown For many lives stand between me and home And I like one lost in a thorny wood That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns Seeking a way and straying from the way Not knowing how to find the open air But toiling desperately to find it out Torment myself to catch the English crown And from that torment I will free myself Or hew my way out with a bloody axe Why I can smile and murder while I smile And cry Content to that which grieves my heart And wet my cheeks with artificial tears And frame my face to all occasions Ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall Ill slay more gazers than the basilisk Ill play the orator as well as Nestor Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could And like a Sinon take another Troy I can add colours to the chameleon Change shapes with Proteus for advantages And set the murderous Machiavel to school Can I do this and cannot get a crown Tut were it farther off Ill pluck it down Exit SCENE III France The Kings Palace Flourish Enter Lewis the French King his sister the Lady Bona his Admiral called Bourbon Prince Edward Queen Margaret and the Earl of Oxford Lewis sits and riseth up again KING LEWIS Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret Sit down with us It ill befits thy state And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit QUEEN MARGARET No mighty King of France Now Margaret Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve Where kings command I was I must confess Great Albions queen in former golden days But now mischance hath trod my title down And with dishonour laid me on the ground Where I must take like seat unto my fortune And to my humble seat conform myself KING LEWIS Why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair QUEEN MARGARET From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears And stops my tongue while heart is drowned in cares KING LEWIS Whateer it be be thou still like thyself And sit thee by our side Yield not thy neck Seats her by himTo Fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief It shall be eased if France can yield relief QUEEN MARGARET Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry sole possessor of my love Is of a king become a banished man And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of Englands trueanointed lawful king This is the cause that I poor Margaret With this my son Prince Edward Henrys heir Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid And if thou fail us all our hope is done Scotland hath will to help but cannot help Our people and our peers are both misled Our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight KING LEWIS Renowned queen with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it off QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay the stronger grows our foe KING LEWIS The more I stay the more Ill succour thee QUEEN MARGARET O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow Enter Warwick KING LEWIS Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence QUEEN MARGARET Our Earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friend KING LEWIS Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France He descends Queen Margaret rises QUEEN MARGARET Ay now begins a second storm to rise For this is he that moves both wind and tide WARWICK From worthy Edward king of Albion My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend I come in kindness and unfeigned love First to do greetings to thy royal person And then to crave a league of amity And lastly to confirm that amity With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister To Englands king in lawful marriage QUEEN MARGARET Aside If that go forward Henrys hope is done WARWICK To Bona And gracious madam in our kings behalf I am commanded with your leave and favour Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue To tell the passion of my sovereigns heart Where fame late entering at his heedful ears Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak Before you answer Warwick His demand Springs not from Edwards wellmeant honest love But from deceit bred by necessity For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice That Henry liveth still but were he dead Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henrys son Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour For though usurpers sway the rule awhile Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs WARWICK Injurious Margaret PRINCE EDWARD And why not Queen WARWICK Because thy father Henry did usurp And thou no more art prince than she is queen OXFORD Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth Who by his prowess conquered all France From these our Henry lineally descends WARWICK Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten Methinks these peers of France should smile at that But for the rest you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years a silly time To make prescription for a kingdoms worth OXFORD Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years And not bewray thy treason with a blush WARWICK Can Oxford that did ever fence the right Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree For shame Leave Henry and call Edward king OXFORD Call him my king by whose injurious doom My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere Was done to death And more than so my father Even in the downfall of his mellowed years When nature brought him to the door of death No Warwick no while life upholds this arm This arm upholds the house of Lancaster WARWICK And I the house of York KING LEWIS Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside While I use further conference with Warwick They stand aloof QUEEN MARGARET Heavens grant that Warwicks words bewitch him not KING LEWIS Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience Is Edward your true king For I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosen WARWICK Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour KING LEWIS But is he gracious in the peoples eye WARWICK The more that Henry was unfortunate KING LEWIS Then further all dissembling set aside Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona WARWICK Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself Myself have often heard him say and swear That this his love was an eternal plant Whereof the root was fixed in virtues ground The leaves and fruit maintained with beautys sun Exempt from envy but not from disdain Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain KING LEWIS Now sister let us hear your firm resolve BONA Your grant or your denial shall be mine To Warwick Yet I confess that often ere this day When I have heard your kings desert recounted Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire KING LEWIS Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwards And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king PRINCE EDWARD To Edward but not to the English king QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend KING LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret But if your title to the crown be weak As may appear by Edwards good success Then tis but reason that I be released From giving aid which late I promised Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield WARWICK Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease Where having nothing nothing can he lose And as for you yourself our quondam queen You have a father able to maintain you And better twere you troubled him than France QUEEN MARGARET Peace impudent and shameless Warwick Proud setter up and puller down of kings I will not hence till with my talk and tears Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love For both of you are birds of selfsame feather Post blowing a horn within KING LEWIS Warwick this is some post to us or thee Enter the Post POST My lord ambassador these letters are for you Sent from your brother Marquess Montague These from our king unto your Majesty And madam these for you from whom I know not They all read their letters OXFORD I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his PRINCE EDWARD Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled I hope alls for the best KING LEWIS Warwick what are thy news And yours fair Queen QUEEN MARGARET Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys WARWICK Mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent KING LEWIS What has your king married the Lady Grey And now to soothe your forgery and his Sends me a paper to persuade me patience Is this th alliance that he seeks with France Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner QUEEN MARGARET I told your majesty as much before This proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honesty WARWICK King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss That I am clear from this misdeed of Edwards No more my king for he dishonours me But most himself if he could see his shame Did I forget that by the house of York My father came untimely to his death Did I let pass th abuse done to my niece Did I impale him with the regal crown Did I put Henry from his native right And am I guerdoned at the last with shame Shame on himself for my desert is honour And to repair my honour lost for him I here renounce him and return to Henry My noble Queen let former grudges pass And henceforth I am thy true servitor I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona And replant Henry in his former state QUEEN MARGARET Warwick these words have turned my hate to love And I forgive and quite forget old faults And joy that thou becomst King Henrys friend WARWICK So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers Ill undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war Tis not his newmade bride shall succour him And as for Clarence as my letters tell me Hes very likely now to fall from him For matching more for wanton lust than honour Or than for strength and safety of our country BONA Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged But by thy help to this distressed queen QUEEN MARGARET Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live Unless thou rescue him from foul despair BONA My quarrel and this English queens are one WARWICK And mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours KING LEWIS And mine with hers and thine and Margarets Therefore at last I firmly am resolved You shall have aid QUEEN MARGARET Let me give humble thanks for all at once KING LEWIS Then Englands messenger return in post And tell false Edward thy supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over maskers To revel it with him and his new bride Thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal BONA Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly Ill wear the willow garland for his sake QUEEN MARGARET Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside And I am ready to put armour on WARWICK Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore Ill uncrown him ere t be long Theres thy reward be gone Exit Post KING LEWIS But Warwick Thou and Oxford with five thousand men Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle And as occasion serves this noble Queen And prince shall follow with a fresh supply Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty WARWICK This shall assure my constant loyalty That if our Queen and this young prince agree Ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands QUEEN MARGARET Yes I agree and thank you for your motion Son Edward she is fair and virtuousTherefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable That only Warwicks daughter shall be thine PRINCE EDWARD Yes I accept her for she well deserves it And here to pledge my vow I give my hand He gives his hand to Warwick KING LEWIS Why stay we now These soldiers shall be levied And thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral Shall waft them over with our royal fleet I long till Edward fall by wars mischance For mocking marriage with a dame of France Exeunt all but Warwick WARWICK I came from Edward as ambassador But I return his sworn and mortal foe Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me But dreadful war shall answer his demand Had he none else to make a stale but me Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow I was the chief that raised him to the crown And Ill be chief to bring him down again Not that I pity Henrys misery But seek revenge on Edwards mockery Exit ACT IV SCENE I London The Palace Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester George Duke of Clarence Somerset and Montague RICHARD Now tell me brother Clarence what think you Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey Hath not our brother made a worthy choice GEORGE Alas you know tis far from hence to France How could he stay till Warwick made return SOMERSET My lords forbear this talk here comes the King Flourish Enter King Edward attended Lady Grey as Queen Elizabeth Pembroke Stafford Hastings and others Four stand on one side and four on the other RICHARD And his wellchosen bride GEORGE I mind to tell him plainly what I think KING EDWARD Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice That you stand pensive as half malcontent GEORGE As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That theyll take no offence at our abuse KING EDWARD Suppose they take offence without a cause They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward Your King and Warwicks and must have my will RICHARD And shall have your will because our King Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well KING EDWARD Yea brother Richard are you offended too RICHARD Not I No God forbid that I should wish them severed Whom God hath joined together Ay and twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well together KING EDWARD Setting your scorns and your mislike aside Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and Englands queen And you too Somerset and Montague Speak freely what you think GEORGE Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis Becomes your enemy for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady Bona RICHARD And Warwick doing what you gave in charge Is now dishonoured by this new marriage KING EDWARD What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased By such invention as I can devise MONTAGUE Yet to have joined with France in such alliance Would more have strengthened this our commonwealth Gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage HASTINGS Why knows not Montague that of itself England is safe if true within itself MONTAGUE But the safer when tis backed with France HASTINGS Tis better using France than trusting France Let us be backed with God and with the seas Which He hath givn for fence impregnable And with their helps only defend ourselves In them and in ourselves our safety lies GEORGE For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford KING EDWARD Ay what of that It was my will and grant And for this once my will shall stand for law RICHARD And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride She better would have fitted me or Clarence But in your bride you bury brotherhood GEORGE Or else you would not have bestowed the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wifes son And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere KING EDWARD Alas poor Clarence is it for a wife That thou art malcontent I will provide thee GEORGE In choosing for yourself you showed your judgment Which being shallow you shall give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf And to that end I shortly mind to leave you KING EDWARD Leave me or tarry Edward will be king And not be tied unto his brothers will QUEEN ELIZABETH My lords before it pleased his Majesty To raise my state to title of a queen Do me but right and you must all confess That I was not ignoble of descent And meaner than myself have had like fortune But as this title honours me and mine So your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow KING EDWARD My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns What danger or what sorrow can befall thee So long as Edward is thy constant friend And their true sovereign whom they must obey Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too Unless they seek for hatred at my hands Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath RICHARD Aside I hear yet say not much but think the more Enter a Post KING EDWARD Now messenger what letters or what news From France POST My sovereign liege no letters and few words But such as I without your special pardon Dare not relate KING EDWARD Go to we pardon

But what said Warwick to these injuries POST He more incensed against your Majesty Than all the rest discharged me with these words Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore Ill uncrown him ere t be long KING EDWARD Ha Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words Well I will arm me being thus forewarned They shall have wars and pay for their presumption But say is Warwick friends with Margaret POST Ay gracious sovereign they are so linked in friendship That young Prince Edward marries Warwicks daughter GEORGE Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger Now brother king farewell and sit you fast For I will hence to Warwicks other daughter That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage I may not prove inferior to yourself You that love me and Warwick follow me Exit George and Somerset follows RICHARD Aside Not I My thoughts aim at a further matter I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown KING EDWARD Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick Yet am I armed against the worst can happen And haste is needful in this desperate case Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf Go levy men and make prepare for war They are already or quickly will be landed Myself in person will straight follow you Exeunt Pembroke and Stafford But ere I go Hastings and Montague Resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance Tell me if you love Warwick more than me If it be so then both depart to him I rather wish you foes than hollow friends But if you mind to hold your true obedience Give me assurance with some friendly vow That I may never have you in suspect MONTAGUE So God help Montague as he proves true HASTINGS And Hastings as he favours Edwards cause KING EDWARD Now brother Richard will you stand by us RICHARD Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you KING EDWARD Why so Then am I sure of victory Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power Exeunt SCENE II A Plain in Warwickshire Enter Warwick and Oxford in England with French Soldiers WARWICK Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well The common people by numbers swarm to us Enter George Duke of Clarence and Somerset But see where Somerset and Clarence comes Speak suddenly my lords are we all friends GEORGE Fear not that my lord WARWICK Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice To rest mistrustful where a noble heart Hath pawned an open hand in sign of love Else might I think that Clarence Edwards brother Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine And now what rests but in nights coverture Thy brother being carelessly encamped His soldiers lurking in the towns about And but attended by a simple guard We

best friends if they Should say Be good to Rome they charged him even As those should do that had deserved his hate And therein showed like enemies MENENIUS Tis true If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it I have not the face To say Beseech you ceaseYou have made fair hands You and your crafts You have crafted fair COMINIUS You have brought A trembling upon Rome such as was never S incapable of help TRIBUNES Say not we brought it MENENIUS How Was it we We loved him but like beasts And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters Who did hoot him out o th city COMINIUS But I fear Theyll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius The second name of men obeys his points As if he were his officer Desperation Is all the policy strength and defence That Rome can make against them Enter a troop of Citizens MENENIUS Here comes the clusters And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus exile

understand thee well and be thou sure When he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th vulgar eye that he

mine Wheneer we come to our account LIEUTENANT Sir I beseech you think you hell carry Rome AUFIDIUS All places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his The Senators and

fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From th casque to th cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controlled the war but one of these As he hath spices of them allnot all For I dare so far free himmade him feared So hated and so banished But he has a merit To choke it in the uttrance So our virtues Lie in th interpretation of the time And power unto itself most commendable Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair T extol what it hath done One fire drives out one fire one

less COMINIUS I offered to awaken his regard Fors private friends His answer to me was He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff He said twas folly For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt And still to nose th offence MENENIUS For one poor grain or two I am one of those His mother wife his child And this brave fellow too we are the grains You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon We must be burnt for you SICINIUS Nay pray be patient If you refuse your aid In this soneverneeded help yet do not Upbraids with our distress But sure if you Would be your

SICINIUS Not COMINIUS I tell you he does sit in gold his eye Red as twould burn Rome and his injury The jailer to his pity I kneeled before him Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissed me Thus with his speechless hand What he would do He sent in writing after me what he Would not bound with an oath to yield to his Conditions So that all hope is vain Unless his noble mother and his wife Who as I

Lords Heralds Officers Soldiers Gardeners Keeper Messenger Groom and other Attendants SCENE Dispersedly in England and Wales ACT I SCENE I London A Room in the palace Enter King Richard John of Gaunt with other Nobles and Attendants KING RICHARD Old John of Gaunt timehonoured Lancaster Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boistrous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray GAUNT I have my liege KING RICHARD Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in him GAUNT As near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aimed at your Highness no inveterate malice KING RICHARD Then call them to our presence Face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak Highstomached are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire Enter Bolingbroke and Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign my most loving liege MOWBRAY Each day still better others happiness Until the heavens envying earths good hap Add an immortal title to your crown KING RICHARD We thank you both Yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Firstheaven be the record to my speech In the devotion of a subjects love Tendring the precious safety of my prince And free from other misbegotten hate Come I appellant to this princely presence Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to be so and too bad to live Since the more fair and crystal is the sky The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly Once more the more to aggravate the note With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat And wish so please my sovereign ere I move What my tongue speaks my rightdrawn sword may prove MOWBRAY Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal Tis not the trial of a womans war The bitter clamour of two eager tongues Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cooled for this Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hushed and naught at all to say First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had returned These terms of treason doubled down his throat Setting aside his high bloods royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Wherever Englishman durst set his foot Meantime let this defend my loyalty By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie BOLINGBROKE Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the King And lay aside my high bloods royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise MOWBRAY I take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder Ill answer thee in any fair degree Or chivalrous design of knightly trial And when I mount alive may I not light If I be traitor or unjustly fight KING RICHARD What doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays charge It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him BOLINGBROKE Look what I speak my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your highness soldiers The which he hath detained for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain Besides I say and will in battle prove Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was surveyed by English eye That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spent KING RICHARD How high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this MOWBRAY O let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men hate so foul a liar KING RICHARD Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears Were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir As he is but my fathers brothers son Now by my sceptres awe I make a vow Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul He is our subject Mowbray so art thou Free speech and fearless I to thee allow MOWBRAY Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disbursed I duly to his highness soldiers The other part reserved I by consent For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account Since last I went to France to fetch his queen Now swallow down that lie For Gloucesters death I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case For you my noble Lord of Lancaster The honourable father to my foeOnce did I lay an ambush for your life A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it and exactly begged Your Graces pardon and I hope I had it This is my fault As for the rest appealed It issues from the rancour of a villain A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitors foot To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom In haste whereof most heartily I pray Your highness to assign our trial day KING RICHARD Wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me Lets purge this choler without letting blood This we prescribe though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed Good uncle let this end where it begun Well calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son GAUNT To be a makepeace shall become my age Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolks gage KING RICHARD And Norfolk throw down his GAUNT When Harry when Obedience bids I should not bid again KING RICHARD Norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot MOWBRAY Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot My life thou shalt command but not my shame The one my duty owes but my fair name Despite of death that lives upon my grave To dark dishonours use thou shalt not have I am disgraced impeached and baffled here Pierced to the soul with slanders venomed spear The which no balm can cure but his heartblood Which breathed this poison KING RICHARD Rage must be withstood Give me his gage Lions make leopards tame MOWBRAY Yea but not change his spots Take but my shame And I resign my gage My dear dear lord The purest treasure mortal times afford Is spotless reputation that away Men are but gilded loam or painted clay A jewel in a tentimesbarredup chest Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast Mine honour is my life both grow in one Take honour from me and my life is done Then dear my liege mine honour let me try In that I live and for that will I die KING RICHARD Cousin throw up your gage do you begin BOLINGBROKE O God defend my soul from such deep sin Shall I seem crestfallen in my fathers sight Or with pale beggarfear impeach my height Before this outdared dastard Ere my tongue Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear The slavish motive of recanting fear And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbrays face Exit Gaunt KING RICHARD We were not born to sue but to command Which since we cannot do to make you friends Be ready as your lives shall answer it At Coventry upon Saint Lamberts day There shall your swords and lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your settled hate Since we cannot atone you we shall see Justice design the victors chivalry Lord Marshal command our officersatarms Be ready to direct these home alarms Exeunt SCENE II The same A room in the Duke of Lancasters palace Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester GAUNT Alas the part I had in Woodstocks blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims To stir against the butchers of his life But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven Who when they see the hours ripe on earth Will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads DUCHESS Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur Hath love in thy old blood no living fire Edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one Were as seven vials of his sacred blood Or seven fair branches springing from one root Some of those seven are dried by natures course Some of those branches by the Destinies cut But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester One vial full of Edwards sacred blood One flourishing branch of his most royal root Is cracked and all the precious liquor spilt Is hacked down and his summer leaves all faded By envys hand and murders bloody axe Ah Gaunt his blood was thine That bed that womb That metal that self mould that fashioned thee Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest Yet art thou slain in him Thou dost consent In some large measure to thy fathers death In that thou seest thy wretched brother die Who was the model of thy fathers life Call it not patience Gaunt it is despair In suffring thus thy brother to be slaughtered Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee That which in mean men we entitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts What shall I say To safeguard thine own life The best way is to venge my Gloucesters death GAUNT Gods is the quarrel for Gods substitute His deputy anointed in His sight Hath caused his death the which if wrongfully Let heaven revenge for I may never lift An angry arm against His minister DUCHESS Where then alas may I complain myself GAUNT To God the widows champion and defence DUCHESS Why then I will Farewell old Gaunt Thou goest to Coventry there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight O sit my husbands wrongs on Herefords spear That it may enter butcher Mowbrays breast Or if misfortune miss the first career Be Mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom That they may break his foaming coursers back And throw the rider headlong in the lists A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford Farewell old Gaunt Thy sometimes brothers wife With her companion Grief must end her life GAUNT Sister farewell I must to Coventry As much good stay with thee as go with me DUCHESS Yet one word more Grief boundeth where it falls Not with the empty hollowness but weight I take my leave before I have begun For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done Commend me to thy brother Edmund York Lo this is all Nay yet depart not so Though this be all do not so quickly go I shall remember more Bid himah what With all good speed at Plashy visit me Alack and what shall good old York there see But empty lodgings and unfurnished walls Unpeopled offices untrodden stones And what hear there for welcome but my groans

harmony Within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue Doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips And dull unfeeling barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me I am"

yea though I love him I should CLAUDIO Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses O sweet Benedick God give me patience LEONATO She doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself It is very true DON PEDRO It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it CLAUDIO To what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse DON PEDRO And he should it were an alms to hang him Shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous CLAUDIO And she is exceeding wise DON PEDRO In everything but in loving Benedick LEONATO O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian DON PEDRO I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say LEONATO Were it good think you CLAUDIO Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness DON PEDRO She doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the manas you know allhath a contemptible spirit CLAUDIO He is a very proper man DON PEDRO He hath indeed a good outward happiness CLAUDIO Fore God and in my mind very wise DON PEDRO He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit CLAUDIO And I take him to be valiant DON PEDRO As Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear LEONATO If he do fear God a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling DON PEDRO And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love CLAUDIO Never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel LEONATO Nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first DON PEDRO Well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady LEONATO My lord will you walk dinner is ready CLAUDIO Aside If he do not dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation DON PEDRO Aside Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumb show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Exeunt Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato BENEDICK Advancing from the arbour This can be no trick the conference was sadly borne They have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair tis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous tis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day shes a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her Enter Beatrice BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner BENEDICK Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful I would not have come BENEDICK You take pleasure then in the message BEATRICE Yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior fare you well Exit BENEDICK Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture Exit ACT III SCENE I Leonatos Garden Enter Hero Margaret and Ursula HERO Good Margaret run thee to the parlour There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursala Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her say that thou overheardst us And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripend by the sun Forbid the sun to enter like favourites Made proud by princes that advance their pride Against that power that bred it There will she hide her To listen our propose This is thy office Bear thee well in it and leave us aloneMARGARET Ill make her come I warrant you presently Exit HERO Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come As we do trace this alley up and down Our talk must only be of Benedick When I do name him let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice of this matter Is little Cupids crafty arrow made That only wounds by hearsay Enter Beatrice behind Now begin For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground to hear our conference URSULA The pleasantst angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait So angle we for Beatrice who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture Fear you not my part of the dialogue HERO Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it They advance to the bower No truly Ursula she is too disdainful I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock URSULA But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely HERO So says the Prince and my newtrothed lord URSULA And did they bid you tell her of it madam HERO They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them if they lovd Benedick To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it URSULA Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon HERO O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man But Nature never framd a womans heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes Misprising what they look on and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so selfendeard URSULA Sure I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love lest she make sport at it HERO Why you speak truth I never yet saw man How wise how noble young how rarely featurd But she would spell him backward if fairfacd She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black why Nature drawing of an antick Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded If low an agate very vilely cut If speaking why a vane blown with all winds If silent why a block moved with none So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth URSULA Sure sure such carping is not commendable HERO No not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is cannot be commendable But who dare tell her so If I should speak She would mock me into air O she would laugh me Out of myself press me to death with wit Therefore let Benedick like coverd fire Consume away in sighs waste inwardly It were a better death than die with mocks Which is as bad as die with tickling URSULA Yet tell her of it hear what she will say HERO No rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And truly Ill devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking URSULA O do not do your cousin such a wrong She cannot be so much without true judgment Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prizd to haveas to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick HERO He is the only man of Italy Always excepted my dear Claudio URSULA I pray you be not angry with me madam Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick For shape for bearing argument and valour Goes foremost in report through Italy HERO Indeed he hath an excellent good name URSULA His excellence did earn it ere he had it When are you married madam HERO Why every day tomorrow Come go in Ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow URSULA Shes limd I warrant you We have caught her madam HERO If it prove so then loving goes by haps Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps Exeunt Hero and Ursula BEATRICE Advancing What fire is in mine ears Can this be true Stand I condemnd for pride and scorn so much Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu No glory lives behind the back of such And Benedick love on I will requite thee Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band For others say thou dost deserve and I Believe it better than reportingly Exit SCENE II A Room in Leonatos House Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick and Leonato DON PEDRO I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Arragon CLAUDIO Ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me DON PEDRO Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks BENEDICK Gallants I am not as I have been LEONATO So say I methinks you are sadder CLAUDIO I hope he be in love DON PEDRO Hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love If he be sad he wants money BENEDICK I have the toothache DON PEDRO Draw it BENEDICK Hang it CLAUDIO You must hang it first and draw it afterwards DON PEDRO What sigh for the toothache LEONATO Where is but a humour or a worm BENEDICK Well everyone can master a grief but he that has it CLAUDIO Yet say I he is in love DON PEDRO There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman today a Frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is CLAUDIO If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode DON PEDRO Hath any man seen him at the barbers CLAUDIO No but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls LEONATO Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard DON PEDRO Nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that CLAUDIO Thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love DON PEDRO The greatest note of it is his melancholy CLAUDIO And when was he wont to wash his face DON PEDRO Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say of him CLAUDIO Nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now governed by stops DON PEDRO Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude he is in love CLAUDIO Nay but I know who loves him DON PEDRO That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not CLAUDIO Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him DON PEDRO She shall be buried with her face upwards BENEDICK Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old signior walk aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobbyhorses must not hear Exeunt Benedick and Leonato DON PEDRO For my life to break with him about Beatrice CLAUDIO Tis even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet Enter Don John DON JOHN My lord and brother God save you DON PEDRO Good den brother DON JOHN If your leisure served I would speak with you DON PEDRO In private DON JOHN If it please you yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns him DON PEDRO Whats the matter DON JOHN To Claudio Means your lordship to be married tomorrow DON PEDRO You know he does DON JOHN I know not that when he knows what I know CLAUDIO If there be any impediment I pray you discover it DON JOHN You may think I love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother I think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit illspent and labour ill bestowed DON PEDRO Why whats the matter DON JOHN I came hither to tell you and circumstances shortenedfor she has been too long a talking ofthe lady is disloyal CLAUDIO Who Hero DON JOHN Even she Leonatos Hero your Hero every mans Hero CLAUDIO Disloyal DON JOHN The words too good to paint out her wickedness I could say she were worse think you of a worse title and I will fit her to it Wonder not till further warrant go but with me tonight you shall see her chamber window entered even the night before her weddingday if you love her then tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind CLAUDIO May this be so DON PEDRO I will not think it DON JOHN If you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know If you will follow me I will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly CLAUDIO If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed there will I shame her DON PEDRO And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with thee to disgrace her DON JOHN I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself DON PEDRO O day untowardly turned CLAUDIO O mischief strangely thwarting DON JOHN O plague right well prevented So will you say when you have seen the sequel Exeunt Scene III A Street Enter Dogberry and Verges with the Watch DOGBERRY Are you good men and true VERGES Yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul DOGBERRY Nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the Princes watch VERGES Well give them their charge neighbour Dogberry DOGBERRY First who think you the most desartless man to be constable FIRST WATCH Hugh Oatcake sir or George Seacoal for they can write and read DOGBERRY Come hither neighbour Seacoal God hath blessed you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of Fortune but to write and read comes by Nature SECOND WATCH Both which Master Constable DOGBERRY You have I knew it would be your answer Well for your favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn This is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the Princes nameSECOND WATCH How if a will not stand DOGBERRY Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave VERGES If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the Princes subjects DOGBERRY True and they are to meddle with none but the Princes subjects You shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured SECOND WATCH We will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch DOGBERRY Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen Well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed SECOND WATCH How if they will not DOGBERRY Why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for SECOND WATCH Well sir DOGBERRY If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty SECOND WATCH If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him DOGBERRY Truly by your office you may but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled The most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company VERGES You have been always called a merciful man partner DOGBERRY Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him VERGES If you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it SECOND WATCH How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us DOGBERRY Why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats VERGES Tis very true DOGBERRY This is the end of the charge You constable are to present the Princes own person if you meet the Prince in the night you may stay him VERGES Nay byr lady that I think a cannot DOGBERRY Five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the Prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will VERGES Byr lady I think it be so DOGBERRY Ha ah ha Well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep

WATCH Aside Some treason masters yet stand close BORACHIO Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats CONRADE Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear BORACHIO Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will CONRADE I wonder at it BORACHIO That shows thou art unconfirmed Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man CONRADE Yes it is apparel BORACHIO I mean the fashion CONRADE Yes the fashion is the fashion BORACHIO

gentleman I remember his name BORACHIO Didst thou not hear somebody CONRADE No twas the vane on the house BORACHIO Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty sometime fashioning them like Pharaohs soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god Bels priests in the old church window sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club CONRADE All this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion BORACHIO Not so neither but know that I have tonight wooed Margaret the Lady Heros gentlewoman by the name of Hero she leans me out at her mistress chamber window bids me a thousand times good nightI tell this tale vilelyI should first tell thee how the Prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter CONRADE And thought they Margaret was Hero BORACHIO Two of them did the Prince and Claudio but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villainy which did confirm any slander that Don John had made away went Claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw oer night and send her home again without a husband FIRST WATCH We charge you in the Princes name stand SECOND WATCH Call up the right Master Constable We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever

Foresters and other Attendants The scene lies first near Olivers house afterwards partly in the Usurpers court and partly in the Forest of Arden ACT I SCENE I An Orchard near Olivers house Enter Orlando and Adam ORLANDO As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayst charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit For my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid itEnter Oliver ADAM Yonder comes my master your brother ORLANDO Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up Adam retires OLIVER Now sir what make you here ORLANDO Nothing I am not taught to make anything OLIVER What mar you then sir ORLANDO Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness OLIVER Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile ORLANDO Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury OLIVER Know you where you are sir ORLANDO O sir very well here in your orchard OLIVER Know you before whom sir ORLANDO Ay better than him I am before knows me I know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the firstborn but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence OLIVER What boy ORLANDO Come come elder brother you are too young in this OLIVER Wilt thou lay hands on me villain ORLANDO I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so Thou has railed on thyself ADAM Coming forward Sweet masters be patient For your fathers remembrance be at accord OLIVER Let me go I say ORLANDO I will not till I please You shall hear me My father charged you in his will to give me good education You have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy my fortunes OLIVER And what wilt thou do Beg when that is spent Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled with you You shall have some part of your will I pray you leave me ORLANDO I no further offend you than becomes me for my good OLIVER Get you with him you old dog ADAM Is old dog my reward Most true I have lost my teeth in your service God be with my old master He would not have spoke such a word Exeunt Orlando and Adam OLIVER Is it even so Begin you to grow upon me I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla Dennis Enter Dennis DENNIS Calls your worship OLIVER Was not Charles the Dukes wrestler here to speak with me DENNIS So please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you OLIVER Call him in Exit Dennis Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is Enter Charles CHARLES Good morrow to your worship OLIVER Good Monsieur Charles Whats the new news at the new court CHARLES Theres no news at the court sir but the old news That is the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander OLIVER Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter be banished with her father CHARLES O no for the Dukes daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do OLIVER Where will the old Duke live CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world OLIVER What you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in Therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will OLIVER Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other For I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come tomorrow Ill give him his payment If ever he go alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more And so God keep your worship Exit OLIVER Farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an end of him for my soulyet I know not whyhates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that I am altogether misprized But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about Exit SCENE II A Lawn before the Dukes Palace Enter Rosalind and Celia CELIA I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry ROSALIND Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure CELIA Herein I see thou lovst me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine So wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee ROSALIND Well I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours CELIA You know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection By mine honour I will And when I break that oath let me turn monster Therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry ROSALIND From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let me seewhat think you of falling in love CELIA Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again ROSALIND What shall be our sport then CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally ROSALIND I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women CELIA Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very illfavouredly ROSALIND Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of Nature Enter Touchstone CELIA No When Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ROSALIND Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of Natures wit CELIA Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the witsHow now wit whither wander you TOUCHSTONE Mistress you must come away to your father CELIA Were you made the messenger TOUCHSTONE No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you ROSALIND Where learned you that oath fool TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught Now Ill stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn CELIA How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ROSALIND Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom TOUCHSTONE Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave CELIA By our beards if we had them thou art TOUCHSTONE By my knavery if I had it then I were But if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn No more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard CELIA Prithee who ist that thou meanst TOUCHSTONE One that old Frederick your father loves CELIA My fathers love is enough to honour him Enough Speak no more of him Youll be whipped for taxation one of these days TOUCHSTONE The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly CELIA By my troth thou sayest true For since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le BeauEnter Le Beau ROSALIND With his mouth full of news CELIA Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young ROSALIND Then shall we be newscrammed CELIA All the better we shall be the more marketable Bonjour Monsieur Le Beau Whats the news LE BEAU Fair princess you have lost much good sport CELIA Sport Of what colour LE BEAU What colour madam How shall I answer you ROSALIND As wit and fortune will TOUCHSTONE Or as the destinies decrees CELIA Well said That was laid on with a trowel TOUCHSTONE Nay if I keep not my rank ROSALIND Thou losest thy old smell LE BEAU You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of ROSALIND Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling LE BEAU I will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it CELIA Well the beginning that is dead and buried LE BEAU There comes an old man and his three sons CELIA I could match this beginning with an old tale LE BEAU Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence ROSALIND With bills on their necks Be it known unto all men by these presents LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the Dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him So he served the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping ROSALIND Alas TOUCHSTONE But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost LE BEAU Why this that I speak of TOUCHSTONE Thus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies CELIA Or I I promise thee ROSALIND But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon ribbreaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin LE BEAU You must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it CELIA Yonder sure they are coming Let us now stay and see it Flourish Enter Duke Frederick Lords Orlando Charles and Attendants DUKE FREDERICK Come on Since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness ROSALIND Is yonder the man LE BEAU Even he madam CELIA Alas he is too young Yet he looks successfully DUKE FREDERICK How now daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ROSALIND Ay my liege so please you give us leave DUKE FREDERICK You will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man In pity of the challengers youth I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if you can move him CELIA Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau DUKE FREDERICK Do so Ill not be by Duke Frederick steps aside LE BEAU Monsieur the challenger the Princess calls for you ORLANDO I attend them with all respect and duty ROSALIND Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler ORLANDO No fair princess He is the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth CELIA Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years You have seen cruel proof of this mans strength If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt ROSALIND Do young sir Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward ORLANDO I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty ROSALIND The little strength that I have I would it were with you CELIA And mine to eke out hers ROSALIND Fare you well Pray heaven I be deceived in you CELIA Your hearts desires be with you CHARLES Come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ORLANDO Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working DUKE FREDERICK You shall try but one fall CHARLES No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first ORLANDO You mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before But come your ways ROSALIND Now Hercules be thy speed young man CELIA I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg Orlando and Charles wrestle ROSALIND O excellent young man CELIA If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down Charles is thrown Shout DUKE FREDERICK No more no more ORLANDO Yes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathed DUKE FREDERICK How dost thou Charles LE BEAU He cannot speak my lord DUKE FREDERICK Bear him away Charles is carried off by Attendants What is thy name young man ORLANDO Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys DUKE FREDERICK I would thou hadst been son to some man else The world esteemed thy father honourable But I did find him still mine enemy Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth I would thou hadst told me of another father Exeunt Duke Frederick Le Beau and Lords CELIA Were I my father coz would I do this ORLANDO I am more proud to be Sir Rowlands son His youngest son and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick ROSALIND My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul And all the world was of my fathers mind Had I before known this young man his son I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured CELIA Gentle cousin Let us go thank him and encourage him My fathers rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heartSir you have well deserved If you do keep your promises in love But justly as you have exceeded promise Your mistress shall be happy ROSALIND Gentleman Giving him a chain from her neck Wear this for meone out of suits with Fortune That could give more but that her hand lacks means Shall we go coz CELIA AyFare you well fair gentleman ORLANDO Can I not say I thank you My better parts Are all thrown down and that which here stands up Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block ROSALIND He calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes Ill ask him what he wouldDid you call sir Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemies CELIA Will you go coz ROSALIND Have with youFare you well Exeunt Rosalind and Celia ORLANDO What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue I cannot speak to her yet she urged conference O poor Orlando thou art overthrown Or Charles or something weaker masters thee Enter Le Beau LE BEAU Good sir I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place Albeit you have deserved High commendation true applause and love Yet such is now the Dukes condition That he misconsters all that you have done The Duke is humorous what he is indeed More suits you to conceive than I to speak of ORLANDO I thank you sir and pray you tell me this Which of the two was daughter of the Duke That here was at the wrestling LE BEAU Neither his daughter if we judge by manners But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter The other is daughter to the banished Duke And here detained by her usurping uncle To keep his daughter company whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters But I can tell you that of late this Duke Hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good fathers sake And on my life his malice gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well Hereafter in a better world than this I shall desire more love and knowledge of you ORLANDO I rest much bounden to you fare you well Exit Le Beau Thus must I from the smoke into the smother From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother But heavenly Rosalind Exit SCENE III A Room in the Palace Enter Celia and Rosalind CELIA Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy Not a word ROSALIND Not one to throw at a dog CELIA No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs Throw some of them at me Come lame me with reasons ROSALIND Then there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any CELIA But is all this for your father ROSALIND No some of it is for my childs father O how full of briers is this workingday world CELIA They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them ROSALIND I could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart CELIA Hem them away ROSALIND I would try if I could cry hem and have him CELIA Come come wrestle with thy affections ROSALIND O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself CELIA O a good wish upon you You will try in time in despite of a fall But turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowlands youngest son ROSALIND The Duke my father loved his father dearly CELIA Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate not Orlando ROSALIND No faith hate him not for my sake CELIA Why should I not Doth he not deserve well Enter Duke Frederick with Lords ROSALIND Let me love him for that and do you love him because I doLook here comes the Duke CELIA With his eyes full of anger DUKE FREDERICK Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste And get you from our court ROSALIND Me uncle DUKE FREDERICK You cousin Within these ten days if that thou best found So near our public court as twenty miles Thou diest for it ROSALIND I do beseech your Grace Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me If with myself I hold intelligenceOr have acquaintance with mine own desires If that I do not dream or be not frantic As I do trust I am notthen dear uncle Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness DUKE FREDERICK Thus do all traitors If their purgation did consist in words They are as innocent as grace itself Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not ROSALIND Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor Tell me whereon the likelihood depends DUKE FREDERICK Thou art thy fathers daughter theres enough ROSALIND So was I when your highness took his dukedom So was I when your highness banished him Treason is not inherited my lord Or if we did derive it from our friends Whats that to me My father was no traitor Then good my liege mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous CELIA Dear sovereign hear me speak DUKE FREDERICK Ay Celia we stayed her for your sake Else had she with her father ranged along CELIA I did not then entreat to have her stay It was your pleasure and your own remorse I was too young that time to value her But now I know her If she be a traitor Why so am I We still have slept together Rose at an instant learned played ate together And wheresoeer we went like Junos swans Still we went coupled and inseparable DUKE FREDERICK She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people and they pity her Thou art a fool She robs thee of thy name And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone Then open not thy lips Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her She is banished CELIA Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege I cannot live out of her

the extent Of legal justice used in such contempt My lords you know as know the mightful gods However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the peoples ears there naught hath passed But even with law against the wilful sons Of old Andronicus And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks His fits his frenzy and his bitterness And now he writes to heaven for his redress See heres to Jove and this to Mercury This to Apollo this to the god of war Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome Whats this but libelling against the senate And blazoning our injustice everywhere A goodly humour is it not my lords As who would say in Rome no justice were But if I live his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus health whom if she sleep Hell so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proudst conspirator that lives TAMORA My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine Lord of my life commander of my thoughts Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus age Th effects of sorrow for his valiant sons Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts Aside Why thus it shall become Highwitted Tamora to gloze with all But Titus I have touched thee to the quick Thy lifeblood out if Aaron now be wise Then is all safe the anchor in the port Enter Clown How now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us CLOWN Yes forsooth an your mistresship be emperial TAMORA Empress I am but yonder sits the emperor CLOWN Tis he God and Saint Stephen give you good een I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here Saturninus reads the letter SATURNINUS Go take him away and hang him presently CLOWN How much money must I have TAMORA Come sirrah you must be hanged CLOWN Hanged byr Lady then I have brought up a neck to a fair end Exit guarded SATURNINUS Despiteful and intolerable wrongs Shall I endure this monstrous villainy I know from whence this same device proceeds May this be borne as if his traitorous sons That died by law for murder of our brother Have by my means been butchered wrongfully Go drag the villain hither by the hair Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege For this proud mock Ill be thy slaughterman Sly frantic wretch that holpst to make me great In hope thyself should govern Rome and me Enter Aemilius What news with thee Aemilius AEMILIUS Arm my lord Rome never had more cause The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of highresolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus did SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor I will enchant the old AndronicusWith words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep Whenas the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feed SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us TAMORA If Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue to Aemilius Go thou before be our ambassador Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him best AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually Exit TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devices SATURNINUS Then go successantly and plead to him Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Plains near Rome Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with drums and soldiers LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us Well follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believst no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath AARON What if I do not As indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sisters tongue and ravished her And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest LUCIUS O detestable villain callst thou that trimming AARON Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons heads Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the empress of this sport She sounded almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses GOTH What canst thou say all this and never blush AARON Ay like a black dog as the saying is LUCIUS Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds AARON Ay that I had not done a thousand more Even now I curse the day and yet I think Few come within the compass of my curse Wherein I did not some notorious ill As kill a man or else devise his death Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it Accuse some innocent and forswear myself Set deadly enmity between two friends Make poor mens cattle break their necks Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night And bid the owners quench them with their tears Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves And set them upright at their dear friends door Even when their sorrows almost was forgot And on their skins as on the bark of trees Have with my knife carved in Roman letters Let not your sorrow die though I am dead But I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand more LUCIUS Bring down the devil for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presently AARON If there be devils would I were a devil To live and burn in everlasting fire So I might have your company in hell But to torment

beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace Were it not sinful then striving to mend To mar the subject that before was well For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell And more much more than in my verse can sit Your own glass shows you when you look in it 104 To me fair friend you never can be old For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such seems your beauty still three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers pride Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was beautys summer dead105 Let not my love be called idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my songs and praises be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined One thing expressing leaves out difference Fair kind and true is all my argument Fair kind and true varying to other words And in this change is my invention spent Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords Fair kind and true have often lived alone Which three till now never kept seat in one 106 When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they looked but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we which now behold these present days Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 107 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come Can yet the lease of my true love control Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured And the sad augurs mock their own presage Incertainties now crown themselves assured And peace proclaims olives of endless age Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes And thou in this shalt find thy monument When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 108 Whats in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit Whats new to speak what now to register That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine I must each day say oer the very same Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name So that eternal love in loves fresh case Weighs not the dust and injury of age Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place But makes antiquity for aye his page Finding the first conceit of love there bred Where time and outward form would show it dead 109 O never say that I was false of heart Though absence seemed my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that travels I return again Just to the time not with the time exchanged So that my self bring water for my stain Never believe though in my nature reigned All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood That it could so preposterously be stained To leave for nothing all thy sum of good For nothing this wide universe I call Save thou my rose in it thou art my all 110 Alas tis true I have gone here and there And made my self a motley to the view Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear Made old offences of affections new Most true it is that I have looked on truth Askance and strangely but by all above These blenches gave my heart another youth And worse essays proved thee my best of love Now all is done have what shall have no end Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof to try an older friend A god in love to whom I am confined Then give me welcome next my heaven the best Even to thy pure and most most loving breast 111 O for my sake do you with Fortune chide The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds Thence comes it that my name receives a brand And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in like the dyers hand Pity me then and wish I were renewed Whilst like a willing patient I will drink Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection No bitterness that I will bitter think Nor double penance to correct correction Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me 112 Your love and pity doth th impression fill Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow For what care I who calls me well or ill So you oergreen my bad my good allow You are my all the world and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue None else to me nor I to none alive That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others voices that my adders sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are Mark how with my neglect I do dispense You are so strongly in my purpose bred That all the world besides methinks are dead 113 Since I left you mine eye is in my mind And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function and is partly blind Seems seeing but effectually is out For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch Of his quick objects hath the mind no part Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight The most sweet favour or deformedst creature The mountain or the sea the day or night The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature Incapable of more replete with you My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue 114 Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true And that your love taught it this alchemy To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble Creating every bad a perfect best As fast as objects to his beams assemble O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing And my great mind most kingly drinks it up Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing And to his palate doth prepare the cup If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin 115 Those lines that I before have writ do lie Even those that said I could not love you dearer Yet then my judgement knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer But reckoning time whose millioned accidents Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents Divert strong minds to the course of altring things Alas why fearing of times tyranny Might I not then say Now I love you best When I was certain oer incertainty Crowning the present doubting of the rest Love is a babe then might I not say so To give full growth to that which still doth grow 116 Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove O no it is an everfixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wandring bark Whose worths unknown although his height be taken Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickles compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ nor no man ever loved 117 Accuse me thus that I have scanted all Wherein I should your great deserts repay Forgot upon your dearest love to call Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day That I have frequent been with unknown minds And given to time your own dearpurchased right That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight Book both my wilfulness and errors down And on just proof surmise accumulate Bring me within the level of your frown But shoot not at me in your wakened hate Since my appeal says I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love 118 Like as to make our appetite more keen With eager compounds we our palate urge As to prevent our maladies unseen We sicken to shun sickness when we purge Even so being full of your neercloying sweetness To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness To be diseased ere that there was true needing Thus policy in love t anticipate The ills that were not grew to faults assured And brought to medicine a healthful state Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured But thence I learn and find the lesson true Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 119 What potions have I drunk of Siren tears Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears Still losing when I saw my self to win What wretched errors hath my heart committed Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever O benefit of ill now I find true That better is by evil still made better And ruined love when it is built anew Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater So I return rebuked to my content And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent 120 That you were once unkind befriends me now And for that sorrow which I then did feel Needs must I under my transgression bow Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel For if you were by my unkindness shaken As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime O that our night of woe might have remembered My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits And soon to you as you to me then tendered The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits But that your trespass now becomes a fee Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me 121 Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed When not to be receives reproach of being And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed Not by our feeling but by others seeing For why should others false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood Or on my frailties why are frailer spies Which in their wills count bad what I think good No I am that I am and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own I may be straight though they themselves be bevel By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown Unless this general evil they maintain All men are bad and in their badness reign 122 Thy gift thy tables are within my brain Full charactered with lasting memory Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to eternity Or at the least so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist Till each to razed oblivion yield his partOf thee thy record never can be missed That poor retention could not so much hold Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score Therefore to give them from me was I bold To trust those tables that receive thee more To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me 123 No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel nothing strange They are but dressings of a former sight Our dates are brief and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told Thy registers and thee I both defy Not wondring at the present nor the past For thy records and what we see doth lie Made more or less by thy continual haste This I do vow and this shall ever be I will be true despite thy scythe and thee 124 If my dear love were but the child of state It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered As subject to times love or to times hate Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered No it was builded far from accident It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls It fears not policy that heretic Which works on leases of shortnumbered hours But all alone stands hugely politic That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers To this I witness call the fools of time Which die for goodness who have lived for crime 125 Weret aught to me I bore the canopy With my extern the outward honouring Or laid great bases for eternity Which proves more short than waste or ruining Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet forgoing simple savour Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent No let me be obsequious in thy heart And take thou my oblation poor but free Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art But mutual render only me for thee Hence thou suborned informer a true soul When most impeached stands least in thy control 126 O thou my lovely boy who in thy power Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour Who hast by waning grown and therein showst Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure She may detain but not still keep her treasure Her audit though delayed answered must be And her quietus is to render thee 127 In the old age black was not counted fair Or if it were it bore not beautys name But now is black beautys successive heir And beauty slandered with a bastard shame For since each hand hath put on natures power Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower But is profaned if not lives in disgrace Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem At such who not born fair no beauty lack Slandering creation with a false esteem Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe That every tongue says beauty should look so 128 How oft when thou my music music playst Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst The wiry concord that mine ear confounds Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap To kiss the tender inward of thy hand Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait Making dead wood more blest than living lips Since saucy jacks so happy are in this Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss 129 Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action and till action lust Is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight Past reason hunted and no sooner had Past reason hated as a swallowed bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad Mad in pursuit and in possession so Had having and in quest to have extreme A bliss in proof and proved a very woe Before a joy proposed behind a dream All this the world well knows yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 130 My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun Coral is far more red than her lips red If snow be white why then her breasts are dun If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head I have seen roses damasked red and white But no such roses see I in her cheeks And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks I love to hear her speak yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound I grant I never saw a goddess go My mistress when she walks treads on the ground And yet by heaven I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare 131 Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel Yet in good faith some say that thee behold Thy face hath not the power to make love groan To say they err I dare not be so bold Although I swear it to my self alone And to be sure that is not false I swear A thousand groans but thinking on thy face One on anothers neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgements place In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds And thence this slander as I think proceeds 132 Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain Have put on black and loving mourners be Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east Nor that full star that ushers in the even Doth half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning eyes become thy face O let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace And suit thy pity like in every part Then will I swear beauty herself is black And all they foul that thy complexion lack 133 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me Ist not enough to torture me alone But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken And my next self thou harder hast engrossed Of him my self and thee I am forsaken A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee Perforce am thine and all that is in me 134 So now I have confessed that he is thine And I my self am mortgaged to thy will My self Ill forfeit so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still But thou wilt not nor he will not be free For thou art covetous and he is kind He learned but suretylike to write for me Under that bond that him as fist doth bind The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take Thou usurer that putst forth all to use And sue a friend came debtor for my sake So him I lose through my unkind abuse Him have I lost thou hast both him and me He pays the whole and yet am I not free 135 Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will And Will to boot and Will in overplus More than enough am I that vex thee still To thy sweet will making addition thus Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine Shall will in others seem right gracious And in my will no fair acceptance shine The sea all water yet receives rain still And in abundance addeth to his store So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill Think all but one and me in that one Will 136 If thy soul check thee that I come so near Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will And will thy soul knows is admitted there Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love Ay fill it full with wills and my will one In things of great receipt with case we prove Among a number one is reckoned none Then in the number let me pass untold Though in thy stores account I one must be For nothing hold me so it please thee hold That nothing me a something sweet to thee Make but my name thy love and love that still And then thou lovst me for my name is Will 137 Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes That they behold and see not what they see They know what beauty is see where it lies Yet what the best is take the worst to be If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks Be anchored in the bay where all men ride Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied Why should my heart think that a several plot Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face In things right true my heart and eyes have erred And to this false plague are they now transferred 138 When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although she knows my days are past the best Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed But wherefore says she not she is unjust And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is in seeming trust And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore I lie with her and she with me And in our faults by lies we flattered be 139 O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue Use power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies And therefore from my face she turns my foes That they elsewhere might dart their injuries Yet do not so but since I am near slain Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain140 Be wise as thou art cruel do not press My tonguetied patience with too much disdain Lest sorrow lend me words and words express The manner of my pitywanting pain If I might teach thee wit better it were Though not to love yet love to tell me so As testy sick men when their deaths be near No news but health from their physicians know For if I should despair I should grow mad And in my madness might speak ill of thee Now this illwresting world is grown so bad Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be That I may not be so nor thou belied Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide 141 In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes For they in thee a thousand errors note But tis my heart that loves what they despise Who in despite of view is pleased to dote Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted Nor tender feeling to base touches prone Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be Only my plague thus far I count my gain That she that makes me sin awards me pain 142 Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving O but with mine compare thou thine own state And thou shalt find it merits not reproving Or if it do not from those lips of thine That have profaned their scarlet ornaments And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine Robbed others beds revenues of their rents Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee Root pity in thy heart that when it grows Thy pity may deserve to pitied be If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide By selfexample mayst thou be denied 143 Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch One of her feathered creatures broke away Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face Not prizing her poor infants discontent So runst thou after that which flies from thee Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me And play the mothers part kiss me be kind So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will If thou turn back and my loud crying still 144 Two loves I have of comfort and despair Which like two spirits do suggest me still The better angel is a man right fair The worser spirit a woman coloured ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her foul pride And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell But being both from me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out 145 Those lips that Loves own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said I hate To me that languished for her sake But when she saw my woeful state Straight in her heart did mercy come Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was used in giving gentle doom And taught it thus anew to greet I hate she altered with an end That followed it as gentle day Doth follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away I hate from hate away she threw And saved my life saying not you 146 Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth My sinful earth these rebel powers array Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth Painting thy outward walls so costly gay Why so large cost having so short a lease Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend Shall worms inheritors of this excess Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss And let that pine to aggravate thy store Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross Within be fed without be rich no more So shall thou feed on death that feeds on men And death once dead theres no more dying then 147 My love is as a fever longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill Th uncertain sickly appetite to please My reason the physician to my love Angry that his prescriptions are not kept Hath left me and I desperate now approve Desire is death which physic did except Past cure I am now reason is past care And franticmad with evermore unrest My thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are At random from the truth vainly expressed For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright Who art as black as hell as dark as night 148 O me what eyes hath love put in my head Which have no correspondence with true sight Or if they have where is my judgement fled That censures falsely what they see aright If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote What means the world to say it is not so If it be not then love doth well denote Loves eye is not so true as all mens no How can it O how can loves eye be true That is so vexed with watching and with tears No marvel then though I mistake my view The sun it self sees not till heaven clears O cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find 149 Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not When I against my self with thee partake Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self alltyrant for thy sake Who hateth thee that I do call my friend On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan What merit do I in my self respect That is so proud thy service to despise When all my best doth worship thy defect Commanded by the motion of thine eyes But love hate on for now I know thy mind Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind 150 O from what power hast thou this powerful might With insufficiency my heart to sway To make me give the lie to my true sight And swear that brightness doth not grace the day Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds Who taught thee how to make me love thee more The more I hear and see just cause of hate O though I love what others do abhor With others thou shouldst not abhor my state If thy unworthiness raised love in me More worthy I to be beloved of thee 151 Love is too young to know what conscience is Yet who knows not conscience is born of love Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove For thou betraying me I do betray My nobler part to my gross bodys treason My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason But rising at thy name doth point out thee As his triumphant prize proud of this pride He is contented thy poor drudge to be To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side No want of conscience hold it that I call Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall 152 In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn In vowing new hate after new love bearing But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee When I break twenty I am perjured most For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee And all my honest faith in thee is lost For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness Or made them swear against the thing they see For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I To swear against the truth so foul a lie 153 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep A maid of Dians this advantage found And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valleyfountain of that ground Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love A dateless lively heat still to endure And grew a seething bath which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired The boy for trial needs would touch my breast I sick withal the help of bath desired And thither hied a sad distempered guest But found no cure the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes 154 The little Lovegod lying once asleep Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep Came tripping by but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire Which many legions of true hearts had warmed And so the general of hot desire Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed This brand she quenched in a cool well by Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual Growing a bath and healthful remedy For men diseased but I my mistress thrall Came there for cure and this by that I prove Loves fire heats water water cools not love THE END ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL Contents ACT I Scene I Rossillon A

is more miserable Thou art a slave whom Fortunes tender arm With favour never clasped but bred a dog Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded The sweet degrees that this brief world affords To such as may the passive drugs of it Freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself In general riot melted down thy youth In different beds of lust and never learned The icy precepts of respect but followed The sugared game before thee But myself Who had the world as my confectionary The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men At duty more than I could frame employment That numberless

understand thee Thou hadst some means to keep a dog APEMANTUS What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers TIMON Women nearest but menmen are the things themselves What wouldst thou do with the world Apemantus if it lay in thy power APEMANTUS Give it the beasts to be rid of the men TIMON Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts APEMANTUS Ay Timon TIMON A beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t attain to If thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner Wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert germane to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life All thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence What beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast And what beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation APEMANTUS If thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou mightst have hit upon it here The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts TIMON How has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city APEMANTUS Yonder comes a poet and a painter The plague of company light upon thee I will fear to catch it and give way When I know not what else to do Ill see thee again TIMON When there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome I had rather be a beggars dog than Apemantus APEMANTUS Thou art the cap of all the fools alive TIMON Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon APEMANTUS A plague on thee Thou art too bad to curse TIMON All villains that do stand by thee are pure APEMANTUS There is no leprosy but what thou speakst TIMON If I name thee Ill beat thee but I should infect my hands APEMANTUS I would my tongue could rot them off TIMON Away thou issue of a mangy dog Choler does kill me that thou art alive I swoon to see thee APEMANTUS Would thou wouldst burst TIMON Away thou tedious rogue I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee Throws a stone at him APEMANTUS Beast TIMON Slave APEMANTUS Toad TIMON Rogue rogue rogue I am sick of this false world and will love nought But even the mere necessities upont Then Timon presently prepare thy grave Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat Thy gravestone daily Make thine epitaph That death in

or forgotten SECOND GENTLEMAN After all this how did he bear himself FIRST GENTLEMAN When he was brought again to th bar to hear His knell rung out his judgement he was stirred With such an agony he

King the Queen Cardinal Beaufort Suffolk York Buckingham Salisbury and Warwick to the Parliament KING HENRY I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man Whateer occasion keeps him from us now QUEEN MARGARET Can you not see or will ye not observe The strangeness of his altered countenance With what a majesty he bears himself How insolent of late he is become How proud how peremptory and unlike himself We know the time since he was mild and affable And if we did but glance a faroff look Immediately he was upon his knee That all the court admired him for submission But meet him now and be it in the morn When everyone will give the time of day He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee Disdaining duty that to us belongs Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England First note that he is near you in descent And should you fall he is the next will mount Me seemeth then it is no policy Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your Highness Council By flattery hath he won the commons hearts And when he please to make commotion Tis to be feared they all will follow him Now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted Suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the Duke If it be fond can it a womans fear Which fear if better reasons can supplant I will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York Reprove my allegation if you can Or else conclude my words effectual SUFFOLK Well hath your highness seen into this Duke And had I first been put to speak my mind I think I should have told your graces tale The Duchess by his subornation Upon my life began her devilish practices Or if he were not privy to those faults Yet by reputing of his high descent As next the King he was successive heir And such high vaunts of his nobility Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess By wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep And in his simple show he harbours treason The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit CARDINAL Did he not contrary to form of law Devise strange deaths for small offences done YORK And did he not in his protectorship Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers pay in France and never sent it By means whereof the towns each day revolted BUCKINGHAM Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey KING HENRY My lords at once the care you have of us To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent From meaning treason to our royal person As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given To dream on evil or to work my downfall QUEEN MARGARET Ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance Seems he a dove His feathers are but borrowed For hes disposed as the hateful raven Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him For hes inclined as is the ravenous wolves Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit Take heed my lord the welfare of us all Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man Enter Somerset SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign KING HENRY Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France SOMERSET That all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you all is lost KING HENRY Cold news Lord Somerset but Gods will be done YORK Aside Cold news for me for I had hope of France As firmly as I hope for fertile England Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud And caterpillars eat my leaves away But I will remedy this gear ere long Or sell my title for a glorious grave Enter Gloucester GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the King Pardon my liege that I have staid so long SUFFOLK Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art I do arrest thee of high treason here GLOUCESTER Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush Nor change my countenance for this arrest A heart unspotted is not easily daunted The purest spring is not so free from mud As I am clear from treason to my sovereign Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty YORK Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France And being Protector stayed the soldiers pay By means whereof his highness hath lost France GLOUCESTER Is it but thought so What are they that think it I never robbed the soldiers of their pay Nor ever had one penny bribe from France So help me God as I have watched the night Ay night by night in studying good for England That doit that eer I wrested from the King Or any groat I hoarded to my use Be brought against me at my trial day No many a pound of mine own proper store Because I would not tax the needy commons Have I dispursed to the garrisons And never asked for restitution CARDINAL It serves you well my lord to say so much GLOUCESTER I say no more than truth so help me God YORK In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of That England was defamed by tyranny GLOUCESTER Why tis well known that whiles I was Protector Pity was all the fault that was in me For I should melt at an offenders tears And lowly words were ransom for their fault Unless it were a bloody murderer Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers I never gave them condign punishment Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortured Above the felon or what trespass else SUFFOLK My lord these faults are easy quickly answered But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself I do arrest you in his highness name And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal To keep until your further time of trial KING HENRY My Lord of Gloucester tis my special hope That you will clear yourself from all suspense My conscience tells me you are"

shepherd turned That a maidens heart hath burned Can a woman rail thus SILVIUS Call you this railing ROSALIND Why thy godhead laid apart Warrst thou with a womans heart Did you ever hear such railing Whiles the eye of man did woo me That could do no vengeance to me Meaning me a beast If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine Alack in me what strange effect Would they

pray you tell it OLIVER When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour and pacing through the forest Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy Lo what befell He threw his eye aside And mark what object did present itself Under an oak whose boughs were mossed with ageAnd high top bald with dry antiquity A wretched ragged man oergrown with hair Lay sleeping on his back about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself Who with her head nimble in threats approached The opening of his mouth But suddenly Seeing Orlando it unlinked itself And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush under which bushs shade A lioness with udders all drawn dry Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir For tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead This seen Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother his elder brother CELIA O I have heard him speak of that same brother And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men OLIVER And well he might so do For well I know he was unnatural ROSALIND But to Orlando did he leave him there Food to the sucked and hungry lioness OLIVER Twice did he turn his back and purposed so But kindness nobler ever than revenge And nature stronger than his just occasion Made him give battle to the lioness

but tis not I I do not shame To tell you what I was since my conversion So sweetly tastes being the thing I am ROSALIND But for the bloody napkin OLIVER By and by When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed As how I came into that desert place In brief he led me to the gentle Duke Who gave me fresh array and entertainment Committing me unto my brothers love Who led me instantly unto his cave There stripped himself and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away Which all this while had bled and now he fainted And cried in fainting upon Rosalind Brief I recovered him bound up his wound And after some small space being strong at heart He sent me hither stranger as I am To tell this story that you might excuse His broken promise and to give this napkin Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind Rosalind faints CELIA Why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede OLIVER Many will swoon when they do look on blood CELIA There is more in it CousinGanymede OLIVER Look he recovers ROSALIND I would I were at home CELIA Well lead you thither I pray you will you take him by the arm OLIVER Be of good cheer youth You a man You lack a mans heart ROSALIND I do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited Heighho OLIVER This was not counterfeit There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest ROSALIND Counterfeit I assure you OLIVER Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man ROSALIND So I do But i faith I should have been a woman by right CELIA Come you look paler and paler Pray you draw homewards Good sir go with us OLIVER That will I for I must bear answer back How you excuse my

where love reigns disturbing jealousy 649 Doth call himself affections sentinel Gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny And in a peaceful hour doth cry Kill kill 652 Distempring gentle love in his desire As air and water do abate the fire This sour informer this batebreeding spy This canker that eats up loves tender spring 656 This carrytale dissentious jealousy That sometime true news sometime false doth bring Knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear That if I love thee I thy death should fear 660 And more than so presenteth to mine eye The picture of an angry chafing boar Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie An image like thyself all staind with gore 664 Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head What should I do seeing thee so indeed That tremble at thimagination 668 The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed And fear doth teach it divination I prophesy thy death my living sorrow If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow 672 But if thou needs wilt hunt be ruld by me Uncouple at the timorous flying hare Or at the fox which lives by subtilty Or at the roe which no encounter dare 676 Pursue these fearful creatures oer the downs And on thy wellbreathd horse keep with thy hounds And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare Mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles 680 How he outruns the wind and with what care He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles The many musits through the which he goes Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes 684 Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell And sometime where earthdelving conies keep To stop the loud pursuers in their yell 688 And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer Danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear For there his smell with others being mingled 691 The hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled With much ado the cold fault cleanly out Then do they spend their mouths echo replies As if another chase were in the skies 696 By this poor Wat far off upon a hill Stands on his hinder legs with listning ear To hearken if his foes pursue him still Anon their loud alarums he doth hear 700 And now his grief may be compared well To one sore sick that hears the passing bell Then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch Turn and return indenting with the way 704 Each envious briar his weary legs do scratch Each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay For misery is trodden on by many And being low never relievd by any 708 Lie quietly and hear a little more Nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise To make thee hate the hunting of the boar Unlike myself thou hearst me moralize 712 Applying this to that and so to so For love can comment upon every woe Where did I leave No matter where quoth he Leave me and then the story aptly ends 716 The night is spent Why what of that quoth she I am quoth he expected of my friends And now tis dark and going I shall fall In night quoth she desire sees best of all 720 But if thou fall oh then imagine this The earth in love with thee thy footing trips And all is but to rob thee of a kiss 723 Rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn Now of this dark night I perceive the reason Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine 728 Till forging nature be condemnd of treason For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine Wherein she framd thee in high heavens despite To shame the sun by day and her by night 732 And therefore hath she bribd the destinies To cross the curious workmanship of nature To mingle beauty with infirmities And pure perfection with impure defeature 736 Making it subject to the tyranny Of mad mischances and much misery As burning fevers agues pale and faint Lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood 740 The marroweating sickness whose attaint Disorder breeds by heating of the blood Surfeits imposthumes grief and damnd despair Swear natures death for framing thee so fair 744 And not the least of all these maladies But in one minutes fight brings beauty under Both favour savour hue and qualities Whereat thimpartial gazer late did wonder 748 Are on the sudden wasted thawd and done As mountain snow melts with the midday sun Therefore despite of fruitless chastity Lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns 752 That on the earth would breed a scarcity And barren dearth of daughters and of sons Be prodigal the lamp that burns by night Dries up his oil to lend the world his light 756 What is thy body but a swallowing grave Seeming to bury that posterity Which by the rights of time thou needs must have If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity 760 If so the world will hold thee in disdain Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain So in thyself thyself art made away A mischief worse than civil homebred strife 764 Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay Or butcher sire that reeves his son of life Foul cankring rust the hidden treasure frets But gold thats put to use more gold begets 768 Nay then quoth Adon you will fall again Into your idle overhandled theme The kiss I gave you is bestowd in vain And all in vain you strive against the stream 772 For by this blackfacd night desires foul nurse Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues And every tongue more moving than your own 776 Bewitching like the wanton mermaids songs Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown For know my heart stands armed in mine ear And will not let a false sound enter there 780 Lest the deceiving harmony should run Into the quiet closure of my breast And then my little heart were quite undone In his bedchamber to be barrd of rest 784 No lady no my heart longs not to groan But soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone What have you urgd that I cannot reprove The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger 790 I hate not love but your device in love That lends embracements unto every stranger You do it for increase O strange excuse When reason is the bawd to lusts abuse 792 Call it not love for love to heaven is fled Since sweating lust on earth usurpd his name Under whose simple semblance he hath fed Upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame 796 Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves As caterpillars do the tender leaves Love comforteth like sunshine after rain But lusts effect is tempest after sun 800 Loves gentle spring doth always fresh remain Lusts winter comes ere summer half be done Love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies Love is all truth lust full of forged lies 804 More I could tell but more I dare not say The text is old the orator too green Therefore in sadness now I will away My face is full of shame my heart of teen 808 Mine ears that to your wanton talk attended Do burn themselves for having so offended With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace 811 Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast And homeward through the dark laund runs apace Leaves love upon her back deeply distressd Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky So glides he in the night from Venus eye 816 Which after him she darts as one on shore Gazing upon a late embarked friend Till the wild waves will have him seen no more Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend 820 So did the merciless and pitchy night Fold in the object that did feed her sight Whereat amazd as one that unaware Hath droppd a precious jewel in the flood 824 Or stonishd as nightwanderers often are Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood Even so confounded in the dark she lay Having lost the fair discovery of her way 828 And now she beats her heart whereat it groans That all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled Make verbal repetition of her moans Passion on passion deeply is redoubled 832 Ay me she cries and twenty times Woe woe And twenty echoes twenty times cry so She marking them begins a wailing note And sings extemporally a woeful ditty 836 How love makes young men thrall and old men dote How love is wise in folly foolish witty Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe And still the choir of echoes answer so 840 Her song was tedious and outwore the night For lovers hours are long though seeming short If pleasd themselves others they think delight In such like circumstance with such like sport 844 Their copious stories oftentimes begun End without audience and are never done For who hath she to spend the night withal But idle sounds resembling parasites 848 Like shrilltongud tapsters answering every call Soothing the humour of fantastic wits She says Tis so they answer all Tis so And would say after her if she said No 852 Lo here the gentle lark weary of rest From his moist cabinet mounts up on high And wakes the morning from whose silver breast The sun ariseth in his majesty 856 Who doth the world so gloriously behold That cedar tops and hills seem burnishd goldVenus salutes him with this fair good morrow Oh thou clear god and patron of all light 860 From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow The beauteous influence that makes him bright There lives a son that suckd an earthly mother May lend thee light as thou dost lend to other This said she hasteth to a myrtle grove 865 Musing the morning is so much oerworn And yet she hears no tidings of her love She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn 868 Anon she hears them chant it lustily And all in haste she coasteth to the cry And as she runs the bushes in the way Some catch her by the neck some kiss her face 872 Some twine about her thigh to make her stay She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace Like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake 876 By this she hears the hounds are at a bay Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder Wreathd up in fatal folds just in his way The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder 880 Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds Appals her senses and her spirit confounds For now she knows it is no gentle chase But the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud 884 Because the cry remaineth in one place Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud Finding their enemy to be so curst They all strain courtsy who shall cope him first 888 This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear Through which it enters to surprise her heart Who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear With coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part 892 Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield They basely fly and dare not stay the field Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy Till cheering up her senses sore dismayd 896 She tells them tis a causeless fantasy And childish error that they are afraid Bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more And with that word she spied the hunted boar 900 Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red Like milk and blood being mingled both together A second fear through all her sinews spread Which madly hurries her she knows not whither 904 This way she runs and now she will no further But back retires to rate the boar for murther A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways She treads the path that she untreads again 908 Her more than haste is mated with delays Like the proceedings of a drunken brain Full of respects yet naught at all respecting In hand with all things naught at all effecting Here kenneld in a brake she finds a hound 913 And asks the weary caitiff for his master And there another licking of his wound Gainst venomd sores the only sovereign plaster 916 And here she meets another sadly scowling To whom she speaks and he replies with howling When he hath ceasd his illresounding noise Another flapmouthd mourner black and grim 920 Against the welkin volleys out his voice Another and another answer him Clapping their proud tails to the ground below Shaking their scratchd ears bleeding as they go Look how the worlds poor people are amazed 925 At apparitions signs and prodigies Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed Infusing them with dreadful prophecies 928 So she at these sad signs draws up her breath And sighing it again exclaims on death Hardfavourd tyrant ugly meagre lean 931 Hateful divorce of love thus chides she death Grimgrinning ghost earths worm what dost thou mean To stifle beauty and to steal his breath Who when he livd his breath and beauty set Gloss on the rose smell to the violet 936 If he be dead O no it cannot be Seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it O yes it may thou hast no eyes to see But hatefully at random dost thou hit 940 Thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infants heart Hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke And hearing him thy power had lost his power 944 The destinies will curse thee for this stroke They bid thee crop a weed thou pluckst a flower Loves golden arrow at him should have fled And not deaths ebon dart to strike him dead 948 Dost thou drink tears that thou provokst such weeping What may a heavy groan advantage thee Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see 952 Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour Since her best work is ruind with thy rigour Here overcome as one full of despair She vaild her eyelids who like sluices stoppd 956 The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair In the sweet channel of her bosom droppd But through the floodgates breaks the silver rain And with his strong course opens them again 960 O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow Her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye Both crystals where they viewd each others sorrow Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry 964 But like a stormy day now wind now rain Sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again Variable passions throng her constant woe As striving who should best become her grief 968 All entertaind each passion labours so That every present sorrow seemeth chief But none is best then join they all together Like many clouds consulting for foul weather 972 By this far off she hears some huntsman holla A nurses song neer pleasd her babe so well The dire imagination she did follow This sound of hope doth labour to expel 976 For now reviving joy bids her rejoice And flatters her it is Adonis voice Whereat her tears began to turn their tide Being prisond in her eye like pearls in glass 980 Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside Which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground Who is but drunken when she seemeth drownd O hardbelieving love how strange it seems 985 Not to believe and yet too credulous Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes Despair and hope make thee ridiculous 988 The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought Adonis lives and death is not to blame 992 It was not she that calld him all to naught Now she adds honours to his hateful name She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings Imperious supreme of all mortal things 996 No no quoth she sweet death I did but jest Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear Whenas I met the boar that bloody beast Which knows no pity but is still severe 1000 Then gentle shadowtruth I must confess I raild on thee fearing my loves decease Tis not my fault the boar provokd my tongue Be wreakd on him invisible commander 1004 Tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong I did but act hes author of my slander Grief hath two tongues and never woman yet Could rule them both without ten womens wit Thus hoping that Adonis is alive 1009 Her rash suspect she doth extenuate And that his beauty may the better thrive With death she humbly doth insinuate 1012 Tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories His victories his triumphs and his glories O love quoth she how much a fool was I To be of such a weak and silly mind 1016 To wail his death who lives and must not die Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind For he being dead with him is beauty slain And beauty dead black Chaos comes again 1020 Fie fie fond love thou art as full of fear As one with treasure laden hemmd with thieves Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves 1024 Even at this word she hears a merry horn Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn As falcon to the lure away she flies The grass stoops not she treads on it so light 1028 And in her haste unfortunately spies The foul boars conquest on her fair delight Which seen her eyes as murderd with the view Like stars ashamd of day themselves withdrew Or as the snail whose tender horns being hit 1033 Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain And there all smotherd up in shade doth sit Long after fearing to creep forth again 1036 So at his bloody view her eyes are fled Into the deep dark cabins of her head Where they resign their office and their light To the disposing of her troubled brain 1040 Who bids them still consort with ugly night And never wound the heart with looks again Who like a king perplexed in his throne By their suggestion gives a deadly groan 1044 Whereat each tributary subject quakes As when the wind imprisond in the ground Struggling for passage earths foundation shakes Which with cold terror doth mens minds confound This mutiny each part doth so surprise 1049 That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes And being opend threw unwilling light Upon the wide wound that the boar had trenchd In his soft flank whose wonted lily white 1053 With purple tears that his wound wept was drenchd No flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed But stole his blood and seemd with him to bleed This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth 1057 Over one shoulder doth she hang her head Dumbly she passions franticly she doteth She thinks he could not die he is not dead 1060 Her voice is stoppd her joints forget to bow Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three And then she reprehends her mangling eye 1065 That makes more gashes where no breach should be His face seems twain each several limb is doubled For oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled My tongue cannot express my grief for one 1069 And yet quoth she behold two Adons dead My sighs are blown away my salt tears gone Mine eyes are turnd to fire my heart to lead 1072 Heavy hearts lead melt at mine eyes red fire So shall I die by drops of hot desire Alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost What face remains alive thats worth the viewing Whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast Of things long since or anything ensuing 1078 The flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim But true sweet beauty livd and died with him Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear 1081 Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you Having no fair to lose you need not fear The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you But when Adonis livd sun and sharp air 1085 Lurkd like two thieves to rob him of his fair And therefore would he put his bonnet on Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep 1088 The wind would blow it off and being gone Play with his locks then would Adonis weepAnd straight in pity of his tender years They both would strive who first should dry his tears To see his face the lion walkd along 1093 Behind some hedge because he would not fear him To recreate himself when he hath sung The tiger would be tame and gently hear him 1096 If he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey And never fright the silly lamb that day When he beheld his shadow in the brook The fishes spread on it their golden gills 1100 When he was by the birds such pleasure took That some would sing some other in their bills Would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries He fed them with his sight they him with berries But this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar 1105 Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave Neer saw the beauteous livery that he wore Witness the entertainment that he gave 1108 If he did see his face why then I know He thought to kiss him and hath killd him so Tis true tis true thus was Adonis slain He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear 1112 Who did not whet his teeth at him again But by a kiss thought to persuade him there And nuzzling in his flank the loving swine Sheathd unaware the tusk in his soft groin 1116 Had I been toothd like him I must confess With kissing him I should have killd him first But he is dead and never did he bless My youth with his the more am I accurst 1120 With this she falleth in the place she stood And stains her face with his congealed blood She looks upon his lips and they are pale She takes him by the hand and that is cold 1124 She whispers in his ears a heavy tale As if they heard the woeful words she told She lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes Where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies Two glasses where herself herself beheld 1129 A thousand times and now no more reflect Their virtue lost wherein they late excelld And every beauty robbd of his effect 1132 Wonder of time quoth she this is my spite That thou being dead the day should yet be light Since thou art dead lo here I prophesy Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend 1136 It shall be waited on with jealousy Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end Neer settled equally but high or low That all loves pleasure shall not match his woe It shall be fickle false and full of fraud 1141 Bud and be blasted in a breathing while The bottom poison and the top oerstrawd With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile 1144 The strongest body shall it make most weak Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak It shall be sparing and too full of riot Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures 1148 The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet Pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures It shall be raging mad and silly mild Make the young old the old become a child 1152 It shall suspect where is no cause of fear It shall not fear where it should most mistrust It shall be merciful and too severe And most deceiving when it seems most just 1156 Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward Put fear to valour courage to the coward It shall be cause of war and dire events And set dissension twixt the son and sire 1160 Subject and servile to all discontents As dry combustious matter is to fire Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy They that love best their love shall not enjoy 1164 By this the boy that by her side lay killd Was melted like a vapour from her sight And in his blood that on the ground lay spilld A purple flower sprung up chequerd with white 1168 Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood She bows her head the newsprung flower to smell Comparing it to her Adonis breath 1172 And says within her bosom it shall dwell Since he himself is reft from her by death She crops the stalk and in the breach appears Greendropping sap which she compares to tears Poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise Sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire For every little grief to wet his eyes To grow unto himself was his desire 1180 And so tis thine but know it is as good To wither in my breast as in his blood Here was thy fathers bed here in my breast Thou art the next of blood and tis thy right 1184 Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night There shall not be one minute in an hour Wherein I will not kiss my sweet loves flower Thus weary of the world away she hies 1189 And yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid Their mistress mounted through the empty skies In her light chariot quickly is conveyd 1192 Holding their course to Paphos where their queen Means to immure herself and not be seenTHE SONNETS 1 From fairest creatures we desire increase That thereby beautys rose might never die But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel Making a famine where abundance lies Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud buriest thy content And tender churl makst waste in niggarding Pity the world or else this glutton be To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee 2 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now Will be a tattered weed of small worth held Then being asked where all thy beauty lies Where all the treasure of thy lusty days To say within thine own deep sunken eyes Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise How much more praise deservd thy beautys use If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse Proving his beauty by succession thine This were to be new made when thou art old And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold 3 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother For where is she so fair whose uneared womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry Or who is he so fond will be the tomb Of his selflove to stop posterity Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime So thou through windows of thine age shalt see Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time But if thou live remembered not to be Die single and thine image dies with thee 4 Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend Upon thyself thy beautys legacy Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend And being frank she lends to those are free Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give Profitless usurer why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live For having traffic with thyself alone Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive Then how when nature calls thee to be gone What acceptable audit canst thou leave Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee Which used lives th executor to be 5 Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel For neverresting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where Then were not summers distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass Beautys effect with beauty were bereft Nor it nor no remembrance what it was But flowers distilled though they with winter meet Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet 6 Then let not winters ragged hand deface In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled That use is not forbidden usury Which happies those that pay the willing loan Thats for thyself to breed another thee Or ten times happier be it ten for one Ten times thyself were happier than thou art If ten of thine ten times refigured thee Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart Leaving thee living in posterity Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir 7 Lo in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head each under eye Doth homage to his newappearing sight Serving with looks his sacred majesty And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill Resembling strong youth in his middle age Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still Attending on his golden pilgrimage But when from highmost pitch with weary car Like feeble age he reeleth from the day The eyes fore duteous now converted are From his low tract and look another way So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son 8 Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy If the true concord of welltuned sounds By unions married do offend thine ear They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear Mark how one string sweet husband to another Strikes each in each by mutual ordering Resembling sire and child and happy mother Who all in one one pleasing note do sing Whose speechless song being many seeming one Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none 9 Is it for fear to wet a widows eye That thou consumst thyself in single life Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die The world will wail thee like a makeless wife The world will be thy widow and still weep That thou no form of thee hast left behind When every private widow well may keep By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it But beautys waste hath in the world an end And kept unused the user so destroys it No love toward others in that bosom sits That on himself such murdrous shame commits 10 For shame deny that thou bearst love to any Who for thyself art so unprovident Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many But that thou none lovst is most evident For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate That gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire O change thy thought that I may change my mind Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love Be as thy presence is gracious and kind Or to thyself at least kindhearted prove Make thee another self for love of me That beauty still may live in thine or thee 11 As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst In one of thine from that which thou departest And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase Without this folly age and cold decay If all were minded so the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away Let those whom nature hath not made for store Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die 12 When I do count the clock that tells the time And see the brave day sunk in hideous night When I behold the violet past prime And sable curls all silvered oer with white When lofty trees I see barren of leaves Which erst from heat did canopy the herd And summers green all girded up in sheaves Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard Then of thy beauty do I question make That thou among the wastes of time must go Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake And die as fast as they see others grow And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence 13 O that you were your self but love you are No longer yours than you yourself here live Against this coming end you should prepare And your sweet semblance to some other give So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination then you were Yourself again after yourselfs decease When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear Who lets so fair a house fall to decay Which husbandry in honour might uphold Against the stormy gusts of winters day And barren rage of deaths eternal cold O none but unthrifts dear my love you know You had a father let your son say so 14 Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck And yet methinks I have astronomy But not to tell of good or evil luck Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind Or say with princes if it shall go well By oft predict that I in heaven find But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive And constant stars in them I read such art As truth and beauty shall together thrive If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert Or else of thee this I prognosticate Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date 15 When I consider everything that grows Holds in perfection but a little moment That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows Whereon the stars in secret influence comment When I perceive that men as plants increase Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease And wear their brave state out of memory Then the conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you most rich in youth before my sight Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay To change your day of youth to sullied night And all in war with Time for love of you As he takes from you I engraft you new 16 But wherefore do not you a mightier way Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time And fortify yourself in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme Now stand you on the top of happy hours And many maiden gardens yet unset With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers Much liker than your painted counterfeit So should the lines of life that life repair Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen Neither in inward worth nor outward fair Can make you live yourself in eyes of men To give away yourself keeps yourself still And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill 17 Who will believe my verse in time to come If it were filled with your most high deserts Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life and shows not half your parts If I could write the beauty of your eyes And in fresh numbers number all your graces The age to come would say this poet lies Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces So should my papers yellowed with their age Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue And your true rights be termed a poets rage And stretched metre of an antique song But were some child of yours alive that time You should live twicein it and in my rhyme 18 Shall I compare thee to a summers day Thou art more lovely and more temperate Rough winds do shake the darling buds of MayAnd summers lease hath all too short a date Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines And often is his gold complexion dimmed And every fair from fair sometime declines By chance or natures changing course untrimmed But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade When in eternal lines to time thou growst So long as men can breathe or eyes can see So long lives this and this gives life to thee 19 Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws And make the earth devour her own sweet brood Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws And burn the longlived phoenix in her blood Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time To the wide world and all her fading sweets But I forbid thee one most heinous crime O carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen Him in thy course untainted do allow For beautys pattern to succeeding men Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong My love shall in my verse ever live young 20 A womans face with natures own hand painted Hast thou the master mistress of my passion A womans gentle heart but not acquainted With shifting change as is false womens fashion An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth A man in hue all hues in his controlling Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth And for a woman wert thou first created Till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting And by addition me of thee defeated By adding one thing to my purpose nothing But since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure 21 So is it not with me as with that muse Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse Who heaven it self for ornament doth use And every fair with his fair doth rehearse Making a couplement of proud compare With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare That heavens air in this huge rondure hems O let me true in love but truly write And then believe me my love is as fair As any mothers child though not so bright As those gold candles fixed in heavens air Let them say more that like of hearsay well I will not praise that purpose not to sell 22 My glass shall not persuade me I am old So long as youth and thou are of one date But when in thee times furrows I behold Then look I death my days should expiate For all that beauty that doth cover thee Is but the seemly raiment of my heart Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me How can I then be elder than thou art O therefore love be of thyself so wary As I not for my self but for thee will Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary As tender nurse her babe from f"

would speak with him Enter Jaques FIRST LORD He saves my labour by his own approach DUKE SENIOR Why how now monsieur What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company What you look merrily JAQUES A fool a fool I met a fool i th forest A motley fool A miserable world As I do live by food I met a fool Who laid him down and basked him in the sun And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms In good set terms and yet a motley fool Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune And then he drew a dial from his poke And looking on it with

shade of melancholy boughs Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have looked on better days If ever been where bells have knolled to church If ever sat at any good mans feast If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what tis to pity and be pitied Let gentleness my strong enforcement be In the which hope I blush and hide my sword DUKE SENIOR True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church And sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be ministered ORLANDO Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn And give it food There is an old poor man

waste till you return ORLANDO I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort Exit DUKE SENIOR Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in JAQUES All the worlds a stage And all the men and women merely players They have their exits and their entrances And one man in his time plays many parts His acts being seven ages At first the infant Mewling and puking in the nurses arms Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face creeping like snail Unwillingly to school And then the lover Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice In fair round belly with good capon lined With eyes severe and beard of formal cut Full of wise saws and modern instances And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon With spectacles on nose and pouch on side His youthful hose well saved a world too wide For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice Turning again toward childish treble pipes And whistles in his sound Last scene of all That ends this strange eventful history Is second childishness and mere oblivion Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything Enter Orlando bearing Adam DUKE SENIOR Welcome Set down your venerable burden And let him feed ORLANDO I thank you most for him ADAM So had you need I scarce can speak to thank you for

how like you this shepherds life Master Touchstone TOUCHSTONE Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherds life it is naught In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd CORIN No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and

philosopher Wast ever in court shepherd CORIN No truly TOUCHSTONE Then thou art damned CORIN Nay I hope TOUCHSTONE Truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all on one side CORIN For not being at

our ewes and their fells you know are greasy TOUCHSTONE Why do not your courtiers hands sweat And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow shallow A better instance I say Come CORIN Besides our hands are hard TOUCHSTONE Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again A more sounder instance come CORIN And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The courtiers hands are perfumed with civet TOUCHSTONE Most shallow man Thou worms meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend Civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherd CORIN You have too courtly a wit for me Ill rest TOUCHSTONE Wilt thou rest damned God help thee shallow man God make incision in thee thou art rawCORIN Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck TOUCHSTONE That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle

must speak Sweet say on Enter Orlando and Jaques CELIA You bring me out Soft comes he not here ROSALIND Tis he Slink by and note him Rosalind and Celia step aside JAQUES I thank you for your company but good faith I had as lief have been myself alone ORLANDO And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you too for your society JAQUES God be wi you lets meet as little as we can ORLANDO I do desire we may be better strangers JAQUES I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks ORLANDO I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them illfavouredly JAQUES Rosalind is your loves name ORLANDO Yes just JAQUES I do not like her name ORLANDO There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened JAQUES What stature is she of ORLANDO Just as high as my heart JAQUES You are full of pretty answers Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them out of rings ORLANDO Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions JAQUES You have a nimble wit I think twas made of Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery ORLANDO I will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom I know most faults JAQUES The worst fault you have is to be in love ORLANDO Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue I am weary of you JAQUES By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found you ORLANDO He is drowned in the brook Look but in and you shall see him JAQUES There I shall see mine own figure ORLANDO Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher JAQUES Ill tarry no longer with you Farewell good Signior Love ORLANDO I am glad of your departure Adieu good Monsieur Melancholy Exit JaquesCelia and Rosalind come forward ROSALIND I will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him Do you hear forester ORLANDO Very well What would you ROSALIND I pray you what ist oclock ORLANDO You should ask me what time o day Theres no clock in the forest ROSALIND Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock ORLANDO And why not the swift foot of time Had not that been as proper ROSALIND By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with divers persons Ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal ORLANDO I prithee who doth he trot withal ROSALIND Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized If the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year ORLANDO Who ambles time withal ROSALIND With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These time ambles withal ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal ROSALIND With a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there ORLANDO Who stays it still withal ROSALIND With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves ORLANDO Where dwell you pretty youth ROSALIND With this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat ORLANDO Are you native of this place ROSALIND As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindledORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling ROSALIND I have been told so of many But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ROSALIND There were none principal They were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it ORLANDO I prithee recount some of them ROSALIND No I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind If I could meet that fancymonger I would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him ORLANDO I am he that is so loveshaked I pray you tell me your remedy ROSALIND There is none of my uncles marks upon you He taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner ORLANDO What were his marks ROSALIND A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have notbut I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue Then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man You are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other ORLANDO Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love ROSALIND Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired ORLANDO I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much ROSALIND Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so ROSALIND Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic And thus I cured him and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart that there shall not be one spot of love in t ORLANDO I would not be cured youth ROSALIND I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me ORLANDO Now by the faith of my love I will Tell me where it is ROSALIND Go with me to it and Ill show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you go ORLANDO With all my heart good youth ROSALIND

wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room Truly I would the gods had made thee poetical AUDREY I do not know what poetical is Is it honest in deed and word Is it a true thing TOUCHSTONE No truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign AUDREY Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical TOUCHSTONE I do truly for thou swearst to me thou art honest Now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst feign AUDREY Would you not have me honest TOUCHSTONE No truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar JAQUES Aside A material fool AUDREY Well I am not fair

foul TOUCHSTONE Well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may be I will marry thee And to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us JAQUES Aside I would fain see this meeting AUDREY Well the gods give us joy TOUCHSTONE Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts But what though Courage As horns are odious they are necessary It is said Many a man knows no end of his goods Right Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting Horns Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man therefore blessed No As a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor And by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want Enter Sir Oliver Martext Here comes Sir Oliver Sir Oliver Martext you are well met Will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel MARTEXT Is there none here to give the woman TOUCHSTONE I will not take her on gift of any man MARTEXT Truly she must be given or the

glad to see you Even a toy in hand here sir Nay pray be covered JAQUES Will you be married motley TOUCHSTONE As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his

you what marriage is This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp TOUCHSTONE Aside I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife JAQUES Go thou with me and let me counsel thee TOUCHSTONE Come sweet Audrey We must be married or we must live in bawdry Farewell good Master Oliver Not O sweet Oliver O brave Oliver Leave me not behind thee But Wind away

children ROSALIND I faith his hair is of a good colour CELIA An excellent colour Your chestnut was ever the only colour ROSALIND And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread CELIA He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana A nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them ROSALIND But why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not CELIA Nay certainly there is no truth in him ROSALIND Do you think so CELIA Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horsestealer but for his verity in love I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a wormeaten nut ROSALIND Not true in love CELIA Yes when he is in but I think he is not in ROSALIND You have heard him swear downright he was CELIA Was is not is Besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster They are both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father ROSALIND I met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him He asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando CELIA O thats a brave man He writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose But alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides Who comes hereEnter Corin CORIN Mistress and master you have oft enquired After the shepherd that complained of love Who you saw sitting by me on the turf Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress CELIA Well and what of him CORIN If you will see a pageant truly played Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain Go hence a little and I shall conduct you If you will mark it ROSALIND O come let us remove The sight of lovers feedeth those in love Bring us to this sight and you shall say Ill prove a busy actor in their play Exeunt SCENE V Another part of the Forest Enter Silvius and Phoebe SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe do not scorn me do not Phoebe Say that you love me not but say not so In bitterness The common executioner Whose heart th accustomed sight of death makes hard Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon Will you sterner be

power he would Have made them mules silenced their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms holding them In human action and capacity Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in their war who have their provand Only for bearing burdens and sore blows For sinking under them SICINIUS This as you say suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want If it be put upont and thats as easy As to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever Enter a Messenger BRUTUS Whats the matter MESSENGER You are sent for to the Capitol Tis thought That Martius shall be consul I have seen The dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs Upon him as he passed the nobles bended As to Joves statue and the Commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like BRUTUS Lets

FIRST OFFICER Come come They are almost here How many stand for consulships SECOND OFFICER Three they say but tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it FIRST OFFICER Thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury To report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it FIRST OFFICER No more of him hes a worthy man Make way They are coming A sennet Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the people Lictors before them Coriolanus Menenius

main point of this our aftermeeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our wellfound successes to report A little of that worthy work performed By Martius Caius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself Coriolanus sits FIRST

after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here SICINIUS We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly BRUTUS Which the rather We shall be blest to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at MENENIUS Thats off thats off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speak BRUTUS Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it MENENIUS He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speak Coriolanus rises and offers to go away Nay keep your place FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear What you have nobly done CORIOLANUS Your Honours pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them BRUTUS Sir I hope My words disbenched you not CORIOLANUS No sir Yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You soothed not therefore hurt not but your people I love them as they weigh MENENIUS Pray now sit down CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered Exit MENENIUS Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one ons ears to hear itProceed Cominius COMINIUS I shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver if it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him He bestrid An oerpressed Roman and i th Consuls view Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met And struck him on his knee In that days feats When he might act the woman in the scene He proved best man i th field and for his meed Was browbound with the oak His pupil age Manentered thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurched all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioles let me say I cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport As weeds before A vessel under sail so men obeyed And fell below his stem His sword Deaths stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was timed with dying cries Alone he entered The mortal gate o th city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioles like a planet Now alls his When by and by the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Requickened what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking oer the lives of men as if Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting MENENIUS Worthy man FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at And looked upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it MENENIUS Hes right noble Let him be called for FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus OFFICER He doth appear Enter Coriolanus MENENIUS The Senate Coriolanus are

I cannot Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds sake to give their suffrage Please you That I may pass this doing SICINIUS Sir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony MENENIUS Put them not tot Pray you go fit you to the custom and Take to you as your predecessors have Your honour with your form CORIOLANUS It is a part That I shall blush in acting and might well Be taken from the people BRUTUS Mark you that CORIOLANUS To brag unto them thus I did and thus Show them th unaching scars which I should hide As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only MENENIUS Do not stand upont We recommend to you tribunes of the people Our purpose to them and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour SENATORS To Coriolanus come all joy and honour Flourish cornets Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus BRUTUS You see how he intends to use the people SICINIUS May they perceives intent He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give BRUTUS Come well inform them Of our proceedings here On th marketplace I know they do attend us Exeunt SCENE III Rome The Forum Enter seven or eight Citizens FIRST CITIZEN Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him SECOND CITIZEN We may sir if we will THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them So if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude THIRD CITIZEN We have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o th compass SECOND CITIZEN Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would flyTHIRD CITIZEN Nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans will tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead But if it were at liberty twould sure southward SECOND CITIZEN Why that way THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife SECOND CITIZEN You are never without your tricks You may you may THIRD CITIZEN Are you all resolved to give your voices But thats no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility with Menenius Here he comes and in the gown of humility Mark his behaviour We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes Hes to make his requests by particulars wherein everyone of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues Therefore follow me and Ill direct you how you shall go by him ALL Content content Exeunt MENENIUS O sir you are not right Have you not known The worthiest men have donet CORIOLANUS What must I say I pray sirplague upont I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace Look sir my wounds I got them in my countrys service when Some certain of your brethren roared and ran From th noise of our own drums MENENIUS O me the gods You must not speak of that You must desire them To think upon you CORIOLANUS Think upon me Hang em I would they would forget me like the virtues Which our divines lose by em MENENIUS Youll mar all Ill leave you Pray you speak to em I pray you In wholesome manner

desire yet to trouble the poor with begging THIRD CITIZEN You must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you CORIOLANUS Well then I pray your price o th consulship FIRST CITIZEN The price is to ask it kindly CORIOLANUS Kindly sir I pray let me hat I have wounds to show you which shall be yours in privateYour good voice sir What say you SECOND CITIZEN You shall ha it worthy sir CORIOLANUS A match sir Theres in all two worthy voices begged I have your alms Adieu THIRD CITIZEN But this is something odd SECOND CITIZEN An twere to give againbut tis no matter Exeunt two citizens Enter two other Citizens CORIOLANUS Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown FOURTH CITIZEN You have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly CORIOLANUS Your enigma FOURTH CITIZEN You have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common people CORIOLANUS You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle And since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly That is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you I may be consul FIFTH CITIZEN We hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily FOURTH CITIZEN You have received many wounds for your country CORIOLANUS I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther BOTH CITIZENS The gods give you joy sir heartily Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices Better it is to die better to starve Than crave the hire which first we do deserve Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear Their needless vouches Custom calls me tot What custom wills in all things should we dot The dust on antique time would lie unswept And mountainous error be too highly heaped For truth to oerpeer Rather than fool it so Let the high office and the honour go To one that would do thus I am half through The one part suffered the other will I do Enter three Citizens more Here come more voices Your voices For your voices I have fought Watched for your voices for your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of for your voices have Done many things some less some more Your voices Indeed I would be consul SIXTH CITIZEN He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voice SEVENTH CITIZEN Therefore let him be consul The gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people ALL THREE CITIZENS Amen amen God save thee noble consul Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS Worthy voices Enter Menenius with Brutus and Sicinius MENENIUS You have stood your limitation and the Tribunes Endue you with the peoples voice Remains That in th official marks invested you Anon do meet the Senate CORIOLANUS Is this done SICINIUS The custom of

garments SICINIUS You may sir CORIOLANUS That Ill straight do and knowing myself again Repair to th Senate House MENENIUS Ill keep you companyWill you along BRUTUS We stay here for the people SICINIUS Fare you well Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius He has it now and by his looks methinks Tis warm at his heart BRUTUS With a proud heart he wore His humble weeds Will you dismiss the people Enter the Pebleians SICINIUS How now my masters have you chose this man FIRST CITIZEN He has our voices sir BRUTUS We pray the gods he may deserve your loves SECOND CITIZEN Amen sir To my poor unworthy notice He mocked us when he begged our voices THIRD CITIZEN Certainly he flouted us downright FIRST CITIZEN No tis his kind of speech He did not mock us SECOND CITIZEN Not one amongst us save yourself but says He used us scornfully He should have showed us His marks of merit wounds received fors country SICINIUS Why so he did I am sure ALL No no No man saw em THIRD CITIZEN He said he had wounds which he could show in private And with his hat thus waving it in scorn I would be consul says he aged custom But by your voices will not so permit me Your voices therefore When we granted that Here was I thank you for your voices Thank you Your most sweet voices Now you have left your voices I have no further with you Was not this mockery SICINIUS Why either were you ignorant to seet Or seeing it of such childish friendliness To yield your voices BRUTUS Could you not have told him As you were lessoned When he had no power But was a petty servant to the state He was your enemy ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I th body of the weal and now arriving A place of potency and sway o th state If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to th plebeii your voices might Be curses to yourselves You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love Standing your friendly lord SICINIUS Thus to have said As you were foreadvised had touched his spirit And tried his inclination from him plucked Either his gracious promise which you might As cause had called you up have held him to Or else it would have galled his surly nature Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught So putting him to rage You should have taen th advantage of his choler And passed him unelected BRUTUS Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies No heart among you Or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment SICINIUS Have you ere now denied the asker and now Again of him that did not ask but mock Bestow your suedfor tongues THIRD CITIZEN Hes not confirmed We may deny him yet SECOND CITIZEN And will deny him Ill have five hundred voices of that sound FIRST CITIZEN I twice five hundred and their friends to piece em BRUTUS Get you hence instantly and tell those friends They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so SICINIUS Let them assemble And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election Enforce his pride And his old hate unto you Besides forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed How in his suit he scorned you but your loves Thinking upon his services took from you Th apprehension of his present portance Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you BRUTUS Lay A fault on us your tribunes that we laboured No impediment between but that you must Cast your election on him SICINIUS Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections and that your minds Preoccupied with what you rather must do Than what you should made you against the grain To voice him consul Lay the fault on us BRUTUS Ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you How youngly he began to serve his country How long continued and what stock he springs of The noble house o th Martians from whence came That Ancus Martius Numas daughters son Who after great Hostilius here was king Of the same house Publius and Quintus were That our best water brought by conduits hither And Censorinus that was so surnamed And nobly named so twice being censor Was his great ancestor SICINIUS One thus descended That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place we did commend To your remembrances but you have found Scaling his present bearing with his past That hes your fixed enemy and revoke Your sudden approbation BRUTUS Say you neer had donet Harp on that stillbut by our putting on And presently when you have drawn your number Repair to th Capitol ALL We will so Almost all Repent in their electionExeunt Plebeians BRUTUS Let them go on This mutiny were better put in hazard Than stay past doubt for greater If as his nature is he fall in rage With their refusal both observe and answer The vantage of his anger SICINIUS To th Capitol come We

Saw you Aufidius LARTIUS On safeguard he came to me and did curse Against the Volsces for they had so vilely Yielded the town He is retired to Antium CORIOLANUS Spoke he of me LARTIUS He did my lord CORIOLANUS How What LARTIUS How often he had met you sword to sword That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes To hopeless restitution so he might Be

are the tribunes of the people The tongues o th common mouth I do despise them For they do prank them in authority Against all noble sufferance SICINIUS Pass no further CORIOLANUS Ha What is that

childrens voices FIRST SENATOR Tribunes give way He shall to the marketplace BRUTUS The people are incensed against him SICINIUS Stop Or all will fall in broil CORIOLANUS Are these your herd Must these have voices that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth Have you not set them on MENENIUS Be calm be calm CORIOLANUS It is a purposed thing and grows by plot To curb the will of the nobility Suffert and live with such as cannot rule Nor ever will be ruled BRUTUS Callt not a plot The people cry you mocked them and of late When corn was given them gratis you repined Scandaled the suppliants for the people called them Timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness CORIOLANUS Why this was known before

and Therein behold themselves I say again In soothing them we nourish gainst our senate The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition Which we ourselves have ploughed for sowed and scattered By mingling

patient as the midnight sleep By Jove twould be my mind SICINIUS It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is Not poison any further CORIOLANUS Shall remain Hear you this Triton of the minnows Mark you His absolute shall COMINIUS Twas from the canon CORIOLANUS Shall O good but most unwise patricians why You grave but reckless senators have you thus Given Hydra leave to choose an officer

if none awake Your dangerous lenity If you are learned Be not as common fools if you are not Let them have cushions by you You are plebeians If they be senators and they are no less When both your voices blended the greatst taste Most palates theirs They choose their magistrate And such a one as he who puts his shall His popular shall against a graver bench Than ever frowned in Greece By Jove himself It makes the consuls base And my soul aches To know when two authorities are up Neither supreme how soon confusion May enter twixt the gap of both and take The one by th other COMINIUS Well on to th marketplace CORIOLANUS Whoever gave that counsel to give forth The corn o th storehouse gratis as twas used Sometime in Greece MENENIUS Well well no more of that CORIOLANUS Though there the people had more absolute power I say they nourished disobedience fed The ruin of the state BRUTUS Why shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice CORIOLANUS Ill give my reasons More worthier than their voices They know the corn Was not our recompense resting well assured They neer did service fort Being pressed to th war Even when the navel of the state was touched They would not thread the gates This kind of service Did not deserve corn gratis Being i th war Their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed Most valour spoke not for them Th accusation Which they have often made against the Senate All cause unborn could never be the native Of our so frank donation Well what then How shall this bosom multitude digest The senates courtesy Let deeds express Whats like to be their words We did request it We are the greater poll and in true fear They gave us our demands Thus we debase The nature of our seats and make the rabble Call our cares fears which will in time Break ope the locks o th Senate and bring in The crows to peck the eagles MENENIUS Come enough BRUTUS Enough with overmeasure CORIOLANUS No take more What may be sworn by both divine and human Seal what I end withal This double worship Where one part does disdain with cause the other Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom Cannot conclude but by the yea and no Of general ignoranceit must omit Real necessities and give way the while To unstable slightness Purpose so barred it follows Nothing is done to purpose Therefore beseech you You that will be less fearful than discreet That love

The multitudinous tongue let them not lick The sweet which is their poison Your dishonour Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should becomet Not having the power to do the good it would For th ill which doth controlt BRUTUS Has said enough SICINIUS Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer As traitors do CORIOLANUS Thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee What should the people do with these bald tribunes On whom depending their obedience fails To th greater bench In a rebellion When whats not meet but what must be was law Then were they chosen In a better hour Let what is meet be said it must be meet And throw their power i th dust BRUTUS Manifest treason SICINIUS This a consul No BRUTUS The aediles ho Let him be apprehended Enter an Aedile SICINIUS Go call the

the city and to lay all flat SICINIUS What is the city but the people ALL PLEBEIANS True The people are the city BRUTUS By the consent of all we were established The peoples magistrates ALL PLEBEIANS You so remain MENENIUS And so are like to do COMINIUS That is the way to lay the city flat To bring the roof to the foundation And bury all which yet distinctly ranges In heaps and piles of ruin SICINIUS This deserves death BRUTUS Or let us stand to our authority Or let us lose it We do here pronounce Upon the part o th people in whose power We were elected theirs Martius is worthy Of present

SECOND SENATOR Get you gone CORIOLANUS Stand fast We have as many friends as enemies MENENIUS Shall it be put to that FIRST SENATOR The gods forbid I prithee noble friend home to thy house Leave us to cure this cause MENENIUS For tis a sore upon us You cannot tent yourself Begone beseech you COMINIUS Come sir along with us CORIOLANUS I would they were barbarians as they are Though in Rome littered not Romans as they are not Though calved i th porch o th Capitol MENENIUS Begone Put not your worthy rage into your tongue One time will owe another CORIOLANUS On fair ground I could beat forty of them MENENIUS I could myself Take up a brace o th best of them yea the two tribunes COMINIUS But now tis odds beyond arithmetic And manhood is called foolery when it stands Against a falling fabric Will you hence Before the tag return whose rage doth rend Like interrupted waters and oerbear What they are used to bear MENENIUS Pray you begone Ill try whether my old wit be in request With those that have but little This must be patched With cloth of any colour COMINIUS Nay come away Exeunt Coriolanus and Cominius PATRICIAN This man has marred his fortune MENENIUS His nature is too noble for the world He would not flatter Neptune for his trident Or Jove fors power to thunder His hearts his mouth What his breast forges that his tongue must vent And being angry does forget that ever He heard the name of death A noise within Heres goodly work PATRICIAN I would they were abed MENENIUS I would they were in Tiber What the vengeance Could he not speak em fair Enter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble again SICINIUS Where is this viper That would depopulate the city and Be every man himself MENENIUS You worthy tribunes SICINIUS He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock With rigorous hands He hath resisted law And therefore law shall scorn him further trial Than the severity of the public power Which he so sets at naught FIRST CITIZEN He shall well know The noble tribunes are the peoples mouths And we their hands ALL PLEBEIANS He shall sure ont MENENIUS Sir sir SICINIUS Peace MENENIUS Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt With modest warrant SICINIUS Sir how comest that

PLEBEIANS No no no no no MENENIUS If by the Tribunes leave and yours good people I may be heard I would crave a word or two The which shall turn you to no further harm Than so much loss of time SICINIUS Speak briefly then For we are peremptory to dispatch This viperous traitor To eject him hence Were but one danger and to keep him here Our certain death Therefore it is decreed He dies tonight MENENIUS Now the good gods forbid That our renowned Rome whose gratitude Towards her deserved children is enrolled In Joves own book like an unnatural dam Should now eat up her own SICINIUS Hes a disease that must be cut away MENENIUS O hes a limb that has but a disease Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy What has he done to Rome thats worthy death Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath By many an ouncehe dropt it for his country And what is left to lose it by his country Were to us all that dot and suffer it A brand to th end o th world SICINIUS This is clean cam BRUTUS Merely awry When he did love his country It honoured him MENENIUS The service of the foot Being once gangrened is not then respected For what before it was BRUTUS Well hear no more Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence Lest his infection being of catching nature Spread further MENENIUS One word more one word This tigerfooted rage when it shall find The harm of unscanned swiftness will too late Tie leaden pounds tos heels Proceed by process Lest partiesas he is belovedbreak out And sack great Rome with Romans BRUTUS If it were so SICINIUS What do ye talk Have we not had a taste of his obedience Our aediles smote Ourselves resisted Come MENENIUS Consider this he has been bred i th wars Since he could draw a sword and is ill schooled In

Tis promised in the charity of age Father she says though in me you behold The injury of many a blasting hour Let it not tell your judgement I am old Not age but sorrow over me hath power I might as yet have been a spreading flower Fresh to myself if I had selfapplied Love to myself and to no love beside But woe is me Too early I attended A youthful suit it was to gain my grace O one by natures outwards so commended That maidens eyes stuck over all his face Love lackd a dwelling and made him her place And when in his fair parts she did abide She was new lodgd and newly deified His browny locks did hang in crooked curls And every light occasion of the wind Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls Whats sweet to do to do will aptly find Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind For on his visage was in little drawn What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn Small show of man was yet upon his chin His phoenix down began but to appear Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin Whose bare outbraggd the web it seemed to wear Yet showd his visage by that cost more dear And nice affections wavering stood in doubt If best were as it was or best without His qualities were beauteous as his form For maidentongued he was and thereof free Yet if men movd him was he such a storm As oft twixt May and April is to see When winds breathe sweet unruly though they be His rudeness so with his authorizd youth Did livery falseness in a pride of truth Well could he ride and often men would say That horse his mettle from his rider takes Proud of subjection noble by the sway What rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes And controversy hence a question takes Whether the horse by him became his deed Or he his manage by th welldoing steed But quickly on this side the verdict went His real habitude gave life and grace To appertainings and to ornament Accomplishd in himself not in his case All aids themselves made fairer by their place Came for additions yet their purposd trim Piecd not his grace but were all gracd by him So on the tip of his subduing tongue All kind of arguments and question deep All replication prompt and reason strong For his advantage still did wake and sleep To make the weeper laugh the laugher weep He had the dialect and different skill Catching all passions in his craft of will That he did in the general bosom reign Of young of old and sexes both enchanted To dwell with him in thoughts or to remain In personal duty following where he haunted Consents bewitchd ere he desire have granted And dialogued for him what he would say Askd their own wills and made their wills obey Many there were that did his picture get To serve their eyes and in it put their mind Like fools that in th imagination set The goodly objects which abroad they find Of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them So many have that never touchd his hand Sweetly supposd them mistress of his heart My woeful self that did in freedom stand And was my own feesimple not in part What with his art in youth and youth in art Threw my affections in his charmed power Reservd the stalk and gave him all my flower Yet did I not as some my equals did Demand of him nor being desired yielded Finding myself in honour so forbid With safest distance I mine honour shielded Experience for me many bulwarks builded Of proofs newbleeding which remaind the foil Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil But ah Who ever shunnd by precedent The destind ill she must herself assay Or forced examples gainst her own content To put the bypassd perils in her way Counsel may stop a while what will not stay For when we rage advice is often seen By blunting us to make our wills more keen Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood That we must curb it upon others proof To be forbode the sweets that seems so good For fear of harms that preach in our behoof O appetite from judgement stand aloof The one a palate hath that needs will taste Though reason weep and cry It is thy last For further I could say This mans untrue And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling Heard where his plants in others orchards grew Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling Thought characters and words merely but artAnd bastards of his foul adulterate heart And long upon these terms I held my city Till thus he gan besiege me Gentle maid Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity And be not of my holy vows afraid Thats to ye sworn to none was ever said For feasts of love I have been calld unto Till now did neer invite nor never woo All my offences that abroad you see Are errors of the blood none of the mind Love made them not with acture they may be Where neither party is nor true nor kind They sought their shame that so their shame did find And so much less of shame in me remains By how much of me their reproach contains Among the many that mine eyes have seen Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed Or my affection put to th smallest teen Or any of my leisures ever charmed Harm have I done to them but neer was harmed Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free And reignd commanding in his monarchy Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and blushes aptly understood In bloodless white and the encrimsond mood Effects of terror and dear modesty Encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly And lo behold these talents of their hair With twisted metal amorously empleachd I have receivd from many a several fair Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd With th annexions of fair gems enrichd And deepbraind sonnets that did amplify Each stones dear nature worth and quality The diamond why twas beautiful and hard Whereto his invisd properties did tend The deep green emerald in whose fresh regard Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend The heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend With objects manifold each several stone With wit well blazond smild or made some moan Lo all these trophies of affections hot Of pensivd and subdued desires the tender Nature hath chargd me that I hoard them not But yield them up where I myself must render That is to you my origin and ender For these of force must your oblations be Since I their altar you empatron me O then advance of yours that phraseless hand Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise Take all these similes to your own command Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise What me your minister for you obeys Works under you and to your audit comes Their distract parcels in combined sums Lo this device was sent me from a nun Or sister sanctified of holiest note Which late her noble suit in court did shun Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote For she was sought by spirits of richest coat But kept cold distance and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love But O my sweet what labour ist to leave The thing we have not mastring what not strives Planing the place which did no form receive Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves She that her fame so to herself contrives The scars of battle scapeth by the flight And makes her absence valiant not her might O pardon me in that my boast is true The accident which brought me to her eye Upon the moment did her force subdue And now she would the caged cloister fly Religious love put out religions eye Not to be tempted would she be immurd And now to tempt all liberty procurd How mighty then you are O hear me tell The broken bosoms that to me belong Have emptied all their fountains in my well And mine I pour your ocean all among I strong oer them and you oer me being strong Must for your victory us all congest As compound love to physic your cold breast My parts had powr to charm a sacred nun Who disciplind and dieted in grace Believd her eyes when they tassail begun All vows and consecrations giving place O most potential love Vow bond nor space In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine For thou art all and all things else are thine When thou impressest what are precepts worth Of stale example When thou wilt inflame How coldly those impediments stand forth Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame Loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame And sweetens in the suffring pangs it bears The aloes of all forces shocks and fears Now all these hearts that do on mine depend Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine And supplicant their sighs to your extend To leave the battry that you make gainst mine Lending soft audience to my sweet design And credent soul to that strongbonded oath That shall prefer and undertake my troth This said his watry eyes he did dismount Whose sights till then were levelld on my face Each cheek a river running from a fount With brinish current downward flowed apace O how the channel to the stream gave grace Who glazd with crystal gate the glowing roses That flame through water which their hue encloses O father what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small orb of one particular tear But with the inundation of the eyes What rocky heart to water will not wear What breast so cold that is not warmed here O cleft effect Cold modesty hot wrath Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath For lo his passion but an art of craft Even there resolvd my reason into tears There my white stole of chastity I daffd Shook off my sober guards and civil fears Appear to him as he to me appears All melting though our drops this diffrence bore His poisond me and mine did him restore In him a plenitude of subtle matter Applied to cautels all strange forms receives Of burning blushes or of weeping water Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves In eithers aptness as it best deceives To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows That not a heart which in his level came Could scape the hail of his allhurting aim Showing fair nature is both kind and tame And veild in them did win whom he would maim Against the thing he sought he would exclaim When he most burned in heartwishd luxury He preachd pure maid and praisd cold chastity Thus merely with the garment of a grace The naked and concealed fiend he coverd That thunexperient gave the tempter place Which like a cherubin above them hoverd Who young and simple would not be so loverd Ay me I fell and yet do question make What I should do again for such a sake O that infected moisture of his eye O that false fire which in his cheek so glowd O that forcd thunder from his heart did fly O that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowd O all that borrowed motion seeming owed Would yet again betray the forebetrayed And new pervert a reconciled maid THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM I When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutord youth Unskilful in the worlds false forgeries Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although I know my years be past the best I smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue Outfacing faults in love with loves ill rest But wherefore says my love that she is young And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is a soothing tongue And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore Ill lie with love and love with me Since that our faults in love thus smotherd be II Two loves I have of comfort and despair That like two spirits do suggest me still My better angel is a man right fair My worser spirit a woman colourd ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her fair pride And whether that my angel be turnd fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell For being both to me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell The truth I shall not know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out III Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye Gainst whom the world could not hold argument Persuade my heart to this false perjury Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment A woman I forswore but I will prove Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee My vow was earthly thou a heavenly love Thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me My vow was breath and breath a vapour is Then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine Exhale this vapour vow in thee it is If broken then it is no fault of mine If by me broke what fool is not so wise To break an oath to win a paradise IV Sweet Cytherea sitting by a brook With young Adonis lovely fresh and green Did court the lad with many a lovely look Such looks as none could look but beautys queen She told him stories to delight his ear She showd him favours to allure his eye To win his heart she touchd him here and there Touches so soft still conquer chastity But whether unripe years did want conceit Or he refusd to take her figurd proffer The tender nibbler would not touch the bait But smile and jest at every gentle offer Then fell she on her back fair queen and toward He rose and ran away ah fool too froward V If love make me forsworn how shall I swear to love O never faith could hold if not to beauty vowed Though to myself forsworn to thee Ill constant prove Those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bowed Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend If knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire Thine eye Joves lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder Which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire Celestial as thou art O do not love that wrong To sing heavens praise with such an earthly tongue VI Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade When Cytherea all in love forlorn A longing tarriance for Adonis made Under an osier growing by a brook A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen Hot was the day she hotter that did look For his approach that often there had been Anon he comes and throws his mantle by And stood stark naked on the brooks green brim The sun lookd on the world with glorious eye Yet not so wistly as this queen on him He spying her bouncd in whereas he stood O Jove quoth she why was not I a flood VII Fair is my love but not so fair as fickle Mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty Brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittleSofter than wax and yet as iron rusty A lily pale with damask dye to grace her None fairer nor none falser to deface her Her lips to mine how often hath she joined Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing How many tales to please me hath she coined Dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings Her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings She burnt with love as straw with fire flameth She burnt out love as soon as straw outburneth She framd the love and yet she foild the framing She bade love last and yet she fell aturning Was this a lover or a lecher whether Bad in the best though excellent in neither VIII If music and sweet poetry agree As they must needs the sister and the brother Then must the love be great twixt thee and me Because thou lovst the one and I the other Dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch Upon the lute doth ravish human sense Spenser to me whose deep conceit is such As passing all conceit needs no defence Thou lovst to hear the sweet melodious sound That Phbus lute the queen of music makes And I in deep delight am chiefly drownd Whenas himself to singing he betakes One god is god of both as poets feign One knight loves both and both in thee remain IX Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love Paler for sorrow than her milkwhite dove For Adons sake a youngster proud and wild Her stand she takes upon a steepup hill Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds She silly queen with more than loves good will Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds Once quoth she did I see a fair sweet youth Here in these brakes deepwounded with a boar Deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth See in my thigh quoth she here was the sore She showed hers he saw more wounds than one And blushing fled and left her all alone X Sweet rose fair flower untimely pluckd soon vaded Pluckd in the bud and vaded in the spring Bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded Fair creature killd too soon by deaths sharp sting Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree And falls through wind before the fall should be I weep for thee and yet no cause I have For why thou leftst me nothing in thy will And yet thou leftst me more than I did crave For why I craved nothing of thee still O yes dear friend I pardon crave of thee Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me XI Venus with young Adonis sitting by her Under a myrtle shade began to woo him She told the youngling how god Mars did try her And as he fell to her she fell to him Even thus quoth she the warlike god embracd me And then she clippd Adonis in her arms Even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me As if the boy should use like loving charms Even thus quoth she he seized on my lips And with her lips on his did act the seizure And as she fetched breath away he skips And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure Ah that I had my lady at this bay To kiss and clip me till I run away XII Crabbed age and youth cannot live together Youth is full of pleasance age is full of care Youth like summer morn age like winter weather Youth like summer brave age like winter bare Youth is full of sport ages breath is short Youth is nimble age is lame Youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold Youth is wild and age is tame Age I do abhor thee youth I do adore thee O my love my love is young Age I do defy thee O sweet shepherd hie thee For methinks thou stayst too long XIII Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly A flower that dies when first it gins to bud A brittle glass thats broken presently A doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower Lost vaded broken dead within an hour And as goods lost are seld or never found As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh As flowers dead lie witherd on the ground As broken glass no cement can redress So beauty blemishd once for evers lost In spite of physic painting pain and cost XIV Good night good rest Ah neither be my share She bade good night that kept my rest away And daffd me to a cabin hangd with care To descant on the doubts of my decay Farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow Fare well I could not for I suppd with sorrow Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile In scorn or friendship nill I conster whether T may be she joyd to jest at my exile T may be again to make me wander thither Wander a word for shadows like myself As take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf Lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east My heart doth charge the watch the morning rise Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest Not daring trust the office of mine eyes While Philomela sits and sings I sit and mark And wish her lays were tuned like the lark For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty And drives away dark dreaming night The night so packd I post unto my pretty Heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight Sorrow changd to solace solace mixd with sorrow For why she sighd and bade me come tomorrow Were I with her the night would post too soon But now are minutes added to the hours To spite me now each minute seems a moon Yet not for me shine sun to succour flowers Pack night peep day good day of night now borrow Short night tonight and length thyself tomorrow XV It was a lordings daughter the fairest one of three That liked of her master as well as well might be Till looking on an Englishman the fairest that eye could see Her fancy fell aturning Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight To leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight To put in practice either alas it was a spite Unto the silly damsel But one must be refused more mickle was the pain That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain Alas she could not help it Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away Then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay For now my song is ended XVI On a day alack the day Love whose month was ever May Spied a blossom passing fair Playing in the wanton air Through the velvet leaves the wind All unseen gan passage find That the lover sick to death Wishd himself the heavens breath Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow Air would I might triumph so But alas my hand hath sworn Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn Vow alack for youth unmeet Youth so apt to pluck a sweet Thou for whom Jove would swear Juno but an Ethiope were And deny himself for Jove Turning mortal for thy love XVII My flocks feed not my ewes breed not My rams speed not all is amis Love is dying faiths defying Hearts denying causer of this All my merry jigs are quite forgot All my ladys love is lost God wot Where her faith was firmely fixd in love There a nay is placd without remove One silly cross wrought all my loss O frowning fortune cursed fickle dame For now I see inconstancy More in women than in men remain In black mourn I all fears scorn I Love hath forlorn me living in thrall Heart is bleeding all help needing O cruel speeding fraughted with gall My shepherds pipe can sound no deal My weathers bell rings doleful knell My curtal dog that wont to have playd Plays not at all but seems afraid With sighs so deep procures to weep In howling wise to see my doleful plight How sighs resound through heartless ground Like a thousand vanquishd men in bloody fight Clear wells spring not sweet birds sing not Green plants bring not forth their dye Herds stands weeping flocks all sleeping Nymphs black peeping fearfully All our pleasure known to us poor swains All our merry meetings on the plains All our evening sport from us is fled All our love is lost for love is dead Farewel sweet love thy like neer was For a sweet content the cause of all my woe Poor Corydon must live alone Other help for him I see that there is none XVIII Whenas thine eye hath chose the dame And stalld the deer that thou shouldst strike Let reason rule things worthy blame As well as fancy partial might Take counsel of some wiser head Neither too young nor yet unwed And when thou comst thy tale to tell Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk Least she some subtle practice smell A cripple soon can find a halt But plainly say thou lovst her well And set her person forth to sale What though her frowning brows be bent Her cloudy looks will calm ere night And then too late she will repent That thus dissembled her delight And twice desire ere it be day That which with scorn she put away What though she strive to try her strength And ban and brawl and say thee nay Her feeble force will yield at length When craft hath taught her thus to say Had women been so strong as men In faith you had not had it then And to her will frame all thy ways Spare not to spend and chiefly there Where thy desert may merit praise By ringing in thy ladys ear The strongest castle tower and town The golden bullet beats it down Serve always with assured trust And in thy suit be humble true Unless thy lady prove unjust Press never thou to choose a new When time shall serve be thou not slack To proffer though she put thee back The wiles and guiles that women work Dissembled with an outward show The tricks and toys that in them lurk The cock that treads them shall not know Have you not heard it said full oft A womans nay doth stand for nought Think women still to strive with men To sin and never for to saint There is no heaven by holy then When time with age shall them attaint Were kisses all the joys in bed One woman would another wed But soft enoughtoo muchI fear Lest that my mistress hear my song She will not stick to round me on th ear To teach my tongue to be so long Yet will she blush here be it said To hear her secrets so bewrayd XIX Live with me and be my love And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and valleys dales and fields And all the craggy mountains yield There will we sit upon the rocks And see the shepherds feed their flocks By shallow rivers by whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals There will I make thee a bed of roses With a thousand fragrant posies A cap of flowers and a kirtle Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle A belt of straw and ivy buds With coral clasps and amber studs And if these pleasures may thee move Then live with me and be my love Loves Answer If that the world and love were youngAnd truth in every shepherds tongue These pretty pleasures might me move To live with thee and be thy love XX As it fell upon a day In the merry month of May Sitting in a pleasant shade Which a grove of myrtles made Beasts did leap and birds did sing Trees did grow and plants did spring Everything did banish moan Save the nightingale alone She poor bird as all forlorn Leand her breast uptill a thorn And there sung the dolefullst ditty That to hear it was great pitty Fie fie fie now would she cry Tereu Tereu by and by That to hear her so complain Scarce I could from tears refrain For her griefs so lively shown Made me think upon mine own Ah thought I thou mournst in vain None takes pitty on thy pain Senseless trees they cannot hear thee Ruthless bears they will not cheer thee King Pandion he is dead All thy friends are lappd in lead All thy fellow birds do sing Careless of thy sorrowing Whilst as fickle fortune smiled Thou and I were both beguiled Every one that flatters thee Is no friend in misery Words are easy like the wind Faithful friends are hard to find Every man will be thy friend Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend But if store of crowns be scant No man will supply thy want If that one be prodigal Bountiful they will him call And with suchlike flattering Pity but he were a king If he be addict to vice Quickly him they will entice If to women he be bent They have at commandement But if Fortune once do frown Then farewell his great renown They that fawnd on him before Use his company no more He that is thy friend indeed He will help thee in thy need If thou sorrow he will weep If thou wake he cannot sleep Thus of every grief in heart He with thee doth bear a part These are certain signs to know Faithful friend from flattring foe THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE Let the bird of loudest lay On the sole Arabian tree Herald sad and trumpet be To whose sound chaste wings obey But thou shrieking harbinger Foul precurrer of the fiend Augur of the fevers end To this troop come thou not near From this session interdict Every fowl of tyrant wing Save the eagle featherd king Keep the obsequy so strict Let the priest in surplice white That defunctive music can Be the deathdivining swan Lest the requiem lack his right And thou trebledated crow That thy sable gender makst With the breath thou givst and takst Mongst our mourners shalt thou go Here the anthem doth commence Love and constancy is dead Phoenix and the turtle fled In a mutual flame from hence So they lovd as love in twain Had the essence but in one Two distincts division none Number there in love was slain Hearts remote yet not asunder Distance and no space was seen Twixt this turtle and his queen But in them it were a wonder So between them love did shine That the turtle saw his right Flaming in the phoenix sight Either was the others mine Property was thus appalled That the self was not the same Single natures double name Neither two nor one was called Reason in itself confounded Saw division grow together To themselves yet either neither Simple were so well compounded That it cried How true a twain Seemeth this concordant one Love hath reason reason none If what parts can so remain Whereupon it made this threne To the phoenix and the dove Cosupremes and stars of love As chorus to their tragic scene THRENOS Beauty truth and rarity Grace in all simplicity Here enclosd in cinders lie Death is now the phoenix nest And the turtles loyal breast To eternity doth rest Leaving no posterity Twas not their infirmity It was married chastity Truth may seem but cannot be Beauty brag but tis not she Truth and beauty buried be To this urn let those repair That are either true or fair For these dead birds sigh a prayer THE RAPE OF LUCRECE TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON and Baron of Titchfield The love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end whereof this pamphlet without beginning is but a superfluous moiety The warrant I have of your honourable disposition not the worth of my untutored lines makes it assured of acceptance What I have done is yours what I have to do is yours being part in all I have devoted yours Were my worth greater my duty would show greater meantime as it is it is bound to your Lordship to whom I wish long life still lengthened with all happiness Your Lordships in all duty WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE THE ARGUMENT Lucius Tarquinius for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus after he had caused his own fatherinlaw Servius Tullius to be cruelly murdered and contrary to the Roman laws and customs not requiring or staying for the peoples suffrages had possessed himself of the kingdom went accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome to besiege Ardea During which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius the kings son in their discourses after supper everyone commended the virtues of his own wife among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which everyone had before avouched only Collatinus finds his wife though it were late in the night spinning amongst her maids the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or in several disports Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory and his wife the fame At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucreces beauty yet smothering his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the morning speedeth away Lucrece in this lamentable plight hastily dispatched messengers one to Rome for her father another to the camp for Collatine They came the one accompanied with Junius Brutus the other with Publius Valerius and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause of her sorrow She first taking an oath of them for her revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and withal suddenly stabbed herself Which done with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins and bearing the dead body to Rome Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the people were so moved that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled and the state government changed from kings to consuls From the besieged Ardea all in post Borne by the trustless wings of false desire Lustbreathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host And to Collatium bears the lightless fire Which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire And girdle with embracing flames the waist Of Collatines fair love Lucrece the chaste Haply that name of chaste unhapply set This bateless edge on his keen appetite When Collatine unwisely did not let To praise the clear unmatched red and white Which triumphed in that sky of his delight Where mortal stars as bright as heavens beauties With pure aspects did him peculiar duties For he the night before in Tarquins tent Unlocked the treasure of his happy state What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent In the possession of his beauteous mate Reckning his fortune at such high proud rate That kings might be espoused to more fame But king nor peer to such a peerless dame O happiness enjoyed but of a few And if possessed as soon decayed and done As is the mornings silver melting dew Against the golden splendour of the sun An expired date cancelled ere well begun Honour and beauty in the owners arms Are weakly fortressed from a world of harms Beauty itself doth of itself persuade The eyes of men without an orator What needeth then apologies be made To set forth that which is so singular Or why is Collatine the publisher Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown From thievish ears because it is his own Perchance his boast of Lucrece sovreignty Suggested this proud issue of a king For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be Perchance that envy of so rich a thing Braving compare disdainfully did sting His highpitched thoughts that meaner men should vaunt That golden hap which their superiors want But some untimely thought did instigate His alltootimeless speed if none of those His honour his affairs his friends his state Neglected all with swift intent he goes To quench the coal which in his liver glows O rash false heat wrapped in repentant cold Thy hasty spring still blasts and neer grows old When at Collatium this false lord arrived Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame Within whose face beauty and virtue strived Which of them both should underprop her fame When virtue bragged beauty would blush for shame When beauty boasted blushes in despite Virtue would stain that oer with silver white But beauty in that white intituled From Venus doves doth challenge that fair field Then virtue claims from beauty beautys red Which virtue gave the golden age to gild Their silver cheeks and called it then their shield Teaching them thus to use it in the fight When shame assailed the red should fence the white This heraldry in Lucrece face was seen Argued by beautys red and virtues white Of eithers colour was the other queen Proving from worlds minority their right Yet their ambition makes them still to fight The sovereignty of either being so great That oft they interchange each others seat Their silent war of lilies and of roses Which Tarquin viewed in her fair faces field In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses Where lest between them both it should be killed The coward captive vanquished doth yield To those two armies that would let him go Rather than triumph in so false a foe Now thinks he that her husbands shallow tongue The niggard prodigal that praised her so In that high task hath done her beauty wrong Which far exceeds his barren skill to show Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise In silent wonder of stillgazing eyes This earthly saint adored by this devil Little suspecteth the false worshipperFor unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil Birds never limed no secret bushes fear So guiltless she securely gives good cheer And reverend welcome to her princely guest Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed For that he coloured with his high estate Hiding base sin in pleats of majesty That nothing in him seemed inordinate Save sometime too much wonder of his eye Which having all all could not satisfy But poorly rich so wanteth in his store That cloyed with much he pineth still for more But she that never coped with stranger eyes Could pick no meaning from their parling looks Nor read the subtle shining secrecies Writ in the glassy margents of such books She touched no unknown baits nor feared no hooks Nor could she moralize his wanton sight More than his eyes were opened to the light He stories to her ears her husbands fame Won in the fields of fruitful Italy And decks with praises Collatines high name Made glorious by his manly chivalry With bruised arms and wreaths of victory Her joy with heavedup hand she doth express And wordless so greets heaven for his success Far from the purpose of his coming thither He makes excuses for his being there No cloudy show of stormy blustring weather Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear Till sable Night mother of dread and fear Upon the world dim darkness doth display And in her vaulty prison stows the day For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed Intending weariness with heavy sprite For after supper long he questioned With modest Lucrece and wore out the night Now leaden slumber with lifes strength doth fight And every one to rest themselves betake Save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving The sundry dangers of his wills obtaining Yet ever to obtain his will resolving Though weakbuilt hopes persuade him to abstaining Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining And when great treasure is the meed proposed Though death be adjunct theres no death supposed Those that much covet are with gain so fond For what they have not that which they possess They scatter and unloose it from their bond And so by hoping more they have but less Or gaining more the profit of excess Is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain That they prove bankrout in this poorrich gain The aim of all is but to nurse the life With honour"

messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome His name is Balthazar I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant We turnd oer many books together He is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Graces request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial

Bellario PORTIA I did my lord DUKE You are welcome Take your place Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court PORTIA I am informed throughly of the cause Which is the merchant here And which the Jew DUKE Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth PORTIA Is your name Shylock SHYLOCK Shylock is my name PORTIA Of a strange nature is the suit you follow Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed To Antonio You stand within his danger do you not ANTONIO Ay so he says PORTIA Do you confess the bond ANTONIO I do PORTIA Then must the Jew be merciful SHYLOCK On what compulsion must I Tell me that PORTIA The quality of mercy is not straind It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath It is twice blest It blesseth him that gives and him that takes Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown His sceptre shows the force of temporal power The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings But mercy is above this sceptred sway It is enthroned in the hearts of kings It is an attribute to God himself And earthly power doth then show likest Gods When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew Though justice be thy plea consider this That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation We do pray for mercy And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there SHYLOCK My deeds upon my head I crave the law The penalty and forfeit of my bond PORTIA Is he not able to discharge the money BASSANIO Yes here I tender it for him in the court Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times oer On forfeit of my hands my head my heart If this will not suffice it must appear That malice bears down truth And I beseech you Wrest once the law to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And curb this cruel devil of his will PORTIA It must not be there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established Twill be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state It cannot be SHYLOCK A Daniel come to judgment Yea a Daniel O wise young judge how I do honour thee PORTIA I pray you let me look upon the bond SHYLOCK Here tis most reverend doctor here it is PORTIA Shylock theres thrice thy money offered thee SHYLOCK An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven Shall I lay perjury upon my soul No not for Venice PORTIA Why this bond is forfeit And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchants heart Be merciful Take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond SHYLOCK When it is paid according to the tenour It doth appear you are a worthy judge You know the law your exposition Hath been most sound I charge you by the law Whereof you are a welldeserving pillar Proceed to judgment By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me I stay here on my bond ANTONIO Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment PORTIA Why then thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knife SHYLOCK O noble judge O excellent young man PORTIA For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty Which here appeareth due upon the bond SHYLOCK Tis very true O wise and upright judge How much more elder art thou than thy looks PORTIA Therefore lay bare your bosom SHYLOCK Ay his breast So says the bond doth it not noble judge Nearest his heart those are the very words PORTIA It is so Are there balance here to weigh The flesh SHYLOCK I have them ready PORTIA Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death SHYLOCK Is it so nominated in the bond PORTIA It is not so expressd but what of that Twere good you do so much for charity SHYLOCK I cannot find it tis not in the bond PORTIA You merchant have you anything to say ANTONIO But little I am armd and well prepard Give me your hand Bassanio Fare you well Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty from which lingring penance Of such misery doth she cut me off Commend me to your honourable wife Tell her the process of Antonios end Say how I lovd you speak me fair in death And when the tale is told bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt For if the Jew do cut but deep enough Ill pay it instantly with all my heart BASSANIO Antonio I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself But life itself my wife and all the world Are not with me esteemd above thy life I would lose all ay sacrifice them all Here to this devil to deliver you PORTIA Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer GRATIANO I have a wife who I protest I love I would she were in heaven so she couldEntreat some power to change this currish Jew NERISSA Tis well you offer it behind her back The wish would make else an unquiet house SHYLOCK These be the Christian husbands I have a daughter Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband rather than a Christian We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence PORTIA A pound of that same merchants flesh is thine The court awards it and the law doth give it SHYLOCK Most rightful judge PORTIA And you must cut this flesh from off his breast The law allows it and the court awards it SHYLOCK Most learned judge A sentence Come prepare PORTIA Tarry a little there is something else This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood The words expressly are a pound of flesh Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice GRATIANO O upright judge Mark Jew O learned judge SHYLOCK Is that the law PORTIA Thyself shalt see the act For as thou urgest justice be assurd Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirst GRATIANO O learned judge Mark Jew a learned judge SHYLOCK I take this offer then Pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go BASSANIO Here is the money PORTIA Soft The Jew shall have all justice Soft no haste He shall have nothing but the penalty GRATIANO O Jew an upright judge a learned judge PORTIA Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh if thou takst more Or less than a just pound be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate GRATIANO A second Daniel a Daniel Jew Now infidel I have you on the hip PORTIA Why doth the Jew pause Take thy forfeiture SHYLOCK Give me my principal and let me go BASSANIO I have it ready for thee Here it is PORTIA He hath refusd it in the open court He shall have merely justice and his bond GRATIANO A Daniel still say I a second Daniel I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word SHYLOCK Shall I not have barely my principal PORTIA Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril Jew SHYLOCK Why then the devil give him good of it Ill stay no longer question PORTIA Tarry Jew The law hath yet another hold on you It is enacted in the laws of Venice If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offenders life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only gainst all other voice In which predicament I say thou standst For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant and thou hast incurrd The danger formerly by me rehearsd Down therefore and beg mercy of the Duke GRATIANO Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state Thou hast not left the value of a cord Therefore thou must be hangd at the states charge DUKE That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it For half thy wealth it is Antonios The other half comes to the general state Which humbleness may drive unto a fine PORTIA Ay for the state not for Antonio SHYLOCK Nay take my life and all pardon not that You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live PORTIA What mercy can you render him Antonio GRATIANO A halter gratis nothing else for Gods sake ANTONIO So please my lord the Duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter Two things provided more that for this favour He presently become a Christian The other that he do record a gift Here in the

SHYLOCK I am content PORTIA Clerk draw a deed of gift SHYLOCK I pray you give me leave to go from hence I am not well send the deed after me And I will sign it DUKE Get thee gone but do it GRATIANO In christning shalt thou have two godfathers Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more To bring thee to the gallows not to the font Exit Shylock DUKE Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner

For in my mind you are much bound to him Exeunt Duke and his train BASSANIO Most worthy gentleman I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties in lieu whereof

the house your mistress is at hand And bring your music forth into the air Exit StephanoHow sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold Theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst But in his motion like an angel sings Still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins Such harmony is in immortal souls But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it Enter Musicians Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear And draw her home with music Music JESSICA I am never merry when I hear sweet music LORENZO The reason is your spirits are attentive For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud Which is the hot condition of their blood If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound Or any air of music touch their ears You shall perceive them make a mutual stand Their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods Since naught so stockish hard and full of rage But music for the time doth change his nature The man that hath no music in himself Nor is not movd with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus Let no such man be trusted Mark the music Enter Portia and Nerissa PORTIA That light we see is burning in my hall How far that little candle throws his beams So shines a good deed in a naughty world NERISSA When the moon shone we did not see the candle PORTIA So doth the greater glory dim the less A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by and then his state Empties itself as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters Music hark NERISSA It is your music madam of the house PORTIA Nothing is good I see without respect Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day NERISSA Silence bestows that virtue on it madam PORTIA The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended and I think The nightingale if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling would be thought No better a musician than the wren How many things by season seasond are To their right praise and true perfection Peace How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awakd Music ceases LORENZO That is the voice Or I am much deceivd of Portia PORTIA He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo By the bad voice LORENZO Dear lady welcome home PORTIA We have been praying for our husbands welfare Which speed we hope the better for our words Are they returnd LORENZO Madam they are not yet But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming PORTIA Go in Nerissa Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you A tucket sounds LORENZO Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet We are no telltales madam fear you not PORTIA This night methinks is but the daylight sick It looks a little paler Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid Enter Bassanio Antonio Gratiano and their Followers BASSANIO We should hold day with the Antipodes If you would walk in absence of the sun PORTIA Let me give light but let me not be light For a light wife doth make a heavy husband And never be Bassanio so for me But God sort all You are welcome home my lord BASSANIO I thank you madam Give welcome to my friend This is the man this is Antonio To whom I am so infinitely bound PORTIA You should in all sense be much bound to him For as I hear he was much bound for you ANTONIO No more than I am well acquitted of PORTIA Sir you are very welcome to our house It must appear in other ways than words Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy GRATIANO To Nerissa By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong In faith I gave it to the judges clerk Would he were gelt that had it for my part Since you do take it love so much at heart PORTIA A quarrel ho already Whats the matter GRATIANO About a hoop of gold a paltry ring That she did give me whose posy was For all the world like cutlers poetry Upon a knife Love me and leave me not NERISSA What talk you of the posy or the value You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death And that it should lie with you in your grave Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths You should have been respective and have kept it Gave it a judges clerk No Gods my judge The clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had it GRATIANO He will and if he live to be a man NERISSA Ay if a woman live to be a man GRATIANO Now by this hand I gave it to a youth A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy No higher than thyself the judges clerk A prating boy that beggd it as a fee I could not for my heart deny it him PORTIA You were to blameI must be plain with you To part so slightly with your wifes first gift A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it and here he stands I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief An twere to me I should be mad at it BASSANIO Aside Why I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it GRATIANO My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that beggd it and indeed Deservd it too And then the boy his clerk That took some pains in writing he beggd mine And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings PORTIA What ring gave you my lord Not that I hope which you receivd of me BASSANIO If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it it is gone PORTIA Even so void is your false heart of truth By heaven I will neer come in your bed Until I see the ring NERISSA Nor I in yours Till I again see mine BASSANIO Sweet Portia If you did know to whom I gave the ring If you did know for whom I gave the ring And would conceive for what I gave the ring And how unwillingly I left the ring When nought would be accepted but the ring You would abate the strength of your displeasure PORTIA If you had known the virtue of the ring Or half her worthiness that gave the ring Or your own honour to contain the ring You would not then have parted with the ring What man is there so much unreasonable If you had pleasd to have defended it With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony Nerissa teaches me what to believe Ill die fort but some woman had the ring BASSANIO No by my honour madam by my soul No woman had it but a civil doctor Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And beggd the ring the which I did deny him And sufferd him to go displeasd away Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady I was enforcd to send it after him I was beset with shame and courtesy My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it Pardon me good lady For by these blessed candles of the night Had you been there I think you would have beggd The ring of me to give the worthy doctor PORTIA Let not that doctor eer come near my house Since he hath got the jewel that I loved And that which you did swear to keep for me I will become as liberal as you Ill not deny him anything I have No not my body nor my husbands bed Know him I shall I am well sure of it Lie not a night from home Watch me like Argus If you do not if I be left alone Now by mine honour which is yet mine own Ill have that doctor for mine bedfellow NERISSA And I his clerk Therefore be well advisd How you do leave me to mine own protection GRATIANO Well do you so Let not me take him then For if I do Ill mar the young clerks pen ANTONIO I am th unhappy subject of these quarrels PORTIA Sir grieve not you You are welcome notwithstanding BASSANIO Portia forgive me this enforced wrong And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself PORTIA Mark you but that In both my eyes he doubly sees himself In each eye one Swear by your double self And theres an oath of credit BASSANIO Nay but hear me Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee ANTONIO I once did lend my body for his wealth Which but for him that had your husbands ring Had quite miscarried I dare be bound again My soul upon the forfeit that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly PORTIA Then you shall be his surety Give him this And bid him keep it better than the other ANTONIO Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring BASSANIO By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor PORTIA I had it of him pardon me Bassanio For by this ring the doctor lay with me NERISSA And pardon me my gentle Gratiano For that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerk In lieu of this last night did lie with me GRATIANO Why this is like the mending of highways In summer where the ways are fair enough What are we cuckolds ere we have deservd it PORTIA Speak not so grossly You are all amazd Here is a letter read it at your leisure It comes from Padua from Bellario There you shall find that Portia was the doctor Nerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you And even but now returnd I have not yet Enterd my house Antonio you are welcome And I have better news in store for you Than you expect unseal this letter soon There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter ANTONIO I am dumb BASSANIO Were you the doctor and I knew you not GRATIANO Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold NERISSA Ay but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man BASSANIO Sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow When I am absent then lie with my wife ANTONIO Sweet lady you have given me life and living For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road PORTIA How now Lorenzo My clerk hath some good comforts too for you NERISSA Ay and Ill give them him without a fee There do I give to you and Jessica From the rich Jew a special deed of giftAfter his death of all he dies possessd of LORENZO Fair ladies you drop manna in the way Of starved people PORTIA It is almost morning And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full Let us go in And charge us there upon intergatories And we will answer all things faithfully GRATIANO Let it be so The first intergatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay Or go to bed now being two hours to day But were the day come I should wish it dark Till I were couching with the doctors clerk Well while I live Ill fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissas ring Exeunt THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR Contents ACT I Scene I Windsor Before Pages house

this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies weight Why this hath not a fingers dignity They call this bedwork mappry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution NESTOR Let this be granted and Achilles horse Makes many Thetis sons Tucket AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus MENELAUS From Troy Enter Aeneas AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent AENEAS Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you AGAMEMNON Even this AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles arm Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals AGAMEMNON How AENEAS Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers AENEAS Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd As bending angels thats their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Joves accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praisd himself

trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speak AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnons sleeping hour That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake He tells thee so himself AENEAS Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fairst of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That feeds his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none hell say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so much AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hectors grandsire suckd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put this witherd brawns And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood Ill prove this troth with my three drops of blood AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ULYSSES Amen AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you sir Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor ULYSSES Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape NESTOR What ist ULYSSES This tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be croppd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all NESTOR Well and how ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgement Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose Pointing on him ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you NESTOR Why tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute With their finst palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly poisd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large It is supposd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As twere from forth us all a man distilld Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertaind limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance theyll sell If not the lustre of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are doggd with two strange followers NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should share with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foild Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lottry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off Well dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our projects life this shape of sense assumes Ajax employd plucks down Achilles plumes NESTOR Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre

surety Surety secure but modest doubt is calld The beacon of the wise the tent that searches To th bottom of the worst Let Helen go Since the first sword was drawn about this question Every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes Hath been as dear as HelenI mean of ours If we have lost so many tenths of ours To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us Had it our name the value of one ten What merits in that reason which denies The yielding of her up TROILUS Fie fie my brother Weigh you the worth and honour of a king So great as our dread fathers in a scale Of common ounces Will you with counters sum The pastproportion of his infinite And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons Fie for godly shame HELENUS No marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons You are so empty of them Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason Because your speech hath none that tells him so TROILUS You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons You know an enemy intends you harm You know a sword employd is perilous And reason flies the object of all harm Who marvels then when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove Or like a star disorbd Nay if we talk of reason Lets shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honour Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts With this crammd reason Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject HECTOR Brother she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping TROILUS Whats aught but as tis valued HECTOR But value dwells not in particular will It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein tis precious of itself As in the prizer Tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the god And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects Without some image of thaffected merit TROILUS I take today a wife and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears Two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgement how may I avoid Although my will distaste what it elected The wife I chose There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soild them nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve Because we now are full It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks Your breath with full consent bellied his sails The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce And did him service He touchd the ports desird And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollos and makes stale the morning Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl Whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships And turnd crownd kings to merchants If youll avouch twas wisdom Paris went As you must needs for you all cried Go go If youll confess he brought home worthy prize As you must needs for you all clappd your hands And cried Inestimablewhy do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate And do a deed that never Fortune did Beggar the estimation which you prizd Richer than sea and land O theft most base That we have stoln what we do fear to keep But thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans cry PRIAM What noise what shriek is this TROILUS Tis our mad sister I do know her voice CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans HECTOR It is Cassandra Enter Cassandra raving CASSANDRA Cry Trojans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes And I will fill them with prophetic tears HECTOR Peace sister peace CASSANDRA Virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to comeCry Trojans cry Practise your eyes with tears Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all Cry Trojans cry A Helen and a woe Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go Exit HECTOR Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse Or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause Can qualify the same TROILUS Why brother Hector We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandras mad Her brainsick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engagd To make it gracious For my private part I am no more touchd than all Priams sons And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain PARIS Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels But I attest the gods your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project For what alas can these my single arms What propugnation is in one mans valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite Yet I protest Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will Paris should neer retract what he hath done Nor faint in the pursuit PRIAM Paris you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights You have the honey still but these the gall So to be valiant is no praise at all PARIS Sir I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wipd off in honourable keeping her What treason were it to the ransackd queen Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms Theres not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamd Where Helen is the subject Then I say Well may we fight for her whom we know well The worlds large spaces cannot parallel HECTOR Paris and Troilus you have both said well And on the cause and question now in hand Have glozd but superficially not much Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distempred blood Than to make up a free determination Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision Nature craves All dues be rendred to their owners Now What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection And that great minds of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills resist the same There is a law in each wellorderd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory If Helen then be wife to Spartas king As it is known she isthese moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back returnd Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong But makes it much more heavy Hectors opinion Is this in way of truth Yet neertheless My spritely brethren I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still For tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignities TROILUS Why there you touchd the life of our design Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector She is a theme of honour and renown A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds Whose present courage may beat down our foes And fame in time to come canonize us For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promisd glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide worlds revenue HECTOR I am yours You valiant offspring of great Priamus I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits I was advertisd their great general slept Whilst emulation in the army crept This I presume will wake him Exeunt SCENE III The Grecian camp Before the tent of Achilles Enter Thersites solus THERSITES How now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he raild at me Sfoot Ill learn to conjure and raise devils but Ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then theres Achilles a rare engineer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunderdarter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which shortarmd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan boneache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say Amen What ho my Lord Achilles Enter Patroclus PATROCLUS Whos there Thersites Good Thersites

Ajax and Calchas ACHILLES Come Patroclus Ill speak with nobody Come in with me Thersites Exit THERSITES Here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery All the argument is a whore and a cuckolda good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon Now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all Exit AGAMEMNON Where is Achilles PATROCLUS Within his tent but illdisposd my lord AGAMEMNON Let it be known to him that we are here He shent our messengers and we lay by Our appertainings visiting of him Let him be told so lest perchance he think We dare not move the question of our place Or know not what we are PATROCLUS I shall say so to him Exit ULYSSES We saw him at the opening of his tent He is not sick AJAX Yes lionsick sick of proud heart You may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head tis pride But why why Let him show us a cause A word my lord Takes Agamemnon aside NESTOR What moves Ajax thus to bay at him ULYSSES Achilles

Patroclus Here comes Patroclus NESTOR No Achilles with him ULYSSES The elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure PATROCLUS Achilles bids me say he is much sorry If any thing more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state To call upon him he hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake An afterdinners breath AGAMEMNON Hear you Patroclus We are too well acquainted with these answers But his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn Cannot outfly our apprehensions Much attribute he hath and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues Not virtuously on his own part beheld Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him We come to speak with him and you shall not sin If you do say we think him overproud And underhonest in selfassumption greater Than in the note of judgement and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on Disguise the holy strength of their command And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance yea watch His course and time his ebbs and flows as if The passage and whole stream of this commencement Rode on his tide Go tell him this and add That if he overhold his price so much Well none of him but let him like an engine Not portable lie under this report Bring action hither this cannot go to war A stirring dwarf we do allowance give Before a sleeping giant Tell him so PATROCLUS I shall and bring his answer presentlyExit AGAMEMNON

as I do hate the engendring of toads NESTOR Aside And yet he loves himself ist not strange ULYSSES Achilles will not to the field tomorrow AGAMEMNON Whats his excuse ULYSSES He doth rely on none But carries on the stream of his dispose Without observance or respect of any In will peculiar and in selfadmission AGAMEMNON Why will he not upon our fair request Untent his person and share thair with us ULYSSES Things small as nothing for requests sake only He makes important possessd he is with greatness And speaks not to himself but with a pride That quarrels at selfbreath Imagind worth Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse That twixt his mental and his active parts Kingdomd Achilles in commotion rages And batters down himself What should I say He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it Cry No recovery AGAMEMNON Let Ajax go to him Dear lord go you and greet him in his tent Tis said he holds you well and will be led At your request a little from himself ULYSSES O Agamemnon let it not be so Well consecrate the steps that Ajax makes When they go from Achilles Shall the proud lord That bastes his arrogance with his own seam And never suffers matter of the world Enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve And ruminate himselfshall he be worshippd Of that we hold an idol more than he No this thrice worthy and right valiant lord Shall not so stale his palm

alms to hang him Shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous CLAUDIO And she is exceeding wise DON PEDRO In everything but in loving Benedick LEONATO O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian DON PEDRO I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say LEONATO Were it good think you CLAUDIO Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness DON PEDRO She doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the manas you know allhath a contemptible spirit CLAUDIO He is a very proper man DON PEDRO He hath indeed a good outward happiness CLAUDIO Fore God and in my mind very wise DON PEDRO He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit CLAUDIO And I take him to be valiant DON PEDRO As Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear LEONATO If he do fear God a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling DON PEDRO And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love CLAUDIO Never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel LEONATO Nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first DON PEDRO Well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady LEONATO My lord will you walk dinner is ready CLAUDIO Aside If he do not dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation DON PEDRO Aside Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumb show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Exeunt Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato BENEDICK Advancing from the arbour This can be no trick the conference was sadly borne They have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair tis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous tis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day shes a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her Enter Beatrice BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner BENEDICK Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful I would not have come BENEDICK You take pleasure then in the message BEATRICE Yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior fare you well Exit BENEDICK Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture Exit ACT III SCENE I Leonatos Garden Enter Hero Margaret and Ursula HERO Good Margaret run thee to the parlour There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursala Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her say that thou overheardst us And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripend by the sun Forbid the sun to enter like favourites Made proud by princes that advance their pride Against that power that bred it There will she hide her To listen our propose This is thy office Bear thee well in it and leave us aloneMARGARET Ill make her come I warrant you presently Exit HERO Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come As we do trace this alley up and down Our talk must only be of Benedick When I do name him let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice of this matter Is little Cupids crafty arrow made That only wounds by hearsay Enter Beatrice behind Now begin For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground to hear our conference URSULA The pleasantst angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait So angle we for Beatrice who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture Fear you not my part of the dialogue HERO Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it They advance to the bower No truly Ursula she is too disdainful I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock URSULA But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely HERO So says the Prince and my newtrothed lord URSULA And did they bid you tell her of it madam HERO They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them if they lovd Benedick To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it URSULA Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon HERO O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man But Nature never framd a womans heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes Misprising what they look on and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so selfendeard URSULA Sure I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love lest she make sport at it HERO Why you speak truth I never yet saw man How wise how noble young how rarely featurd But she would spell him backward if fairfacd She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black why Nature drawing of an antick Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded If low an agate very vilely cut If speaking why a vane blown with all winds If silent why a block moved with none So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth URSULA Sure sure such carping is not commendable HERO No not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is cannot be commendable But who dare tell her so If I should speak She would mock me into air O she would laugh me Out of myself press me to death with wit Therefore let Benedick like coverd fire Consume away in sighs waste inwardly It were a better death than die with mocks Which is as bad as die with tickling URSULA Yet tell her of it hear what she will say HERO No rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And truly Ill devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking URSULA O do not do your cousin such a wrong She cannot be so much without true judgment Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prizd to haveas to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick HERO He is the only man of Italy Always excepted my dear Claudio URSULA I pray you be not angry with me madam Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick For shape for bearing argument and valour Goes foremost in report through Italy HERO Indeed he hath an excellent good name URSULA His excellence did earn it ere he had it When are you married madam HERO Why every day tomorrow Come go in Ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow URSULA Shes limd I warrant you We have caught her madam HERO If it prove so then loving goes by haps Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps Exeunt Hero and Ursula BEATRICE Advancing What fire is in mine ears Can this be true Stand I condemnd for pride and scorn so much Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu No glory lives behind the back of such And Benedick love on I will requite thee Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band For others say thou dost deserve and I Believe it better than reportingly Exit SCENE II A Room in Leonatos House Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick and Leonato DON PEDRO I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Arragon CLAUDIO Ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me DON PEDRO Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks BENEDICK Gallants I am not as I have been LEONATO So say I methinks you are sadder CLAUDIO I hope he be in love DON PEDRO Hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love If he be sad he wants money BENEDICK I have the toothache DON PEDRO Draw it BENEDICK Hang it CLAUDIO You must hang it first and draw it afterwards DON PEDRO What sigh for the toothache LEONATO Where is but a humour or a worm BENEDICK Well everyone can master a grief but he that has it CLAUDIO Yet say I he is in love DON PEDRO There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman today a Frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is CLAUDIO If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode DON PEDRO Hath any man seen him at the barbers CLAUDIO No but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls LEONATO Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard DON PEDRO Nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that CLAUDIO Thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love DON PEDRO The greatest note of it is his melancholy CLAUDIO And when was he wont to wash his face DON PEDRO Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say of him CLAUDIO Nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now governed by stops DON PEDRO Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude he is in love CLAUDIO Nay but I know who loves him DON PEDRO That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not CLAUDIO Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him DON PEDRO She shall be buried with her face upwards BENEDICK Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old signior walk aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobbyhorses must not hear Exeunt Benedick and Leonato DON PEDRO For my life to break with him about Beatrice CLAUDIO Tis even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet Enter Don John DON JOHN My lord and brother God save you DON PEDRO Good den brother DON JOHN If your leisure served I would speak with you DON PEDRO In private DON JOHN If it please you yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns him DON PEDRO Whats the matter DON JOHN To Claudio Means your lordship to be married tomorrow DON PEDRO You know he does DON JOHN I know not that when he knows what I know CLAUDIO If there be any impediment I pray you discover it DON JOHN You may think I love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother I think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit illspent and labour ill bestowed DON PEDRO Why whats the matter DON JOHN I came hither to tell you and circumstances shortenedfor she has been too long a talking ofthe lady is disloyal CLAUDIO

A Street Enter Dogberry and Verges with the Watch DOGBERRY Are you good men and true VERGES Yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul DOGBERRY Nay that were a punishment

man to be constable FIRST WATCH Hugh Oatcake sir or George Seacoal for they can write and read DOGBERRY Come hither neighbour Seacoal God hath blessed you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of Fortune but to write and read comes by Nature SECOND WATCH Both which Master Constable DOGBERRY You have I knew it would be your answer Well for your favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn This is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the Princes nameSECOND WATCH How if a will not stand DOGBERRY Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave VERGES If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the Princes subjects DOGBERRY True and they are to meddle with none but the Princes subjects You shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured SECOND WATCH We will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch DOGBERRY Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen Well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed SECOND WATCH How if they will not DOGBERRY Why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for SECOND WATCH Well sir DOGBERRY If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty SECOND WATCH If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him DOGBERRY Truly by your office you may but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled The most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company VERGES You have been always called a merciful man partner DOGBERRY Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him VERGES If you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it SECOND WATCH How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us DOGBERRY Why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not

Prince in the night you may stay him VERGES Nay byr lady that I think a cannot DOGBERRY Five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the Prince be

years a goes up and down like a gentleman I remember his name BORACHIO Didst thou not hear somebody CONRADE No twas the vane on the house BORACHIO Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty sometime fashioning them like Pharaohs soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god Bels priests in the old church window sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club CONRADE All this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion BORACHIO Not so neither but know that I have tonight wooed Margaret the Lady Heros gentlewoman by the name of Hero she leans me out at her mistress chamber window bids me a thousand times good nightI tell this tale vilelyI should first tell thee how the Prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter CONRADE And thought they Margaret was Hero BORACHIO Two of them did the Prince and Claudio but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villainy which did confirm any slander that Don John had made away went Claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw oer night and send her home again without a husband FIRST WATCH We charge you in the Princes name stand SECOND WATCH Call up the right Master Constable We have here recovered the most

take her back again Give not this rotten orange to your friend Shes but the sign and semblance of her honour Behold how like a maid she blushes here O what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue Would you not swear All you that see her that she were a maid By these exterior shows But she is none She knows the heat of a luxurious bed Her blush is guiltiness not modesty LEONATO What do you mean my lord CLAUDIO Not to be married Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton LEONATO Dear my lord if you in your own proof Have vanquishd the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity CLAUDIO I know what you would say if I have known her You will say she did embrace me as a husband And so extenuate

thou wouldst not quickly die Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames Myself would on the rearward of reproaches Strike at thy life Grievd I I had but one Chid I for that at frugal Natures frame O one too much by thee Why had I one Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggars issue at my gates Who smirched thus and mird with infamy I might have said No part of it is mine This shame derives itself from unknown loins But mine and mine I lovd and mine I praisd And mine that I was proud on mine so much That I myself was to myself not mine Valuing of her why sheO she is fallen Into a pit of ink that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again And salt too little which may season give To her foul tainted flesh BENEDICK Sir sir be patient For my part I am so attird in wonder I know not what to say BEATRICE O on my soul my cousin is belied BENEDICK Lady were you her bedfellow last night BEATRICE No truly not although

lovd her so that speaking of her foulness Washd it with tears Hence from her let her die FRIAR Hear me a little For I have only been silent so long And given way unto this course of fortune By noting of the lady I have markd A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness bear away those blushes And in her eye there hath appeard a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth Call me a fool Trust not my reading nor my observations Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenure of my book trust not my age My reverence calling nor divinity If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error LEONATO Friar it cannot be Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury she not denies it Why seekst thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness FRIAR Lady what man is he you are accusd of HERO They know that"

baby Here she is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to meWhat are you gone again You must be watchd ere you be made tame must you Come your ways come your ways and you draw backward well put you i th fills Why do you not speak to her Come draw this curtain and lets see your picture Alas the day how loath you are to offend daylight And twere dark youd close sooner So so rub on and kiss the mistress How now a kiss in feefarm Build there carpenter the air is sweet Nay you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you The falcon as the tercel for all the ducks i th river Go to go to TROILUS You have bereft me of all words lady PANDARUS Words pay no debts give her deeds but shell bereave you o th deeds too if she call your activity in question What billing again Heres In witness whereof the parties interchangeably Come in come in Ill go get a fire Exit CRESSIDA Will you walk in my lord TROILUS O Cressid how often have I wishd me thus CRESSIDA Wishd my lord The gods grantO my lord TROILUS What should they grant What makes this pretty abruption What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love CRESSIDA More dregs than water if my fears have eyes TROILUS Fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly CRESSIDA Blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear To fear the worst oft cures the worse TROILUS O let my lady apprehend no fear In all Cupids pageant there is presented no monster CRESSIDA Nor nothing monstrous neither TROILUS Nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed This is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confind that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit CRESSIDA They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters TROILUS Are there such Such are not we Praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present We will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble Few words to fair faith Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus CRESSIDA Will you walk in my lord Reenter Pandarus PANDARUS What blushing still Have you not done talking yet CRESSIDA Well uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to you PANDARUS I thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you youll give him me Be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for it TROILUS You know now your hostages your uncles word and my firm faith PANDARUS Nay Ill give my word for her too our kindred though they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won they are burs I can tell you theyll stick where they are thrown CRESSIDA Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart Prince Troilus I have lovd you night and day For many weary months TROILUS Why was my Cressid then so hard to win CRESSIDA Hard to seem won but I was won my lord With the first glance that everpardon me If I confess much you will play the tyrant I love you now but till now not so much But I might master it In faith I lie My thoughts were like unbridled children grown Too headstrong for their mother See we fools Why have I blabbd Who shall be true to us When we are so unsecret to ourselves But though I lovd you well I wood you not And yet good faith I wishd myself a man Or that we women had mens privilege Of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue For in this rapture I shall surely speak The thing I shall repent See see your silence Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws My very soul of counsel Stop my mouth TROILUS And shall albeit sweet music issues thence PANDARUS Pretty i faith CRESSIDA My lord I do beseech you pardon me Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss I am ashamd O heavens what have I done For this time will I take my leave my lord TROILUS Your leave sweet Cressid PANDARUS Leave And you take leave till tomorrow morning CRESSIDA Pray you content you TROILUS What offends you lady CRESSIDA Sir mine own company TROILUS You cannot shun yourself CRESSIDA Let me go and try I have a kind of self resides with you But an unkind self that itself will leave To be anothers fool I would be gone Where is my wit I know not what I speak TROILUS Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely CRESSIDA Perchance my lord I show more craft than love And fell so roundly to a large confession To angle for your thoughts but you are wise Or else you love not for to be wise and love Exceeds mans might that dwells with gods above TROILUS O that I thought it could be in a woman As if it can I will presume in you To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love To keep her constancy in plight and youth Outliving beautys outward with a mind That doth renew swifter than blood decays Or that persuasion could but thus convince me That my integrity and truth to you Might be affronted with the match and weight Of such a winnowed purity in love How were I then uplifted But alas I am as true as truths simplicity And simpler than the infancy of truth CRESSIDA In that Ill war with you TROILUS O virtuous fight When right with right wars who shall be most right True swains in love shall in the world to come Approve their truth by Troilus when their rhymes Full of protest of oath and big compare Want similes truth tird with iteration As true as steel as plantage to the moon As sun to day as turtle to her mate As iron to adamant as earth to th centre Yet after all comparisons of truth As truths authentic author to be cited As true as Troilus shall crown up the verse And sanctify the numbers CRESSIDA Prophet may you be If I be false or swerve a hair from truth When time is old and hath forgot itself When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy And blind oblivion swallowd cities up And mighty states characterless are grated To dusty nothingyet let memory From false to false among false maids in love Upbraid my falsehood when th have said As false As air as water wind or sandy earth As fox to lamb or wolf to heifers calf Pard to the hind or stepdame to her son Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood As false as Cressid PANDARUS Go to a bargain made seal it seal it Ill be the witness Here I hold your hand here my cousins If ever you prove false one to another since I have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goersbetween be calld to the worlds end after my namecall them all Pandars let all constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids and all brokers between Pandars Say Amen TROILUS Amen CRESSIDA Amen PANDARUS Amen Whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters press it to death Away Exeunt Troilus and Cressida And Cupid grant all tonguetied maidens here Bed chamber pander to provide this gear Exit SCENE III The Greek camp Flourish Enter Agamemnon Ulysses Diomedes Nestor Ajax Menelaus and Calchas CALCHAS Now Princes for the service I have done Thadvantage of the time prompts me aloud To call for recompense Appear it to your mind That through the sight I bear in things to come I have abandond Troy left my possession Incurrd a traitors name exposd myself From certain and possessd conveniences To doubtful fortunes sequestring from me all That time acquaintance custom and condition Made tame and most familiar to my nature And here to do you service am becomeAs new into the world strange unacquainted I do beseech you as in way of taste To give me now a little benefit Out of those many registred in promise Which you say live to come in my behalf AGAMEMNON What wouldst thou of us Trojan Make demand CALCHAS You have a Trojan prisoner calld Antenor Yesterday took Troy holds him very dear Oft have youoften have you thanks therefore Desird my Cressid in right great exchange Whom Troy hath still denied but this Antenor I know is such a wrest in their affairs That their negotiations all must slack Wanting his manage and they will almost Give us a prince of blood a son of Priam In change of him Let him be sent great Princes And he shall buy my daughter and her presence Shall quite strike off all service I have done In most accepted pain AGAMEMNON Let Diomedes bear him And bring us Cressid hither Calchas shall have What he requests of us Good Diomed Furnish you fairly for this interchange Withal bring word if Hector will tomorrow Be answerd in his challenge Ajax is ready DIOMEDES This shall I undertake and tis a burden Which I am proud to bear Exeunt Diomedes and Calchas Achilles and Patroclus stand in their tent ULYSSES Achilles stands i thentrance of his tent Please it our general pass strangely by him As if he were forgot and Princes all Lay negligent and loose regard upon him I will come last Tis like hell question me Why such unplausive eyes are bent why turnd on him If so I have derision medcinable To use between your strangeness and his pride Which his own will shall have desire to drink It may do good Pride hath no other glass To show itself but pride for supple knees Feed arrogance and are the proud mans fees AGAMEMNON Well execute your purpose and put on A form of strangeness as we pass along So do each lord and either greet him not Or else disdainfully which shall shake him more Than if not lookd on I will lead the way ACHILLES What comes the general to speak with me You know my mind Ill fight no more gainst Troy AGAMEMNON What says Achilles Would he aught with us NESTOR Would you my lord aught with the general ACHILLES No NESTOR Nothing my lord AGAMEMNON The better Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor ACHILLES Good day good day MENELAUS How do you How do you Exit ACHILLES What does the cuckold scorn me AJAX How now Patroclus ACHILLES Good morrow Ajax AJAX Ha ACHILLES Good morrow AJAX Ay and good next day too Exit ACHILLES What mean these fellows Know they not Achilles PATROCLUS They pass by strangely They were usd to bend To send their smiles before them to Achilles To come as humbly as they usd to creep To holy altars ACHILLES What am I poor of late Tis certain greatness once falln out with fortune Must fall out with men too What the declind is He shall as soon read in the eyes of others As feel in his own fall for men like butterflies Show not their mealy wings but to the summer And not a man for being simply man Hath any honour but honour for those honours That are without him as place riches and favour Prizes of accident as oft as merit Which when they fall as being slippery standers The love that leand on them as slippery too Doth one pluck down another and together Die in the fall But tis not so with me Fortune and I are friends I do enjoy At ample point all that I did possess Save these mens looks who do methinks find out Something not worth in me such rich beholding As they have often given Here is Ulysses Ill interrupt his reading How now Ulysses ULYSSES Now great Thetis son ACHILLES What are you reading ULYSSES A strange fellow here Writes me that manhow dearly ever parted How much in having or without or in Cannot make boast to have that which he hath Nor feels not what he owes but by reflection As when his virtues shining upon others Heat them and they retort that heat again To the first giver ACHILLES This is not strange Ulysses The beauty that is borne here in the face The bearer knows not but commends itself To others eyes nor doth the eye itself That most pure spirit of sensebehold itself Not going from itself but eye to eye opposed Salutes each other with each others form For speculation turns not to itself Till it hath travelld and is mirrord there Where it may see itself This is not strange at all ULYSSES I do not strain at the position It is familiarbut at the authors drift Who in his circumstance expressly proves That no man is the lord of anything Though in and of him there be much consisting Till he communicate his parts to others Nor doth he of himself know them for aught Till he behold them formed in the applause Where thare extended who like an arch reverbrate The voice again or like a gate of steel Fronting the sun receives and renders back His figure and his heat I was much rapt in this And apprehended here immediately Thunknown Ajax Heavens what a man is there A very horse that has he knows not what Nature what things there are Most abject in regard and dear in use What things again most dear in the esteem And poor in worth Now shall we see tomorrow An act that very chance doth throw upon him Ajax renownd O heavens what some men do While some men leave to do How some men creep in skittish Fortunes hall Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes How one man eats into anothers pride While pride is fasting in his wantonness To see these Grecian lordswhy even already They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder As if his foot were on brave Hectors breast And great Troy shrieking ACHILLES I do believe it for they passd by me As misers do by beggars neither gave to me Good word nor look What are my deeds forgot ULYSSES Time hath my lord a wallet at his back Wherein he puts alms for oblivion A greatsizd monster of ingratitudes Those scraps are good deeds past which are devourd As fast as they are made forgot as soon As done Perseverance dear my lord Keeps honour bright To have done is to hang Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail In monumental mockry Take the instant way For honour travels in a strait so narrow Where one but goes abreast Keep then the path For emulation hath a thousand sons That one by one pursue if you give way Or hedge aside from the direct forthright Like to an entred tide they all rush by And leave you hindmost Or like a gallant horse falln in first rank Lie there for pavement to the abject rear Oerrun and trampled on Then what they do in present Though less than yours in past must oertop yours For Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by thhand And with his arms outstretchd as he would fly Grasps in the comer The welcome ever smiles And farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was For beauty wit High birth vigour of bone desert in service Love friendship charity are subjects all To envious and calumniating Time One touch of nature makes the whole world kin That all with one consent praise newborn gauds Though they are made and moulded of things past And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt oerdusted The present eye praises the present object Then marvel not thou great and complete man That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what stirs not The cry went once on thee And still it might and yet it may again If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive And case thy reputation in thy tent Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late Made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves And drave great Mars to faction ACHILLES Of this my privacy I have strong reasons ULYSSES But gainst your privacy The reasons are more potent and heroical Tis known Achilles that you are in love With one of Priams daughters ACHILLES Ha known ULYSSES Is that a wonder The providence thats in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus gold Finds bottom in thuncomprehensive deeps Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles There is a mysterywith whom relation Durst never meddlein the soul of state Which hath an operation more divine Than breath or pen can give expressure to All the commerce that you have had with Troy As perfectly is ours as yours my lord And better would it fit Achilles much To throw down Hector than Polyxena But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home When fame shall in our island sound her trump And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing Great Hectors sister did Achilles win But our great Ajax bravely beat down him Farewell my lord I as your lover speak The fool slides oer the ice that you should break Exit PATROCLUS To this effect Achilles have I movd you A woman impudent and mannish grown Is not more loathd than an effeminate man In time of action I stand condemnd for this They think my little stomach to the war And your great love to me restrains you thus Sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold And like a dewdrop from the lions mane Be shook to air ACHILLES Shall Ajax fight with Hector PATROCLUS Ay and perhaps receive much honour by him ACHILLES I see my reputation is at stake My fame is shrewdly gord PATROCLUS O then beware Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves Omission to do what is necessary Seals a commission to a blank of danger And danger like an ague subtly taints Even then when they sit idly in the sun ACHILLES Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus Ill send the fool to Ajax and desire him Tinvite the Trojan lords after the combat To see us here unarmd I have a womans longing An appetite that I am sick withal To see great Hector in his weeds of peace To talk with him and to behold his visage Even to my full of view Enter Thersites A labour savd THERSITES A wonder ACHILLES What THERSITES Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself ACHILLES How so THERSITES He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing ACHILLES How can that be THERSITES Why a stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say There were wit in this head and twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking The mans undone for ever for if Hector break not his neck i th combat hell breakt himself in vainglory He knows not me I said Good morrow Ajax and he replies Thanks Agamemnon What think you of this man that takes me for the general Hes grown a very land fish languageless a monster A plague of opinion A man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkinACHILLES Thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites THERSITES Who I Why hell answer nobody he professes not answering Speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue ins arms I will put on his presence Let Patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of Ajax ACHILLES To him Patroclus Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmd to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonourd Captain General of the Grecian army Agamemnon Do this PATROCLUS Jove bless great Ajax THERSITES Hum PATROCLUS I come from the worthy Achilles THERSITES Ha PATROCLUS Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent THERSITES Hum PATROCLUS And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon THERSITES Agamemnon PATROCLUS Ay my lord THERSITES Ha PATROCLUS What you say tot THERSITES God buy you with all my heart PATROCLUS Your answer sir THERSITES If tomorrow be a fair day by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other Howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me PATROCLUS Your answer sir THERSITES Fare ye well with all my heart ACHILLES Why but he is not in this tune is he THERSITES No but out of tune thus What music will be in him when Hector has knockd out his brains I know not but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on ACHILLES Come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight THERSITES Let me bear another to his horse for thats the more capable creature ACHILLES My mind is troubled like a fountain stirrd And I myself see not the bottom of it Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus THERSITES Would the fountain of your mind were clear again that I might water an ass at it I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance Exit ACT IV SCENE I Troy A street Enter at one side Aeneas and servant with a torch at another Paris Deiphobus Antenor Diomedes the Grecian and others with torches PARIS See ho Who is that

PARIS There is no help The bitter disposition of the time Will have it so On lord well follow you AENEAS Good morrow all Exit with servant PARIS And tell me noble Diomed faith tell me true Even in the soul of sound goodfellowship Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best Myself or Menelaus DIOMEDES Both alike He merits well to have her that doth seek her Not making any scruple of her soilure With such a hell of pain and world of charge And you as well to keep her that defend her Not palating the taste of her dishonour With such a costly loss of wealth and friends He like a puling cuckold would drink up The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece You like a lecher out of whorish loins Are pleasd to breed out your inheritors Both merits poisd each weighs nor less nor more But he as he the heavier for a whore PARIS You are too bitter to your countrywoman DIOMEDES Shes bitter to her country Hear me Paris For every false drop in her bawdy veins A Grecians life hath sunk for every scruple Of her contaminated carrion weight A Trojan hath been slain Since she could speak She hath not given so many good words breath As for her Greeks and Trojans suffred death PARIS Fair Diomed you do as

Cressida PANDARUS Be moderate be moderate CRESSIDA Why tell you me of moderation The grief is fine full perfect that I taste And violenteth in a sense as strong As that which causeth it How can I

precious loss Enter Troilus PANDARUS Here here here he comes Ah sweet ducks CRESSIDA Embracing him O Troilus Troilus PANDARUS What a pair of spectacles is here Let me embrace too O heart as the goodly saying is O heart heavy heart Why sighst thou without breaking where he answers again Because thou canst not ease thy smart By friendship nor by speaking There was never a truer rhyme Let us cast away nothing for we may live to have need of such a verse We see it we see it How now lambs TROILUS Cressid I love thee in so straind a purity That the blessd gods as angry with my fancy More bright in zeal than the devotion which Cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me CRESSIDA Have the gods envy PANDARUS Ay ay ay ay tis too plain a case CRESSIDA And is it true that I must go from Troy TROILUS A hateful truth CRESSIDA What and from Troilus too TROILUS From Troy and Troilus CRESSIDA Ist possible TROILUS And suddenly where injury of chance Puts back leavetaking justles roughly by All time of pause rudely beguiles our lips Of all rejoindure forcibly prevents Our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows Even in the birth of our own labouring breath We two that with so many thousand sighs Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves With the rude brevity and discharge of one Injurious time now with a robbers haste Crams his rich thievry up he knows not how As many farewells as be stars in heaven With distinct breath and consignd kisses to them He fumbles up into a loose adieu And scants us with a single famishd kiss Distasted with the salt of broken tears AENEAS Within My lord is the lady ready TROILUS Hark you are calld Some say the Genius Cries so to him that instantly must die Bid them have patience she shall come anon PANDARUS Where are my tears Rain to lay this

keep it if we can But now it is impossible we should Suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purse SALISBURY Now by the death of Him that died for all These counties were the keys of Normandy But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son WARWICK For grief that they are past recovery For were there hope to conquer them again My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears Anjou and Maine Myself did win them both Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer And are the cities that I got with wounds Delivered up again with peaceful words Mort Dieu YORK For Suffolks duke may he be suffocate That dims the honour of this warlike isle France should have torn and rent my very heart Before I would have yielded to this league I never read but Englands kings have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives And our King Henry gives away his own To match with her

displeased at it Look to it lords Let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect What though the common people favour him Calling him Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice Jesu maintain your royal excellence With God preserve the good Duke Humphrey I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss He will be found a dangerous

Somerset will be Protector Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal Exeunt Buckingham and Somerset SALISBURY Pride went before Ambition follows him While these do labour for their own preferment Behoves it us to labour for the realm I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Did bear him like a noble gentleman Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal More like a soldier than a man o th church As stout and proud as he were lord of all Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal Warwick my son the comfort of my age Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping Hath won the greatest favour of the commons Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey And brother York thy acts in Ireland In bringing them to civil discipline Thy late exploits done in the heart of France When thou

to courtesans Still revelling like lords till all be gone Whileas the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands And shakes his head and trembling stands aloofWhile all is shared and all is borne away Ready to starve and dare not touch his own So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue While his own lands are bargained for and sold Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt Unto the princes heart of Calydon Anjou and Maine both given unto the French Cold news for me for I had hope of France Even as I have of fertile Englands soil A day will come when York shall claim his own And therefore I will take the Nevilles parts And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey And when I spy advantage claim the crown For thats the golden mark I seek to hit Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist Nor wear the diadem upon his head Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown Then York be still awhile till time do serve Watch thou and wake when others be asleep To pry into the secrets of the state Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and Englands dearbought Queen And Humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed And in

London A Room in the palace Enter King Richard John of Gaunt with other Nobles and Attendants KING RICHARD Old John of Gaunt timehonoured Lancaster Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boistrous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray GAUNT I have my liege KING RICHARD Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in him GAUNT As near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aimed at your Highness no inveterate malice KING RICHARD Then call them to our presence Face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak Highstomached are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire Enter Bolingbroke and Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign my most loving liege MOWBRAY Each day still better others happiness Until the heavens envying earths good hap Add an immortal title to your crown KING RICHARD We thank you both Yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Firstheaven be the record to my speech In the devotion of a subjects love Tendring the precious safety of my prince And free from other misbegotten hate Come I appellant to this princely presence Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to be so and too bad to live Since the more fair and crystal is the sky The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly Once more the more to aggravate the note With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat And wish so please my sovereign ere I move What my tongue speaks my rightdrawn sword may prove MOWBRAY Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal Tis not the trial of a womans war The bitter clamour of two eager tongues Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cooled for this Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hushed and naught at all to say First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had returned These terms of treason doubled down his throat Setting aside his high bloods royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Wherever Englishman durst set his foot Meantime let this defend my loyalty By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie BOLINGBROKE Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the King And lay aside my high bloods royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise MOWBRAY I take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder Ill answer thee in any fair degree Or chivalrous design of knightly trial And when I mount alive may I not light If I be traitor or unjustly fight KING RICHARD What doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays charge It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him BOLINGBROKE Look what I speak my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your highness soldiers The which he hath detained for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain Besides I say and will in battle prove Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was surveyed by English eye That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spent KING RICHARD How high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this MOWBRAY O let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men hate so foul a liar KING RICHARD Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears Were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir As he is but my fathers brothers son Now by my sceptres awe I make a vow Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul He is our subject Mowbray so art thou Free speech and fearless I to thee allow MOWBRAY Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disbursed I duly to his highness soldiers The other part reserved I by consent For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account Since last I went to France to fetch his queen Now swallow down that lie For Gloucesters death I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case For you my noble Lord of Lancaster The honourable father to my foeOnce did I lay an ambush for your life A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it and exactly begged Your Graces pardon and I hope I had it This is my fault As for the rest appealed It issues from the rancour of a villain A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitors foot To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom In haste whereof most heartily I pray Your highness to assign our trial day KING RICHARD Wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me Lets purge this choler without letting blood This we prescribe though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed Good uncle let this end where it begun Well calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son GAUNT To be a makepeace shall become my age Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolks gage KING RICHARD And Norfolk throw down his GAUNT When Harry when Obedience bids I should not bid again KING RICHARD Norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot MOWBRAY Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot My life thou shalt command but not my shame The one my duty owes but my fair name Despite of death that lives upon my grave To dark dishonours use thou shalt not have I am disgraced impeached and baffled here Pierced to the soul with slanders venomed spear The which no balm can cure but his heartblood Which breathed this poison KING RICHARD Rage must be withstood Give me his gage Lions make leopards tame MOWBRAY Yea but not change his spots Take but my shame And I resign my gage My dear dear lord The purest treasure mortal times afford Is spotless reputation that away Men are but gilded loam or painted clay A jewel in a tentimesbarredup chest Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast Mine honour is my life both grow in one Take honour from me and my life is done Then dear my liege mine honour let me try In that I live and for that will I die KING RICHARD Cousin throw up your gage do you begin BOLINGBROKE O God defend my soul from such deep sin Shall I seem crestfallen in my fathers sight Or with pale beggarfear impeach my height Before this outdared dastard Ere my tongue Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear The slavish motive of recanting fear And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbrays face Exit Gaunt KING RICHARD We were not born to sue but to command Which since we cannot do to make you friends Be ready as your lives shall answer it At Coventry upon Saint Lamberts day There shall your swords and lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your settled hate Since we cannot atone you we shall see Justice design the victors chivalry Lord Marshal command our officersatarms Be ready to direct these home alarms Exeunt SCENE II The same A room in the Duke of Lancasters palace Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester GAUNT Alas the part I had in Woodstocks blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims To stir against the butchers of his life But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven Who when they see the hours ripe on earth Will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads DUCHESS Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur Hath love in thy old blood no living fire Edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one Were as seven vials of his sacred blood Or seven fair branches springing from one root Some of those seven are dried by natures course Some of those branches by the Destinies cut But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester One vial full of Edwards sacred blood One flourishing branch of his most royal root Is cracked and all the precious liquor spilt Is hacked down and his summer leaves all faded By envys hand and murders bloody axe Ah Gaunt his blood was thine That bed that womb That metal that self mould that fashioned thee Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest Yet art thou slain in him Thou dost consent In some large measure to thy fathers death In that thou seest thy wretched brother die Who was the model of thy fathers life Call it not patience Gaunt it is despair In suffring thus thy brother to be slaughtered Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee That which in mean men we entitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts What shall I say To safeguard thine own life The best way is to venge my Gloucesters death GAUNT Gods is the quarrel for Gods substitute His deputy anointed in His sight Hath caused his death the which if wrongfully Let heaven revenge for I may never lift An angry arm against His minister DUCHESS Where then alas may I complain myself GAUNT To God the widows champion and defence DUCHESS Why then I will Farewell old Gaunt Thou goest to Coventry there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight O sit my husbands wrongs on Herefords spear That it may enter butcher Mowbrays breast Or if misfortune miss the first career Be Mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom That they may break his foaming coursers back And throw the rider headlong in the lists A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford Farewell old Gaunt Thy sometimes brothers wife With her companion Grief must end her life GAUNT Sister farewell I must to Coventry As much good stay with thee as go with me DUCHESS Yet one word more Grief boundeth where it falls Not with the empty hollowness but weight I take my leave before I have begun For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done Commend me to thy brother Edmund York Lo this is all Nay yet depart not so Though this be all do not so quickly go I shall remember more Bid himah what With all good speed at Plashy visit me Alack and what shall good old York there see But empty lodgings and unfurnished walls Unpeopled offices untrodden stones And what hear there for welcome but my groans

lay by their helmets and their spears And both return back to their chairs again Withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound While we return these dukes what we decree A long flourish To the Combatants Draw near And list what with our council we have done For that our kingdoms earth should not be soiled With that dear blood which it hath fostered And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect Of civil wounds ploughed up with neighbours swords And for we think the eaglewinged pride Of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts With rivalhating envy set on you To wake our peace which in our countrys cradle Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep Which so roused up with boistrous untuned drums With harshresounding trumpets dreadful bray And grating shock of wrathful iron arms Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace And make us wade even in our kindreds blood Therefore we banish you our territories You cousin Hereford upon pain of life Till twice five summers have enriched our fields Shall not regreet our fair dominions But tread the stranger paths of banishment BOLINGBROKE Your will be done This must my comfort be That sun that warms you here shall shine on me And those his golden beams to you here lent Shall point on me and gild my banishment KING RICHARD Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom Which I with some unwillingness pronounce The sly slow hours shall not determinate The dateless limit of thy dear exile The hopeless word of never to return Breathe I against thee upon pain of life MOWBRAY A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege And all unlooked for from your highness mouth A dearer merit not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air Have I deserved at your highness hands The language I have learnt these forty years My native English now I must forgo And now my tongues use is to me no more Than an unstringed viol or a harp Or like a cunning instrument cased up Or being open put into his hands That knows no touch to tune the harmony Within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue Doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips And dull unfeeling barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me I am too old to fawn upon a nurse Too far in years to be a pupil now What is thy sentence then but speechless death Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath KING RICHARD It boots thee not to be compassionate After our sentence plaining comes too late MOWBRAY Then thus I turn me from my countrys light To dwell in solemn shades of endless night Retiring KING RICHARD Return again and take an oath with thee Lay on our royal sword your banished hands Swear by the duty that you owe to God Our part therein we banish with yourselves To keep the oath that we administer You never shall so help you truth and God Embrace each others love in banishment Nor never look upon each others face Nor never write regreet nor reconcile This louring tempest of your homebred hate Nor never by advised purpose meet To plot contrive or complot any ill Gainst us our state our subjects or our land BOLINGBROKE I swear MOWBRAY And I to keep all this BOLINGBROKE Norfolk so far as to mine enemy By this time had the King permitted us One of our souls had wandered in the air Banished this frail sepulchre of our flesh As now our flesh is banished from this land Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm Since thou hast far to go bear not along The clogging burden of a guilty soul MOWBRAY No Bolingbroke If ever I were traitor My name be blotted from the book of life And I from heaven banished as from hence But what thou art God thou and I do know And all too soon I fear the King shall rue Farewell my liege Now no way can I stray Save back to England all the worlds my way Exit KING RICHARD Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes I see thy grieved heart Thy sad aspect Hath from the number of his banished years Plucked four away To Bolingbroke Six frozen winters spent Return with welcome home from banishment BOLINGBROKE How long a time lies in one little word Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word such is the breath of kings GAUNT I thank my liege that in regard of me He shortens four years of my sons exile But little vantage shall I reap thereby For ere the six years that he hath to spend Can change their moons and bring their times about My oildried lamp and timebewasted light Shall be extinct with age and endless night My inch of taper will be burnt and done And blindfold death not let me see my son KING RICHARD Why uncle thou hast many years to live GAUNT But not a minute king that thou canst give Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow Thou canst help time to furrow me with age But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage Thy word is current with him for my death But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath KING RICHARD Thy son is banished upon good advice Whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave Why at our justice seemst thou then to lour GAUNT Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour You urged me as a judge but I had rather You would have bid me argue like a father O had it been a stranger not my child To smooth his fault I should have been more mild A partial slander sought I to avoid And in the sentence my own life destroyed Alas I looked when some of you should say I was too strict to make mine own away But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue Against my will to do myself this wrong KING RICHARD Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so Six years we banish him and he shall go Flourish Exit King Richard and Train AUMERLE Cousin farewell What presence must not know From where you do remain let paper show MARSHAL My lord no leave take I for I will ride As far as land will let me by your side GAUNT O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends BOLINGBROKE I have too few to take my leave of you When the tongues office should be prodigal To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart GAUNT Thy grief is but thy absence for a time BOLINGBROKE Joy absent grief is present for that time GAUNT What is six winters They are quickly gone BOLINGBROKE To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten GAUNT Call it a travel that thou takst for pleasure BOLINGBROKE My heart will sigh when I miscall it so Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage GAUNT The sullen passage of thy weary steps Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set The precious jewel of thy home return BOLINGBROKE Nay rather every tedious stride I make Will but remember me what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love Must I not serve a long apprenticehood To foreign passages and in the end Having my freedom boast of nothing else But that I was a journeyman to grief GAUNT All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens Teach thy necessity to"

No by no means METELLUS O let us have him for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy mens voices to commend our deeds It shall be said his judgement ruld our hands Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear But all be buried in his gravity BRUTUS O name him not let us not break with him For he will never follow anything That other men begin CASSIUS Then leave him out CASCA Indeed he is not fit DECIUS Shall no man else be touchd but only Caesar CASSIUS Decius well urgd I think it is not meet Mark Antony so well belovd of Caesar Should outlive Caesar we shall find of him A shrewd contriver and you know his means If he improve them may well stretch so far As to annoy us all which to prevent Let Antony and Caesar fall together BRUTUS Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards For Antony is but a limb of Caesar Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood O that we then could come by Caesars spirit And not dismember Caesar But alas Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends Lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully Lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds And let our hearts as subtle masters do Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide em This shall mark Our purpose necessary and not envious Which so appearing to the common eyes We shall be calld purgers not murderers And for Mark Antony think not of him For he can do no more than Caesars arm When Caesars head is off CASSIUS Yet I fear him For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar BRUTUS Alas good Cassius do not think of him If he love Caesar all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar And that were much he should for he is given To sports to wildness and much company TREBONIUS There is no fear in him let him not die For he will live and laugh at this hereafter Clock strikes BRUTUS Peace count the clock CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three TREBONIUS Tis time to part CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no For he is superstitious grown of late Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustomd terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today DECIUS Never fear that if he be so resolved I can oersway him for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayd with trees And bears with glasses elephants with holes Lions with toils and men with flatterers But when I tell him he hates flatterers He says he does being then most flattered Let me work For I can give his humour the true bent And I will bring him to the Capitol CASSIUS Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him BRUTUS By the eighth hour is that the uttermost CINNA Be that the uttermost and fail not then METELLUS Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey I wonder none of you have thought of him BRUTUS Now good Metellus go along by him He loves me well and I have given him reason Send him but hither and Ill fashion him CASSIUS The morning comes upons Well leave you Brutus And friends disperse yourselves but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans BRUTUS Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily Let not our looks put on our purposes But bear it as our Roman actors do With untired spirits and formal constancy And so good morrow to you everyone Exeunt all but Brutus Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men Therefore thou sleepst so sound Enter Portia PORTIA Brutus my lord BRUTUS Portia what mean you Wherefore rise you now It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning PORTIA Nor for yours neither Y have ungently Brutus Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper You suddenly arose and walkd about Musing and sighing with your arms across And when I askd you what the matter was You stard upon me with ungentle looks I urgd you further then you scratchd your head And too impatiently stampd with your foot Yet I insisted yet you answerd not But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you So I did Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seemd too much enkindled and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humour Which sometime hath his hour with every man It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevaild on your condition I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of grief BRUTUS I am not well in health and that is all PORTIA Brutus is wise and were he not in health He would embrace the means to come by it BRUTUS Why so I do Good Portia go to bed PORTIA Is Brutus sick and is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humours Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness No my Brutus You have some sick offence within your mind Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of and upon my knees I charm you by my once commended beauty By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me your self your half Why you are heavy and what men tonight Have had resort to you for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness BRUTUS Kneel not gentle Portia PORTIA I should not need if you were gentle Brutus Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you Am I your self But as it were in sort or limitation To keep with you at meals comfort your bed And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure If it be no more Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife BRUTUS You are my true and honourable wife As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart PORTIA If this were true then should I know this secret I grant I am a woman but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife I grant I am a woman but withal A woman well reputed Catos daughter Think you I am no stronger than my sex Being so fatherd and so husbanded Tell me your counsels I will not disclose em I have made strong proof of my constancyGiving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh can I bear that with patience And not my husbands secrets BRUTUS O ye gods Render me worthy of this noble wife Knock Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart All my engagements I will construe to thee All the charactery of my sad brows Leave me with haste Exit Portia Enter Lucius with Ligarius Lucius whos that knocks LUCIUS Here is a sick man that would speak with you BRUTUS Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how LIGARIUS Vouchsafe goodmorrow from a feeble tongue BRUTUS O what a time have you chose out brave Caius To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick LIGARIUS I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honour BRUTUS Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius Had you a healthful ear to hear of it LIGARIUS By all the gods that Romans bow before I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome Brave son derived from honourable loins Thou like an exorcist hast conjurd up My mortified spirit Now bid me run And I will strive with things impossible Yea get the better of them Whats to do BRUTUS A piece of work that will make sick men whole LIGARIUS But are not some whole that we must make sick BRUTUS That must we also What it is my Caius I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done LIGARIUS Set on your foot And with a heart newfird I follow you To do I know not what but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on Thunder BRUTUS Follow me then Exeunt SCENE II A room in Caesars palace Thunder and lightning Enter Caesar in his nightgown CAESAR Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out Help ho They murder Caesar Whos within Enter a Servant SERVANT My lord CAESAR Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success SERVANT I will my lord Exit Enter Calphurnia CALPHURNIA What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth You shall not stir out of your house today CAESAR Caesar shall forth The things that threatend me Neer lookd but on my back when they shall see The face of Caesar they are vanished CALPHURNIA Caesar I never stood on ceremonies Yet now they fright me There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch A lioness hath whelped in the streets And graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol The noise of battle hurtled in the air Horses did neigh and dying men did groan And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets O Caesar these things are beyond all use And I do fear them CAESAR What can be avoided Whose end is purposd by the mighty gods Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar CALPHURNIA When beggars die there are no comets seen The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes CAESAR Cowards die many times before their deaths The valiant never taste of death but once Of all the wonders that I yet have heard It seems to me most strange that men should fear Seeing that death a necessary end Will come when it will come Enter Servant What say the augurers SERVANT They would not have you to stir forth today Plucking the entrails of an offering forth They could not find a heart within the beast CAESAR The gods do this in shame of cowardice Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear No Caesar shall not Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he We are two lions litterd in one day And I the elder and more terrible And Caesar shall go forth CALPHURNIA Alas my lord Your wisdom is consumd in confidence Do not go forth today call it my fear That keeps you in the house and not your own Well send Mark Antony to the Senatehouse And he shall say you are not well today Let me upon my knee prevail in this CAESAR Mark Antony shall say I am not well And for thy humour I will stay at home Enter Decius Heres Decius Brutus he shall tell them so DECIUS Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar I come to fetch you to the Senatehouse CAESAR And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators And tell them that I will not come today Cannot is false and that I dare not falser I will not come today Tell them so Decius CALPHURNIA Say he is sick CAESAR Shall Caesar send a lie Have I in conquest stretchd mine arm so far To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth Decius go tell them Caesar will not come DECIUS Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause Lest I be laughd at when I tell them so CAESAR The cause is in my will I will not come That is enough to satisfy the Senate But for your private satisfaction Because I love you I will let you know Calphurnia here my wife stays me at home She dreamt tonight she saw my statue Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent and on her knee Hath beggd that I will stay at home today DECIUS This dream is all amiss interpreted It was a vision fair and fortunate Your statue spouting blood in many pipes In which so many smiling Romans bathd Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall press For tinctures stains relics and cognizance This by Calphurnias dream is signified CAESAR And this way have you well expounded it DECIUS I have when you have heard what I can say And know it now The Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar If you shall send them word you will not come Their minds may change Besides it were a mock Apt to be renderd for someone to say Break up the Senate till another time When Caesars wife shall meet with better dreams If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper Lo Caesar is afraid Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this And reason to my love is liable CAESAR How foolish do your fears seem now Calphurnia I am ashamed I did yield to them Give me my robe for I will go Enter Brutus Ligarius Metellus Casca Trebonius Cinna and Publius And look where Publius is come to fetch me PUBLIUS Good morrow Caesar CAESAR Welcome Publius What Brutus are you stirrd so early too Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius Caesar was neer so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you

Be near me that I may remember you TREBONIUS Caesar I will Aside and so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further CAESAR Good friends go in and taste some wine with me And we

lover Artemidorus Here will I stand till Caesar pass along And as a suitor will I give him this My heart laments that virtue cannot live Out of the teeth of emulation If thou read this O Caesar thou

be so good to Caesar as to hear me I shall beseech him to befriend himself PORTIA Why knowst thou any harms intended towards him SOOTHSAYER None that I know will be much that I fear may chance Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow The throng that follows Caesar at the heels Of Senators of Praetors common suitors Will crowd a feeble man almost to death Ill get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along Exit PORTIA I must go in Aside Ay me how weak a thing The heart of woman is O Brutus The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint Run Lucius and commend me to my lord Say I am merry come to me again And bring me word what he doth say to thee Exeunt ACT III SCENE I Rome

prefer his suit to Caesar BRUTUS He is addressd press near and second him CINNA Casca you are the first that rears your hand CAESAR Are we all ready What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress METELLUS Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart Kneeling CAESAR I must prevent thee Cimber These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawd from the true quality With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words Lowcrooked curtsies and base spaniel fawning Thy brother by decree is banished If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him I spurn thee like a cur out of my way Know Caesar dost not wrong nor without cause Will he be satisfied METELLUS Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesars ear For the repealing of

low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber CAESAR I could be well movd if I were as you If I could pray to move prayers would move me But I am constant as the northern star Of whose truefixd and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament The skies are painted with unnumberd sparks They are all fire and every one doth shine But theres but one in all doth hold his place So in the world tis furnishd well with men And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank Unshakd of motion and that I am he Let me a little show it even in this That I was constant Cimber should be banishd And constant do remain to keep him so CINNA O Caesar CAESAR Hence wilt thou lift up Olympus DECIUS Great Caesar CAESAR Doth not Brutus bootless kneel CASCA Speak hands for me Casca stabs Caesar in the neck Caesar catches hold of his arm He is then stabbed by several other Conspirators and at last by Marcus Brutus CAESAR Et tu BruteThen fall Caesar Dies The Senators and People retire in confusion CINNA Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets CASSIUS Some to

most boldest and best hearts of Rome Enter a Servant BRUTUS Soft who comes here A friend of Antonys SERVANT Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down And being prostrate thus he bade me say Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving Say I love Brutus and I honour him Say I feard Caesar honourd him and lovd him If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolvd How Caesar hath deservd to lie in death Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith So says my master Antony BRUTUS Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman I never thought him worse Tell him so

Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well I know not gentlemen what you intend Who else must be let blood who else is rank If I myself there is no hour so fit As Caesars deaths hour nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world I do beseech ye if you bear me hard Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years I shall not find myself so apt to die No place will please me so no means of death As here by Caesar and by you cut off The choice and master spirits of this age BRUTUS O Antony beg not your death of us Though now we must appear bloody and cruel As by our hands and this our present act You see we do yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done Our hearts you see not they are pitiful And pity to the general wrong of Rome As fire drives out fire so pity pity Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers temper do receive you in With all kind love good thoughts and reverence CASSIUS Your voice shall be as strong as any mans In the disposing of new dignities BRUTUS Only be patient till we have appeasd The multitude beside themselves with fear And then we will deliver you the cause Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him Have thus proceeded ANTONY I doubt not of your wisdom Let each man render me his bloody hand First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius Gentlemen allalas what shall I say My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me Either a coward or a flatterer That I did love thee Caesar O tis true If then thy spirit look upon us now Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes Most noble in the presence of thy corse Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bayd brave hart Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand Signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe O world thou wast the forest to this hart And this indeed O world the heart of thee How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here

to have with us Will you be prickd in number of our friends Or shall we on and not depend on you ANTONY Therefore I took your hands but was indeed Swayd from the point by looking down on Caesar Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous BRUTUS Or else were this a savage spectacle Our reasons are so full of

know not what may fall I like it not BRUTUS Mark Antony here take you Caesars body You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you dot by our permission Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going After my speech is ended ANTONY Be it so I do desire no more BRUTUS Prepare the body then and follow us Exeunt all but Antony ANTONY O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth That I am meek and gentle with these butchers Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood Over thy wounds now do I prophesy Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue A curse shall light upon the limbs of men Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war All pity chokd with custom of fell deeds And Caesars spirit ranging for revenge With Ate by his side come hot from Hell Shall in these confines with a monarchs voice Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial Enter a Servant You serve Octavius Caesar do you not SERVANT I do Mark Antony ANTONY Caesar did write for him to come to Rome SERVANT He did receive his letters and is coming And bid me say to you by word of mouth Seeing the body O Caesar ANTONY Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep Passion I see is catching for mine eyes Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine Began to water Is thy master coming SERVANT He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome ANTONY Post back with speed and tell him what hath chancd Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome No Rome of safety for Octavius yet Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace there shall I try In my oration how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things Lend me your hand Exeunt with Caesars body SCENE II The same The Forum Enter Brutus and goes into the pulpit and Cassius with a throng of Citizens CITIZENS We will be satisfied let us be satisfied BRUTUS Then follow me and give me audience friends Cassius go you into the other street And part the numbers Those that will hear me speak let em stay here Those that will follow Cassius go with him And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesars death FIRST CITIZEN I will hear Brutus speak SECOND CITIZEN I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them rendered Exit Cassius with some of the Citizens Brutus goes into the rostrum THIRD CITIZEN The noble Brutus is ascended silence BRUTUS Be patient till the last Romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear Believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe Censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesars to him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all free men As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I slew him There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If any speak for him have I offended I pause for a reply CITIZENS None Brutus none BRUTUS Then none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is enrolld in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforcd for which he suffered death Enter Antony and others with Caesars body Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death CITIZENS Live Brutus live live FIRST CITIZEN Bring him with triumph home unto his house SECOND CITIZEN Give him a statue with his ancestors THIRD CITIZEN Let him be Caesar FOURTH CITIZEN Caesars better parts Shall be crownd in Brutus FIRST CITIZEN Well bring him to his house with shouts and clamours BRUTUS My countrymen SECOND CITIZEN Peace Silence Brutus speaks FIRST CITIZEN Peace ho BRUTUS Good countrymen let me depart alone And for my sake stay here with Antony Do grace to Caesars corpse and grace his speech Tending to Caesars glories which Mark Antony By our permission is allowd to make I do entreat you not a man depart Save I alone till Antony have spoke Exit FIRST CITIZEN Stay ho and let us hear Mark Antony THIRD CITIZEN Let him go up into the public chair Well hear him Noble Antony go up ANTONY For Brutus sake I am beholding to you Goes up FOURTH CITIZEN What does he say of Brutus THIRD CITIZEN He says for Brutus sake He finds himself beholding to us all FOURTH CITIZEN Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here FIRST CITIZEN This Caesar was a tyrant THIRD CITIZEN Nay thats certain We are blest that Rome is rid of him SECOND CITIZEN Peace let us hear what Antony can say ANTONY You gentle Romans CITIZENS Peace ho let us hear him ANTONY Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears I come to bury Caesar not to praise him The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interred with their bones So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious If it were so it was a grievous fault And grievously hath Caesar answerd it Here under leave of Brutus and the rest For Brutus is an honourable man So are they all all honourable men Come I to speak in Caesars funeral He was my friend faithful and just to me But Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honourable man He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill Did this in Caesar seem ambitious When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept Ambition should be made of sterner stuff Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honourable man You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And sure he is an honourable man I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke But here I am to speak what I do know You all did love him once not without cause What cause withholds you then to mourn for him O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts And men have lost their reason Bear with me My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar And I must pause till it come back to me FIRST CITIZEN Methinks there is much reason in his sayings SECOND CITIZEN If thou consider rightly of the matter Caesar has had great wrong THIRD CITIZEN Has he masters I fear there will a worse come in his place FOURTH CITIZEN Markd ye his words He would not take the crown Therefore tis certain he was not ambitious FIRST CITIZEN If it be found so some will dear abide it SECOND CITIZEN Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping THIRD CITIZEN Theres not a nobler man in Rome than Antony FOURTH CITIZEN Now mark him he begins again to speak ANTONY But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world now lies he there And none so poor to do him reverence O masters If I were disposd to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong Who you all know are honourable men I will not do them wrong I rather choose To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you Than I will wrong such honourable men But heres a parchment"

have for Olivia you cannot love her You tell her so Must she not then be answerd DUKE There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart no womans heart So big to hold so much they lack retention Alas their love may be called appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia VIOLA Ay but I know DUKE What dost thou know VIOLA Too well what love women to men may owe In faith they

our welldealing countrymen Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives Have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods Excludes all pity from our threatning looks For since the mortal and intestine jars Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay more if any born at Ephesus Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs Again if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to

with the evening sun DUKE Well Syracusian say in brief the cause Why thou departedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camst to Ephesus EGEON A heavier task could not have been imposd Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable Yet that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature not by vile offence Ill utter what my sorrow gives me leave In Syracusa was I born and wed Unto a woman happy but for me And by me had not our hap been bad With her I livd in joy our wealth increasd By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum till my factors death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons And which was strange the one so like the other As could not be distinguishd but by names That very hour and in the selfsame inn A mean woman was delivered Of such a burden male twins both alike Those for their parents were exceeding poor I bought and brought up to attend my sons My wife not meanly proud of two such boys Made daily motions for our home return Unwilling I agreed alas too soon We came aboard A league from Epidamnum had we saild Before the alwayswindobeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm But longer did we not retain much hope For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death Which though myself would gladly have embracd Yet the incessant weepings of my wife Weeping before for what she saw must come And piteous plainings of the pretty babes That mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear Forcd me to seek delays for them and me And this it was for other means was none The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship then sinkingripe to us My wife more careful for the latterborn Had fastned him unto a small spare mast Such as seafaring men provide for storms To him one of the other twins was bound Whilst I had been like heedful of the other The children thus disposd my wife and I Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd Fastned ourselves at either end the mast And floating straight obedient to the stream Was carried towards Corinth as we thought At length the sun gazing upon the earth Dispersd those vapours that offended us And by the benefit of his wished light The seas waxd calm and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this But ere they cameO let me say no more Gather the sequel by that went before DUKE Nay forward old man do not break off so For we may pity though not pardon thee EGEON O had the gods done so I had not now Worthily termd them merciless to us For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues We were encountered by a mighty rock Which being violently borne upon Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst So that in this unjust divorce of us Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in what to sorrow for Her part poor soul seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe Was carried with more speed before the wind And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth as we thought At length another ship had seizd on us And knowing whom it was their hap to save Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrackd guests And would have reft the fishers of their prey Had not their bark been very slow of sail And therefore homeward did they bend their course Thus have you heard me severd from my bliss That by misfortunes was my life prolongd To tell sad stories of my own mishaps DUKE And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for Do me the favour to dilate at full What have befalln of them and thee till now EGEON My youngest boy and yet my eldest care At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother and importund me That his attendant so his case was like Reft of his brother but retaind his name Might bear him company in the quest of him Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see I hazarded the loss of whom I lovd Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia And coasting homeward came to Ephesus Hopeless to find yet loath to leave

thyself and not me too How dearly would it touch thee to the quick Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious And that this body consecrate to thee By ruffian lust should be contaminate Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the staind skin off my harlot brow And from my false hand cut the weddingring And break it with a deepdivorcing vow I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it I am possessd with an adulterate blot My blood is mingled with the crime of lust For if we two be one and thou play false I do digest the poison of thy flesh

after supper of a cheeseparing When he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife He was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible He was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake He came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his goodnights And now is this Vices dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and Ill be sworn he neer saw him but once in the tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshals men I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name for you

Exit ACT IV SCENE I Yorkshire Gaultree Forest Enter the Archbishop of York Mowbray Hastings and others ARCHBISHOP What is this forest calld HASTINGS Tis Gaultree Forest an t shall please your Grace ARCHBISHOP Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth To know the numbers of our enemies HASTINGS We have sent forth already ARCHBISHOP Tis well done My friends and brethren in these great affairs I must acquaint you that I have received Newdated letters from Northumberland Their cold intent tenor and substance thus Here doth he wish his person with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality The which he could not levy whereupon He is retired to ripe his growing fortunes To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful meeting of their opposite MOWBRAY Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to piecesEnter a Messenger HASTINGS Now what news MESSENGER West of this forest scarcely off a mile In goodly form comes on the enemy And by the ground they hide I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand MOWBRAY The just proportion that we gave them out Let us sway on and face them in the field Enter Westmoreland ARCHBISHOP What wellappointed leader fronts us here MOWBRAY I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland WESTMORELAND Health and fair greeting from our general The prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster ARCHBISHOP Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace What doth concern your coming WESTMORELAND Then my lord Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech If that rebellion Came like itself in base and abject routs Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags And countenanced by boys and beggary I say if damnd commotion so appeard In his true native and most proper shape You reverend father and these noble lords Had not been here to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop Whose see is by a civil peace maintaind Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord Whose white investments figure innocence The dove and very blessed spirit of peace Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war Turning your books to graves your ink to blood Your pens to lances and your tongue divine To a loud trumpet and a point of war ARCHBISHOP Wherefore do I this So the question stands Briefly to this end we are all diseased And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever And we must bleed for it of which disease Our late King Richard being infected died But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland I take not on me here as a physician Nor do I as an enemy to peace Troop in the throngs of military men But rather show awhile like fearful war To diet rank minds sick of happiness And purge th obstructions which begin to stop Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly I have in equal balance justly weighd What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer And find our griefs heavier than our offences We see which way the stream of time doth run And are enforced from our most quiet there By the rough torrent of occasion And have the summary of all our griefs When time shall serve to show in articles Which long ere this we offerd to the King And might by no suit gain our audience When we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong The dangers of the days but newly gone Whose memory is written on the earth With yetappearing blood and the examples Of every minutes instance present now Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms Not to break peace or any branch of it But to establish here a peace indeed Concurring both in name and quality WESTMORELAND Whenever yet was your appeal denied Wherein have you been galled by the King What peer hath been subornd to grate on you That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forged rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotions bitter edge ARCHBISHOP My brother general the commonwealth To brother born an household cruelty I make my quarrel in particular WESTMORELAND There is no need of any such redress Or if there were it not belongs to you MOWBRAY Why not to him in part and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honours WESTMORELAND O my good Lord Mowbray Construe the times to their necessities And you shall say indeed it is the time And not the King that doth you injuries Yet for your part it not appears to me Either from the King or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on Were you not restored To all the Duke of Norfolks signories Your noble and right well remembred fathers MOWBRAY What thing in honour had my father lost That need to be revived and breathed in me The King that loved him as the state stood then Was force perforce compelld to banish him And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he Being mounted and both roused in their seats Their neighing coursers daring of the spur Their armed staves in charge their beavers down Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together Then then when there was nothing could have stayd My father from the breast of Bolingbroke O when the King did throw his warder down His own life hung upon the staff he threw Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke WESTMORELAND You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled But if your father had been victor there He neer had borne it out of Coventry For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love Were set on Hereford whom they doted on And blessd and graced indeed more than the King But this is mere digression from my purpose Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace That he will give you audience and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just You shall enjoy them everything set off That might so much as think you enemies MOWBRAY But he hath forcd us to compel this offer And it proceeds from policy not love WESTMORELAND Mowbray you overween to take it so This offer comes from mercy not from fear For lo within a ken our army lies Upon mine honour all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear Our battle is more full of names than yours Our men more perfect in the use of arms Our armour all as strong our cause the best Then reason will our hearts should be as good Say you not then our offer is compelld MOWBRAY Well by my will we shall admit no parley WESTMORELAND That argues but the shame of your offence A rotten case abides no handling HASTINGS Hath the Prince John a full commission In very ample virtue of his father To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon WESTMORELAND That is intended in the generals name I muse you make so slight a question ARCHBISHOP Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule For this contains our general grievances Each several article herein redressd All members of our cause both here and hence That are insinewd to this action Acquitted by a true substantial form And present execution of our wills To us and to our purposes confined We come within our awful banks again And knit our powers to the arm of peace WESTMORELAND This will I show the general Please you lords In sight of both our battles we may meet And either end in peace which God so frame Or to the place of difference call the swords Which must decide it ARCHBISHOP My lord we will do so Exit Westmoreland MOWBRAY There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand HASTINGS Fear you not that if we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains MOWBRAY Yea but our valuation shall be such That every slight and falsederived cause Yea every idle nice and wanton reason Shall to the King taste of this action That were our royal faiths martyrs in love We shall be winnowd with so rough a wind That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff And good from bad find no partition ARCHBISHOP No no my lord Note this the King is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances For he hath found to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life And therefore will he wipe his tables clean And keep no telltale to his memory That may repeat and history his loss To new remembrance For full well he knows He cannot so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion His foes are so enrooted with his friends That plucking to unfix an enemy He doth unfasten so and shake a friend So that this land like an offensive wife That hath enraged him on to offer strokes As he is striking holds his infant up And hangs resolved correction in the arm That was upreard to execution HASTINGS Besides the King hath wasted all his rods On late offenders that he now doth lack The very instruments of chastisement So that his power like to a fangless lion May offer but not hold ARCHBISHOP Tis very true And therefore be assured my good Lord Marshal If we do now make our atonement well Our peace will like a broken limb united Grow stronger for the breaking MOWBRAY Be it so Here is returnd my Lord of Westmoreland Enter Westmoreland WESTMORELAND The prince is here at hand Pleaseth your lordship To meet his Grace just distance tween our armies MOWBRAY Your Grace of York in Gods name then set forward ARCHBISHOP Before and greet his Grace My lord we come Exeunt SCENE II Another part of the forest Enter from one side Mowbray attended afterwards the Archbishop Hastings and others from the other side Prince John of Lancaster and Westmoreland Officers and others with them LANCASTER You are well encounterd here my cousin Mowbray Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop And so to you Lord Hastings and to all My Lord of York it better showd with you When that your flock assembled by the bell Encircled you to hear with reverence Your exposition on the holy text Than now to see you here an iron man Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum Turning the word to sword and life to death That man that sits within a monarchs heart And ripens in the sunshine of his favour Would he abuse the countenance of the king Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken How deep you were within the books of God To us the speaker in his parliament To us th imagined voice of God himself The very opener and intelligencer Between the grace the sanctities of heaven And our dull workings O who shall believe But you misuse the reverence of your place Employ the countenance and grace of heaven As a false favourite doth his princes nameIn deeds dishonourable You have taen up Under the counterfeited zeal of God The subjects of his substitute my father And both against the peace of heaven and him Have here upswarmd them ARCHBISHOP Good my Lord of Lancaster I am not here against your fathers peace But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland The time misorderd doth in common sense Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form To hold our safety up I sent your Grace The parcels and particulars of our grief The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court Whereon this Hydra son of war is born Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmd asleep With grant of our most just and right desires And true obedience of this madness cured Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty MOWBRAY If not we ready are to try our fortunes To the last man HASTINGS And though we here fall down We have supplies to second our attempt If they miscarry theirs shall second them And so success of mischief shall be born And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up Whiles England shall have generation LANCASTER You are too shallow Hastings much too shallow To sound the bottom of the aftertimes WESTMORELAND Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articles LANCASTER I like them all and do allow them well And swear here by the honour of my blood My fathers purposes have been mistook And some about him have too lavishly Wrested his meaning and authority My lord these griefs shall be with speed redressd Upon my soul they shall If this may please you Discharge your powers unto their several counties As we will ours and here between the armies Lets drink together friendly and embrace That all their eyes may bear those tokens home Of our restored love and amity ARCHBISHOP I take your princely word for these redresses LANCASTER I give it you and will maintain my word And thereupon I drink unto your Grace HASTINGS Go captain and deliver to the army This news of peace Let them have pay and part I know it will please them Hie thee captain Exit Officer ARCHBISHOP To you my noble Lord of Westmoreland WESTMORELAND I pledge your Grace and if you knew what pains I have bestowd to breed this present peace You would drink freely but my love to ye Shall show itself more openly hereafter ARCHBISHOP I do not doubt you WESTMORELAND I am glad of it Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray MOWBRAY You wish me health in very happy season For I am on the sudden something ill ARCHBISHOP Against ill chances men are ever merry But heaviness foreruns the good event WESTMORELAND Therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow Serves to say thus Some good thing comes tomorrow ARCHBISHOP Believe me I am passing light in spirit MOWBRAY So much the worse if your own rule be true Shouts within LANCASTER The word of peace is renderd Hark how they shout MOWBRAY This had been cheerful after victory ARCHBISHOP A peace is of the nature of a conquest For then both parties nobly are subdued And neither party loser LANCASTER Go my lord And let our army be discharged too Exit Westmoreland And good my lord so please you let our trains March by us that we may peruse the men We should have coped withal ARCHBISHOP Go good Lord Hastings And ere they be dismissd let them march by Exit Hastings LANCASTER I trust lords we shall lie tonight together Enter Westmoreland Now cousin wherefore stands our army still WESTMORELAND The leaders having charge from you to stand Will not go off until they hear you speak LANCASTER They know their duties Enter Hastings HASTINGS My lord our army is dispersed already Like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses East west north south or like a school broke up Each hurries toward his home and sportingplace WESTMORELAND Good tidings my Lord Hastings for the which I do arrest thee traitor of high treason And you Lord Archbishop and you Lord Mowbray Of capital treason I attach you both MOWBRAY Is this proceeding just and honourable WESTMORELAND Is your assembly so ARCHBISHOP Will you thus break your faith LANCASTER I pawnd thee none I promised you redress of these same grievances Whereof you did complain which by mine honour I will perform with a most Christian care But for you rebels look to taste the due Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours Most shallowly did you these arms commence Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence Strike up our drums pursue the scattrd stray God and not we hath safely fought today Some guard these traitors to the block of death Treasons true bed and yielderup of breath Exeunt SCENE III Another part of the forest Alarum Excursions Enter Falstaff and Colevile meeting FALSTAFF Whats your name sir Of what condition are you

These tardy tricks of yours will on my life One time or other break some gallows back FALSTAFF I would be sorry my lord but it should be thus I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour Do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet Have I in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility I have foundered nine score and odd posts and here traveltainted as I am have in my pure and immaculate valour taken Sir John Colevile of the Dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy But what of that He saw me and yielded that I may justly say with the hooknosed fellow of Rome I came saw and overcame LANCASTER It was more of his courtesy than your deserving FALSTAFF I know not Here he is and here I yield him And I beseech your Grace let it be booked with the rest of this days deeds or by the Lord I will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top ont Colevile kissing my foot to

pins heads to her believe not the word of the noble Therefore let me have right and let desert mount LANCASTER Thines too heavy to mount FALSTAFF Let it shine then LANCASTER Thines too thick to shine

you deserve Exeunt all but Falstaff FALSTAFF I would you had but the wit twere better than your dukedom Good faith this same young soberblooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but thats no marvel he drinks no wine Theres never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male greensickness and then when they marry they get wenches They are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation A good sherrissack hath a twofold operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered oer to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes It illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it awork and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a thousand sons the first humane principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sackEnter Bardolph How now Bardolph BARDOLPH The army is discharged all and gone FALSTAFF Let them go Ill through Gloucestershire and there will I

King Warwick Thomas Duke of Clarence and Humphrey Duke of Gloucester and others KING Now lords if God doth give successful end To this debate that bleedeth at our doors We will our youth lead on to higher fields And draw no swords but what are sanctified Our navy is addressd our power collected Our substitutes in absence well invested And everything lies level to our wish Only we want a little personal strength And pause us till these rebels now afoot Come underneath the yoke of government WARWICK Both which we doubt not but your Majesty Shall soon enjoy KING Humphrey my son of Gloucester Where is the Prince your brother GLOUCESTER I think hes gone to hunt my lord at Windsor KING And how accompanied GLOUCESTER I do not know my lord KING Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him GLOUCESTER No my good lord he is in presence here CLARENCE What would my lord and father KING Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers Cherish it my boy And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation after I am dead Between his greatness and thy other brethren Therefore omit him not blunt not his love Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will For he is gracious if he be observed He hath a tear for pity and a hand Open as day for melting charity Yet notwithstanding being incensed hes flint As humorous as winter and as sudden As flaws congealed in the spring of day His temper therefore must be well observed Chide him for faults and do it reverently When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth But being moody give him time and scope Till that his passions like a whale on ground

sweet As he whose brow with homely biggen bound Snores out the watch of night O majesty When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit Like a rich armour worn in heat of day That scaldst with safety By his gates of breath There lies a downy feather which stirs not Did he suspire that light and weightless down Perforce must move My gracious lord my father This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep That from this golden rigol hath divorced So many English kings Thy due from me Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood Which nature love and filial tenderness Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously

begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way Zounds if I stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approvd in this offence Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety Tis monstrous Iago who begant MONTANO If partially affind or leagud in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier IAGO Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determind sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamour as it so fell out The town might fall in fright he swift of foot Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I neer might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass OTHELLO I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine Enter Desdemona attended Look if my gentle love be not raisd up Ill make thee an example DESDEMONA Whats the matter OTHELLO Alls well now sweeting come away to bed Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon Lead him off Montano is led off Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted Come Desdemona tis the soldiers life To have their balmy slumbers wakd with strife Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio IAGO What are you hurt lieutenant CASSIO Ay past all surgery IAGO Marry Heaven forbid CASSIO Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation IAGO As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you CASSIO I know not IAGO Ist possible CASSIO I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains That we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beastsIAGO Why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself IAGO Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good CASSIO I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblessd and the ingredient is a devil IAGO Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love you CASSIO I have well approved it sirI drunk IAGO You or any man living may be drunk at a time man Ill tell you what you shall do Our generals wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her Importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before CASSIO You advise me well IAGO I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness CASSIO I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here IAGO You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch CASSIO Good night honest Iago Exit IAGO And whats he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit Shes framd as fruitful As the free elements And then for her To win the Moor weret to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetterd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now for whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor Ill pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her bodys lust And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all Enter Roderigo How now Roderigo RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice IAGO How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time Doest not go well Cassio hath beaten thee And thou by that small hurt hast cashierd Cassio Though other things grow fair against the sun Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe Content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee gone Exit Roderigo Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress Ill set her on Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife Ay thats the way Dull not device by coldness and delay Exit ACT III SCENE I Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Cassio and some Musicians CASSIO Masters play here I will content your pains Something thats brief and bid Good morrow general Music Enter Clown CLOWN Why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak i the nose thus FIRST MUSICIAN How sir how CLOWN Are these I pray you wind instruments FIRST MUSICIAN Ay marry are they sir CLOWN O thereby hangs a tail FIRST MUSICIAN Whereby hangs a tale sir CLOWN Marry sir by many a wind instrument that I know But masters heres money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for loves sake to make no more noise with it FIRST MUSICIAN Well sir we will not CLOWN If you have any music that may not be heard tot again But as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care FIRST MUSICIAN We have none such sir CLOWN Then put up your pipes in your bag for Ill away Go vanish into air away Exeunt Musicians CASSIO Dost thou hear mine honest friend CLOWN No I hear not your honest friend I hear you CASSIO Prithee keep up thy quillets Theres a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring tell her theres one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech Wilt thou do this CLOWN She is stirring sir if she will stir hither I shall seem to notify unto her CASSIO Do good my friend Exit Clown Enter Iago In happy time Iago IAGO You have not been abed then CASSIO Why no The day had broke Before we parted I have made bold Iago To send in to your wife My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access IAGO Ill send her to you presently And Ill devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way that your converse and business May be more free CASSIO I humbly thank you fort Exit Iago I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest Enter Emilia EMILIA Good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again CASSIO Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone EMILIA Pray you come in I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely CASSIO I am much bound to you Exeunt SCENE II Cyprus A Room in the Castle Enter Othello Iago and Gentlemen OTHELLO These letters give Iago to the pilot And by him do my duties to the senate That done I will be walking on the works Repair there to me IAGO Well my good lord Ill dot OTHELLO This fortification gentlemen shall we seet GENTLEMEN Well wait upon your lordship Exeunt SCENE III Cyprus The Garden of the Castle Enter Desdemona Cassio and Emilia DESDEMONA Be thou assured good Cassio I will do All my abilities in thy behalf EMILIA Good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his DESDEMONA O thats an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were CASSIO Bounteous madam Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio Hes never anything but your true servant DESDEMONA I knowt I thank you You do love my lord You have known him long and be you well assurd He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distance CASSIO Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstance That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service DESDEMONA Do not doubt that Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee If I do vow a friendship Ill perform it To the last article My lord shall never rest Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift Ill intermingle everything he does With Cassios suit Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away Enter Othello and Iago EMILIA Madam here comes my lord CASSIO Madam Ill take my leave DESDEMONA Why stay and hear me speak CASSIO Madam not now I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes DESDEMONA Well do your discretion Exit Cassio IAGO Ha I like not that OTHELLO What dost thou say IAGO Nothing my lord or ifI know not what OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife IAGO Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike Seeing you coming OTHELLO I do believe twas he DESDEMONA How now my lord I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure OTHELLO Who ist you mean DESDEMONA Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back OTHELLO Went he hence now DESDEMONA Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him back OTHELLO Not now sweet Desdemon some other time DESDEMONA But shallt be shortly OTHELLO The sooner sweet for you DESDEMONA Shallt be tonight at supper OTHELLO No not tonight DESDEMONA Tomorrow dinner then OTHELLO I shall not dine at home I meet the captains at the citadel DESDEMONA Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn I prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith hes penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason Save that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath taen your part to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do much OTHELLO Prithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothingDESDEMONA Why this is not a boon Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this To leave me but a little to myself DESDEMONA Shall I deny you No farewell my lord OTHELLO Farewell my Desdemona Ill come to thee straight DESDEMONA Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you Whateer you be I am obedient Exit with Emilia OTHELLO Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee And when I love thee not Chaos is come again IAGO My noble lord OTHELLO What dost thou say Iago IAGO Did Michael Cassio when you wood my lady Know of your love OTHELLO He did from first to last Why dost thou ask IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought No further harm OTHELLO Why of thy thought Iago IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her OTHELLO O yes and went between us very oft IAGO Indeed OTHELLO Indeed Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that Is he not honest IAGO Honest my lord OTHELLO Honest ay honest IAGO My lord for aught I know OTHELLO What dost thou think IAGO Think my lord OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou likst not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me Show me thy thought IAGO My lord you know I love you OTHELLO I think thou dost And for I know thourt full of love and honesty And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just Theyre close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule IAGO For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest OTHELLO I think so too IAGO Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem IAGO Why then I think Cassios an honest man OTHELLO Nay yet theres more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words IAGO Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As wheres that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear A stranger to thy thoughts IAGO I do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my natures plague To spy into abuses and of my jealousy Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts OTHELLO What dost thou mean IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed OTHELLO By heaven Ill know thy thoughts IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody OTHELLO Ha IAGO O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he oer Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves OTHELLO O misery IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy OTHELLO Why why is this Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolvd exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abusd Look tot I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience Is not to leave undone but keep unknown OTHELLO Dost thou say so IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most OTHELLO And so she did IAGO Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever IAGO I see this hath a little dashd your spirits OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot IAGO Trust me I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see youre movd I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion OTHELLO I will not IAGO Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend My lord I see youre movd OTHELLO No not much movd I do not think but Desdemonas honest IAGO Long live she so And long live you to think so OTHELLO And yet how nature erring from itself IAGO Ay theres the point As to be bold with you Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh One may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent OTHELLO Farewell farewell If more thou dost perceive let me know more Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago IAGO Going My lord I take my leave OTHELLO Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds IAGO Returning My lord I would I might entreat your honour To scan this thing no further Leave it to time Though it be fit that Cassio have his place For sure he fills it up with great ability Yet if you please to hold him off awhile You shall by that perceive him and his means Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity Much will be seen in that In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears As worthy cause I have to fear I am And hold her free I do beseech your honour OTHELLO Fear not my government IAGO I once more take my leave Exit OTHELLO This fellows of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings Id whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune Haply for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have or for I am declind Into the vale of yearsyet thats not much Shes gone I am abusd and my relief Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapour of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others uses Yet tis the plague of great ones Prerogativd are they less than the base Tis destiny unshunnable like death Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken Desdemona comes If she be false O then heaven mocks itself Ill not believet Enter Desdemona and Emilia DESDEMONA How now my dear Othello Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presence OTHELLO I am to blame DESDEMONA Why do you speak so faintly Are you not well OTHELLO I have a pain upon my forehead here DESDEMONA Faith thats with watching twill away again Let me but bind it hard within this hour It will be well OTHELLO Your napkin is too little He puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it Let it alone Come Ill go in with you DESDEMONA I am very sorry that you are not well Exeunt Othello and Desdemona EMILIA I am glad I have found this napkin This was her first remembrance from the Moor My wayward husband hath a hundred times Wood me to steal it But she so loves the token For he conjurd her she should ever keep it That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to Ill have the work taen out And givet Iago What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy Enter Iago IAGO How now What do you here alone EMILIA Do not you chide I have a thing for you IAGO A thing for me It is a common thing EMILIA Ha IAGO To have a foolish wife EMILIA O is that all What will you give me now For that same handkerchief IAGO What handkerchief EMILIA What handkerchief Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me steal IAGO Hast stoln it from her EMILIA No faith she let it drop by negligence And to the advantage I being here took t up Look here it is IAGO A good wench give it me EMILIA What will you do witht that you have been so earnestTo have me filch it IAGO Snatching it Why whats that to you EMILIA If it be not for some purpose of import Give t me again Poor lady shell run mad When she shall lack it IAGO Be not acknown ont I have use for it Go leave me Exit Emilia I will in Cassios lodging lose this napkin And let him find it Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ This may do something The Moor already changes with my poison Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so Enter Othello Look where he comes Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owdst yesterday OTHELLO Ha ha false to me IAGO Why how now general No more of that OTHELLO Avaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack I swear tis better to be much abusd Than but to knowt a little IAGO How now my lord OTHELLO What sense had I of her stoln hours of lust I sawt not thought it not it harmd not me I slept the next night well was free and merry I found not Cassios kisses on her lips He that is robbd not wanting what is stoln Let

enticing lines Able to ravish any dull conceit And which is more she is not so divine So full replete with choice of all delights But with as humble lowliness of mind She is content to be at your command Command I mean of virtuous chaste intents To love and honour Henry as her lord KING HENRY And otherwise will Henry neer presume Therefore my Lord Protector give consent That Margaret may be Englands royal queen GLOUCESTER So should I give consent to flatter sin You know my lord your Highness is betrothd Unto another lady of esteem How shall we then dispense with that contract And not deface your honour with reproach SUFFOLK As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths Or one that at a triumph having vowd To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists By reason of his adversarys odds A poor earls daughter is unequal odds And therefore may be broke without offence GLOUCESTER Why what I pray is Margaret more than that Her father is no better than an earl Although in glorious titles he excel SUFFOLK Yes my lord her father is a king The King of Naples and Jerusalem And of such great authority in France As his alliance will confirm our peace And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance GLOUCESTER And so the Earl of Armagnac may do Because he is near kinsman unto Charles EXETER Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower Where Reignier sooner will receive than give SUFFOLK A dower my lords Disgrace not so your king That he should be so abject base and poor To choose for wealth and not for perfect love Henry is able to enrich his queen And not to seek a queen to make him rich So worthless peasants bargain for their wives As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt in by attorneyship Not whom we will but whom his Grace affects Must be companion of his nuptial bed And therefore lords since he affects her most Most of all these reasons bindeth us In our opinions she should be preferrd For what is wedlock forced but a hell An age of discord and continual strife Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss And is a pattern of celestial peace Whom should we match with Henry being a king But Margaret that is daughter to a king Her peerless feature joined with her birth Approves her fit for none but for a king Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit More than in women commonly is seen Will answer our hope in issue of a king For Henry son unto a conqueror Is likely to beget more conquerors If with a lady of so high resolve As is fair Margaret he be linkd in love Then yield my lords and here conclude with me That Margaret shall be queen and none but she KING HENRY Whether it be through force of your report My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love I cannot tell but this I am assured I feel such sharp dissension in my breast Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear As I am sick with working of my thoughts Take therefore shipping post my lord to France Agree to any covenants and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crownd King Henrys faithful and anointed queen For your expenses and sufficient charge Among the people gather up a tenth Be gone I say for till you do return I rest perplexed with a thousand cares And you good uncle banish all offence If you do censure me by what you were Not what you are I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will And so conduct me where from company I may revolve and ruminate my grief Exit GLOUCESTER Ay grief I fear me both at first and last Exeunt Gloucester and Exeter SUFFOLK Thus Suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes As did the youthful Paris once to Greece With hope to find the like event in love But prosper better than the Troyan

scars in France and Normandy Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself With all the learned council of the realm Studied so long sat in the council house Early and late debating to and fro How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe And had his highness in his infancy Crowned in Paris in despite of foes And shall these labours and these honours die Shall Henrys conquest Bedfords vigilance Your deeds

comfort of my age Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping Hath won the greatest favour of the commons Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey And brother York thy acts in Ireland In bringing them to civil discipline Thy late exploits done in the heart of France When thou wert regent for our sovereign Have made thee feared and honoured of the people Join we together for the public good In what

the articles The peers agreed and Henry was well pleased To change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter I cannot blame them all What ist to them Tis thine they give away and not their own Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage And purchase friends and give to courtesans Still revelling like lords till all be gone Whileas the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands And shakes his head and trembling stands aloofWhile all is shared and all is borne away Ready to starve and dare not touch his own So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue While his own lands are bargained for and sold Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt Unto the princes heart of Calydon Anjou and Maine both given unto the French Cold news for me for I had hope of France Even as I have of fertile Englands soil A day will come when York shall claim his own And therefore I will take the Nevilles parts And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey And when I spy advantage claim the crown For thats the golden mark I seek to hit Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist Nor wear the diadem upon his head Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown Then York be still awhile till time do serve Watch thou and wake when others be asleep To pry into the secrets of the state Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and Englands dearbought Queen And Humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed And in my standard bear the arms of York To grapple with the house of Lancaster And force perforce Ill make him yield the crown Whose bookish rule hath pulled fair England down Exit SCENE II The Duke of Gloucesters House Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his wife Eleanor ELEANOR Why droops my lord like overripened corn Hanging

Henry Be my last breathing in this mortal world My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad ELEANOR What dreamed my lord Tell me and Ill requite it With sweet rehearsal of my mornings dream GLOUCESTER Methought this staff mine officebadge in court Was broke in twain by whom I have forgot But as I think it was by th Cardinal And on the pieces of the broken wand Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset And William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk This was my dream what it doth bode God knows ELEANOR Tut this was nothing but an argument That he that breaks a stick of Gloucesters grove Shall lose his head for his presumption But list to me my Humphrey my sweet Duke Methought I sat in seat of majesty In the cathedral church of Westminster And in that chair where kings and queens are crowned Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneeled to me And on my head did set the diadem GLOUCESTER Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright Presumptuous dame illnurtured Eleanor Art thou not second woman in the realm And the Protectors wife beloved of him Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command Above the reach or compass of thy thought And wilt thou still be hammering treachery

underground That shall make answer to such questions As by your Grace shall be propounded him ELEANOR It is enough Ill think upon the questions When from Saint Albans we do make return Well see these things effected to the full Here Hume take this reward make merry man With thy confederates in this weighty cause Exit HUME Hume must make merry with the Duchess gold Marry and shall But how now Sir John Hume Seal up your lips and give no words but mum The business asketh silent secrecy Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil Yet have I gold flies from another coast I dare not say from the rich cardinal And from the great and newmade Duke of Suffolk Yet I do find it so For to be plain They knowing Dame Eleanors aspiring humour Have hired me to undermine the Duchess And buzz these conjurations in her brain They say A crafty knave does need no broker Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinals broker Hume if you take not heed you shall go near To call

And stolst away the ladies hearts of France I thought King Henry had resembled thee In courage courtship and proportion But all his mind is bent to holiness To number AveMaries on his beads His champions are the prophets and apostles His weapons holy saws of sacred writ His study is his tiltyard and his loves Are brazen images of canonized saints I would the college of the cardinals Would

office hath so far prevaild That face to face and royal eye to eye You have congreeted let it not disgrace me If I demand before this royal view What rub or what impediment there is Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births Should not in this best garden of the world Our fertile France put up her lovely visage Alas she hath from France too long been chasd And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps Corrupting in it own fertility Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart Unpruned dies her hedges evenpleachd Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair Put forth disorderd twigs her fallow leas The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs Losing both beauty and

ALICE Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de Princess KING HENRY The Princess is the better Englishwoman I faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say I love you then if you urge me farther than to say Do you in faith I wear out my suit Give me your answer i faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say you lady KATHARINE Sauf votre honneur me understand well KING HENRY Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into a wife Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off But before God Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urgd nor never break for urging If thou canst love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou livst dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curld pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king And what sayst thou then to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee KATHARINE Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France KING HENRY No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine KATHARINE I cannot tell wat is dat KING HENRY No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried

que vous parlez il est meilleur que langlais lequel je parle KING HENRY No faith ist not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most trulyfalsely must needs be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much English canst thou love me KATHARINE I cannot tell KING HENRY Can any of your neighbours tell Kate Ill ask them Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet youll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because I love thee cruelly If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldierbreeder Shall not thou and I between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard Shall we not What sayst thou my fair flowerdeluce KATHARINE I do not know dat KING HENRY No tis hereafter to know but now to promise Do but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde mon trs cher et divin desse KATHARINE Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France KING HENRY Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in true English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew my fathers ambition He was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear My comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face Thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair Katharine will you have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say Harry of England I am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet is thine who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy English broken therefore queen of all Katharine break thy mind to me in broken English Wilt thou have me KATHARINE Dat is as it shall please le roi mon pre KING HENRY Nay it will please him well Kate it shall please him Kate KATHARINE Den it sall also content me KING HENRY Upon that I kiss your hand and call you

cousin teach you our princess English KING HENRY I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good English BURGUNDY Is she not apt KING HENRY Our tongue is rough coz and

the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet rosd over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to KING HENRY Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces BURGUNDY They are then excusd my lord when they see not what they do KING HENRY Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking BURGUNDY I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summerd and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomewtide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on KING HENRY This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and

honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew my fathers ambition He was thinking of

Diomedes Menelaus and others AGAMEMNON Princes What grief hath set these jaundies oer your cheeks The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on earth below Fails in the promisd largeness checks and disasters Grow in the veins of actions highest reard As knots by the conflux of meeting sap Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth Nor princes is it matter new to us That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years siege yet Troy walls stand Sith every action that hath gone before Whereof we have record trial did draw Bias and thwart not answering the aim And that unbodied figure of the thought That gavet surmised shape Why then you princes Do you with cheeks abashd behold our works And call them shames which are indeed naught else But the protractive trials of great Jove To find persistive constancy in men The fineness of which metal is not found In fortunes love For then the bold and coward The wise and fool the artist and unread The hard and soft seem all affind and kin But in the wind and tempest of her frown Distinction with a broad and powerful fan Puffing at all winnows the light away And what hath mass or matter by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled NESTOR With due observance of thy godlike seat Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply Thy latest words In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth How many shallow bauble boats dare sail Upon her patient breast making their way With those of nobler bulk But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis and anon behold The strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut Bounding between the two moist elements Like Perseus horse Wheres then the saucy boat Whose weak untimberd sides but even now Corivalld greatness Either to harbour fled Or made a toast for Neptune Even so Doth valours show and valours worth divide In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks And flies fled under shadewhy then the thing of courage As rousd with rage with rage doth sympathise And with an accent tund in selfsame key Retorts to chiding fortune ULYSSES Agamemnon Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit In whom the tempers and the minds of all Should be shut uphear what Ulysses speaks Besides thapplause and approbation The which To Agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway To Nestor And thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life I give to both your speecheswhich were such As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece Should hold up high in brass and such again As venerable Nestor hatchd in silver Should with a bond of air strong as the axletree On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears To his experiencd tongueyet let it please both Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak AGAMEMNON Speak Prince of Ithaca and bet of less expect That matter needless of importless burden Divide thy lips than we are confident When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws We shall hear music wit and oracle ULYSSES Troy yet upon his basis had been down And the great Hectors sword had lackd a master But for these instances The specialty of rule hath been neglected And look how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions When that the general is not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair What honey is expected Degree being vizarded Thunworthiest shows as fairly in the mask The heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthrond and spherd Amidst the other whose medcinable eye Corrects the influence of evil planets And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shakd Which is the ladder of all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce from dividable shores The primogenity and due of birth Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels But by degree stand in authentic place Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing melts In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong Between whose endless jar justice resides Should lose their names and so should justice too Then everything includes itself in power Power into will will into appetite And appetite an universal wolf So doubly seconded with will and power Must make perforce an universal preyAnd last eat up himself Great Agamemnon This chaos when degree is suffocate Follows the choking And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward with a purpose It hath to climb The generals disdaind By him one step below he by the next That next by him beneath so every step Exampld by the first pace that is sick Of his superior grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation And tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot Not her own sinews To end a tale of length Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength NESTOR Most wisely hath Ulysses here discoverd The fever whereof all our power is sick AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedy ULYSSES The great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries Excellent Tis Agamemnon right Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration Thats doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies weight Why this hath not a fingers dignity They call this bedwork mappry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution NESTOR Let this be granted and Achilles horse Makes many Thetis sons Tucket AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus MENELAUS From Troy Enter Aeneas AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent AENEAS Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you AGAMEMNON Even this AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles arm Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals AGAMEMNON How AENEAS Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers AENEAS Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd As bending angels thats their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Joves accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praisd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends AGAMEMNON Sir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas AENEAS Ay Greek that is my name AGAMEMNON Whats your affairs I pray you AENEAS Sir pardon tis for Agamemnons ears AGAMEMNON He hears naught privately that comes from Troy AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him I bring a trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speak AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnons sleeping hour That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake He tells thee so himself AENEAS Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fairst of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That feeds his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none hell say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so much AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hectors grandsire suckd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put this witherd brawns And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood Ill prove this troth with my three drops of blood AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ULYSSES Amen AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you sir Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor ULYSSES Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape NESTOR What ist ULYSSES This tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be croppd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all NESTOR Well and how ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgement Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose Pointing on him ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you NESTOR Why tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute With their finst palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly poisd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large It is supposd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As twere from forth us all a man distilld Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertaind limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance theyll sell If not the lustre of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are doggd with two strange followers NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should share with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foild Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lottry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off Well dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our projects life this shape of sense assumes Ajax employd plucks down Achilles plumes NESTOR Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone Exeunt ACT II SCENE I The Grecian camp Enter Ajax and Thersites AJAX Thersites THERSITES Agamemnonhow if he had boils full all over generally AJAX

trash Farewell AJAX Farewell Who shall answer him ACHILLES I know not tis put to lottry otherwise He knew his man AJAX O meaning you I will go learn more of it Exeunt SCENE II Troy Priams palace Enter Priam Hector Troilus Paris and Helenus PRIAM After so many hours lives speeches spent Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks Deliver Helen and all damage else As honour loss of time travail expense Wounds friends and what else dear that is consumd In hot digestion of this cormorant war Shall be struck off Hector what say you tot HECTOR Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I As far as toucheth my particular Yet dread Priam There is no lady of more softer bowels More spongy to suck in the sense of fear More ready to cry out Who knows what follows Than Hector is The wound of peace is surety Surety secure but modest doubt is calld The beacon of the wise the tent that searches To th bottom of the worst Let Helen go Since the first sword was drawn about this question Every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes Hath been as dear as HelenI mean of ours If we have lost so many tenths of ours To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us Had it our name the value of one ten What merits in that reason which denies The yielding of her up TROILUS Fie fie my brother Weigh you the worth and honour of a king So great as our dread fathers in a scale Of common ounces Will you with counters sum The pastproportion of his infinite And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons Fie for godly shame HELENUS No marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons You are so empty of them Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason Because your speech hath none that tells him so TROILUS You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons You know an enemy intends you harm You know a sword employd is perilous And reason flies the object of all harm Who marvels then when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove Or like a star disorbd Nay if we talk of reason Lets shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honour Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts With this crammd reason Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject HECTOR Brother she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping TROILUS Whats aught but as tis valued HECTOR But value dwells not in particular will It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein tis precious of itself As in the prizer Tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the god And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects Without some image of thaffected merit TROILUS I take today a wife and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears Two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgement how may I avoid Although my will distaste what it elected The wife I chose There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soild them nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve Because we now are full It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks Your breath with full consent bellied his sails The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce And did him service He touchd the ports desird And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollos and makes stale the morning Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl Whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships And turnd crownd kings to merchants If youll avouch twas wisdom Paris went As you must needs for you all cried Go go If youll confess he brought home worthy prize As you must needs for you all clappd your hands And cried Inestimablewhy do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate And do a deed that never Fortune did Beggar the estimation which you prizd Richer than sea and land O theft most base That we have stoln what we do fear to keep But thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans cry PRIAM What noise what shriek is this TROILUS Tis our mad sister I do know her voice CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans HECTOR It is Cassandra Enter Cassandra raving CASSANDRA Cry Trojans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes And I will fill them with prophetic tears HECTOR Peace sister peace CASSANDRA Virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to comeCry Trojans cry Practise your eyes with tears Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all Cry Trojans cry A Helen and a woe Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go Exit HECTOR Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse Or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause Can qualify the same TROILUS Why brother Hector We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandras mad Her brainsick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engagd To make it gracious For my private part I am no more touchd than all Priams sons And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain PARIS Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels But I attest the gods your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project For what alas can these my single arms What propugnation is in one mans valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite Yet I protest Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will Paris should neer retract what he hath done Nor faint in the pursuit PRIAM Paris you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights You have the honey still but these the gall So to be valiant is no praise at all PARIS Sir I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wipd off in honourable keeping her What treason were it to the ransackd queen Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms Theres not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamd Where Helen is the subject Then I say Well may we fight for her whom we know well The worlds large spaces cannot parallel HECTOR Paris and Troilus you have both said well And on the cause and question now in hand Have glozd but superficially not much Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distempred blood Than to make up a free determination Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision Nature craves All dues be rendred to their owners Now What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection And that great minds of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills resist the same There is a law in each wellorderd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory If Helen then be wife to Spartas king As it is known she isthese moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back returnd Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong But makes it much more heavy Hectors opinion Is this in way of truth Yet neertheless My spritely brethren I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still For tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignities TROILUS Why there you touchd the life of our design Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector She is a theme of honour and renown A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds Whose present courage may beat down our foes And fame in time to come canonize us For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promisd glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide worlds revenue HECTOR I am yours You valiant offspring of great Priamus I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits I was advertisd their great general slept Whilst emulation in the army crept This I presume will wake him Exeunt SCENE III The Grecian camp Before the tent of Achilles Enter Thersites solus THERSITES How now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he raild at me Sfoot Ill learn to conjure and raise devils but Ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then theres Achilles a rare engineer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunderdarter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which shortarmd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan boneache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say Amen What ho my Lord Achilles Enter Patroclus PATROCLUS Whos there Thersites Good Thersites come in and rail THERSITES If I could a remembred a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slippd out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself The common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue Heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse Ill be sworn and sworn upont she never shrouded any but lazars Amen Wheres Achilles PATROCLUS What art thou devout Wast thou in prayer THERSITES Ay the heavens hear me PATROCLUS Amen Enter Achilles ACHILLES Whos there PATROCLUS Thersites my lord ACHILLES Where where O where Art thou come Why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals Come whats Agamemnon THERSITES Thy commander Achilles Then tell me"

both to impeach and purgeMyself condemned and myself excusd PRINCE Then say at once what thou dost know in this FRIAR LAWRENCE I will be brief for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet And she there dead that Romeos faithful wife I married them and their stoln marriage day Was Tybalts doomsday whose untimely death Banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pind You to remove that siege of grief from her Betrothd and would have married her perforce To County Paris Then comes she to me And with wild looks bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage Or in my cell there would she kill herself Then gave I her so tutored by my art A sleeping potion which so took effect As I intended for it wrought on her The form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowd grave Being the time the potions force should cease But he which bore my letter Friar John Was stayd by accident and yesternight Returnd my letter back Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindreds vault Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo But when I came some minute ere the time Of her awaking here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead She wakes and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience But then a noise did scare me from the tomb And she too desperate would not go with me But as it seems did violence on herself All this I know and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy And if ought in this Miscarried by my fault let my old life Be sacrificd some hour before his time Unto the rigour of severest law PRINCE We still have known thee for a holy man Wheres Romeos man What can he say to this BALTHASAR I brought my master news of Juliets death And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place to this same monument This letter he early bid me give his father And threatend me with death going in the vault If I departed not and left him there PRINCE Give me the letter I will look on it Where is the Countys Page that raisd the watch Sirrah what made your master in this place PAGE He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave And bid me stand aloof and so I did Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb And by and by my master drew on him And then I ran away to call the watch PRINCE This letter doth make good the Friars words Their course of love the tidings of her death And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor pothecary and therewithal Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet Where be these enemies Capulet Montague See what a scourge is laid upon your hate That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love And I for winking at your discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen All are punishd CAPULET O brother Montague give me thy hand This is my daughters jointure for no more Can I demand MONTAGUE But I can give thee more For I will raise her statue in pure gold That whiles Verona by that name is known There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet CAPULET As rich shall Romeos by his ladys lie Poor sacrifices of our enmity PRINCE A glooming peace this morning with it brings The sun for sorrow will not show his head Go hence

unburied yet To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx Make way to lay them by their brethren They open the tomb There greet in silence as the dead are wont And sleep in peace slain in your countrys wars O sacred receptacle of my joys Sweet cell of virtue and nobility How many sons hast thou of mine in store That thou wilt never render to me more LUCIUS Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths That we may hew his limbs and on a pile Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh Before this earthy prison of their bones That so the shadows be not unappeased Nor we disturbed with prodigies on earth TITUS I give him you the noblest that survives The eldest son of this distressed queen TAMORA Stay Roman brethren Gracious conqueror Victorious Titus rue the tears I shed A mothers tears in passion for her son And if thy sons were ever dear to thee O think my son to be as dear to me Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome To beautify thy triumphs and return Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets For valiant doings in their countrys cause O if to fight for king and commonweal Were piety in thine it is in these Andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods Draw near them then in being merciful Sweet mercy is nobilitys true badge Thricenoble Titus spare my firstborn son TITUS Patient yourself madam and pardon me These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld Alive and dead and for their brethren slain Religiously they ask a sacrifice To this your son is marked and die he must T appease their groaning shadows that are gone LUCIUS Away with him and make a fire straight And with our swords upon a pile of wood Lets hew his limbs till they be clean consumed Exeunt Titus sons with Alarbus TAMORA O cruel irreligious piety CHIRON Was never Scythia half so barbarous DEMETRIUS Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome Alarbus goes to rest and we survive To tremble under Titus threatning look Then madam stand resolved but hope withal The selfsame gods that armed the Queen of Troy With opportunity of sharp revenge Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent May favour Tamora the queen of Goths When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes Enter the sons of Andronicus again with bloody swords LUCIUS See lord and father how we have performed Our Roman rites Alarbus limbs are lopped And entrails feed the sacrificing fire Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky Remaineth naught but to inter our brethren And with loud larums welcome them to Rome TITUS Let it be so and let Andronicus Make this his latest farewell to their souls Sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb In peace and honour rest you here my sons Romes readiest champions repose you here in rest Secure from worldly chances and mishaps Here lurks no treason here no envy swells Here grow no damned drugs here are no storms No noise but silence and eternal sleep In peace and honour rest you here my sons Enter Lavinia LAVINIA In peace and honour live Lord Titus long My noble lord and father live in fame Lo at this tomb my tributary tears I render for my brethrens obsequies And at thy feet I

hue And name thee in election for the empire With these our latedeceased emperors sons Be candidatus then and put it on And help to set a head on headless Rome TITUS A better head her glorious body fits Than his that shakes for age and feebleness What should I don this robe and trouble you Be chosen with proclamations today Tomorrow yield up rule resign my life And set abroad new business for you all Rome I have been thy soldier forty years And led my countrys strength successfully And buried one and twenty valiant sons Knighted in field slain manfully in arms In right and service of their noble country Give me a staff of honour for mine age But not a sceptre to control the world Upright he held it lords that held it last MARCUS Titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery SATURNINUS Proud and ambitious tribune canst thou tell TITUS Patience Prince Saturninus SATURNINUS Romans do me right Patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not Till Saturninus be Romes emperor Andronicus would thou were shipped to hell Rather than rob me of the peoples hearts LUCIUS Proud Saturnine interrupter of the good That nobleminded Titus means to thee TITUS Content thee prince I will restore to thee The peoples hearts and wean them from themselves BASSIANUS Andronicus I do not flatter thee But honour thee and will do till I die My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends I will most thankful be and thanks to men Of noble minds is honourable meed TITUS People of Rome and peoples tribunes here I ask your voices and your suffrages Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus TRIBUNES To gratify the good Andronicus And gratulate his safe return to Rome The people will accept whom he admits TITUS Tribunes I thank you and this suit I make That you create your emperors eldest son Lord Saturnine whose virtues will I hope Reflect on Rome as Titans rays on earth And ripen justice in this commonweal Then if you will elect by my advice Crown him and say Long live our emperor MARCUS With voices and applause of every sort Patricians and plebeians we create Lord Saturninus Romes great emperor And say Long live our Emperor Saturnine A long flourish SATURNINUS Titus Andronicus for thy favours done To us in our election this day I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts And will with deeds requite thy gentleness And for an onset Titus to advance Thy name and honourable family

match I hold me highly honoured of your grace And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine King and commander of our commonweal The wide worlds emperor do I consecrate My sword my chariot and my prisoners Presents well worthy Romes imperious lord Receive them then the tribute that I owe Mine honours ensigns humbled at thy feet SATURNINUS Thanks noble Titus father of my life How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record and when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts Romans forget your fealty to me TITUS To Tamora Now madam are you prisoner to an emperor To him that for your

But go thy ways go give that changing piece To him that flourished for her with his sword A valiant soninlaw thou shalt enjoy One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome TITUS These words are razors to my wounded heart SATURNINUS And therefore lovely Tamora Queen of Goths That like the stately Phbe mongst her nymphs Dost overshine the gallantst dames of Rome If

brow of woe Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves Therefore our sometime sister now our queen Thimperial

worth Or thinking by our late dear brothers death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame Colleagued with this dream of his advantage He hath not faild to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father with all bonds of law To our most valiant brother So much for him Now for ourself and for this time of meeting Thus much the business is we have here writ

now my cousin Hamlet and my son HAMLET Aside A little more than kin and less than kind KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you HAMLET Not so my lord I am too much i the sun QUEEN Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust Thou knowst tis common all that lives must die Passing through nature to eternity HAMLET Ay madam it is common QUEEN If it be Why seems it so particular with thee HAMLET Seems madam Nay it is I know not seems Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother Nor customary suits of solemn black Nor windy suspiration of forcd breath No nor the fruitful river in the eye Nor the dejected haviour of the visage Together with all forms moods shows of grief That can denote me truly These indeed seem For they are actions that a man might play But I have that within which passeth show These but the trappings and the suits of woe KING Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet To give these mourning duties to your father But you must know your father lost a father That father lost lost his and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow But to persevere In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness Tis unmanly grief It shows a will most incorrect to heaven A heart unfortified a mind impatient An understanding simple and unschoold For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaven A fault against the dead a fault to nature To reason most absurd whose common theme Is death of fathers and who still hath cried From the first corse till he that died today This must be so

world Fie ont Oh fie tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely That it should come to this But two months deadnay not so much not two So excellent a king that was to this Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth Must I remember Why she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on and yet within a month Let me not think ontFrailty thy name is woman A little month or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor

am very glad to see youGood even sir But what in faith make you from Wittenberg HORATIO A truant disposition good my lord HAMLET I would not hear your enemy say so Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself I know you are no truant But what is your affair in Elsinore Well teach you to drink deep ere you depart HORATIO My lord I came to see your fathers funeral HAMLET I prithee do not mock me fellowstudent I think it was to see my mothers wedding HORATIO Indeed my lord it followd hard upon HAMLET Thrift thrift Horatio The funeral bakd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day Horatio My fathermethinks I see my father HORATIO Where my lord HAMLET In my minds eye Horatio HORATIO I saw him once he was a goodly king HAMLET He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon his like again HORATIO My lord I think I saw him yesternight HAMLET Saw Who HORATIO My lord the King your father HAMLET The King my father HORATIO Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you HAMLET For Gods love let me hear HORATIO Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus and Barnardo on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night Been thus encounterd A figure like your father Armed at point exactly cappie Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd By their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes Within his truncheons length whilst they distilld Almost to jelly with the act of fear Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did And I with them the third night kept the watch Where as they had deliverd both in time Form of the thing each word made true and good The apparition comes I knew your father These hands are not more like HAMLET But where was this MARCELLUS My lord upon the platform where we watch HAMLET Did you not speak to it HORATIO My lord I did But answer made it none yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion like as it would speak But even then the morning cock crew loud And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanishd from our sight HAMLET Tis very strange HORATIO As I do live my honourd lord tis true And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it HAMLET Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me Hold you the watch tonight MARCELLUS and BARNARDO We do my lord HAMLET Armd say you Both Armd my lord HAMLET From top to toe BOTH My lord from head to foot HAMLET Then saw you not his face HORATIO O yes my lord he wore his beaver up HAMLET What lookd he frowningly HORATIO A countenance more in sorrow than in anger HAMLET Pale or red HORATIO Nay very pale HAMLET And fixd his eyes upon you HORATIO Most constantly HAMLET I would I had been there HORATIO It would have much amazd you HAMLET Very like very like Stayd it long HORATIO While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred MARCELLUS and BARNARDO Longer longer HORATIO Not when I sawt HAMLET His beard was grizzled no HORATIO It was as I have seen it in his life A sable silverd HAMLET I will watch tonight Perchance twill walk again HORATIO I warrant you it will HAMLET If it assume my noble fathers person Ill speak to it though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace I pray you all If you have hitherto conceald this sight Let it be tenable in your silence still And whatsoever else shall hap tonight Give it an understanding but no tongue I will requite your loves So fare ye well Upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve Ill visit you ALL Our duty to your honour HAMLET Your loves as mine to you farewell Exeunt Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo My fathers spirit in arms All is not well I doubt some foul play would the night were come Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes Exit SCENE III A room in Poloniuss house Enter Laertes and Ophelia LAERTES My necessaries are embarkd Farewell And sister as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant do not sleep But let me hear from you OPHELIA Do you doubt that LAERTES For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood A violet in the youth of primy nature Forward not permanent sweet not lasting The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more OPHELIA No more but so LAERTES Think it no more For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will but you must fear His greatness weighd his will is not his own For he himself is subject to his birth He may not as unvalud persons do Carve for himself for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of this whole state And therefore must his choice be circumscribd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open To his unmasterd importunity Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sisterAnd keep you in the rear of your affection Out of the shot and danger of desire The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosd And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent Be wary then best safety lies in fear Youth to itself rebels though none else near OPHELIA I shall theffect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart But good my brother Do not as some ungracious pastors do Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whilst like a puffd and reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede LAERTES O fear me not I stay too long But here my father comes Enter Polonius A double blessing is a double grace Occasion smiles upon a second leave POLONIUS Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayd for There my blessing with you Laying his hand on Laertess head And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue Nor any unproportiond thought his act Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each newhatchd unfledgd comrade Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but being in Beart that thopposed may beware of thee Give every man thine ear but few thy voice Take each mans censure but reserve thy judgement Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy But not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that Neither a borrower nor a lender be For loan oft loses both itself and friend And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry This above all to thine own self be true And it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not then be false to any man Farewell my blessing season this in thee LAERTES Most humbly do I take my leave my lord POLONIUS The time invites you go your servants tend LAERTES Farewell Ophelia and remember well What I have said to you OPHELIA Tis in my memory lockd And you yourself shall keep the key of it LAERTES Farewell Exit POLONIUS What ist Ophelia he hath said to you OPHELIA So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet POLONIUS Marry well bethought Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous If it be soas so tis put on me And that in way of cautionI must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour What is between you Give me up the truth OPHELIA He hath my lord of late made many tenders Of his affection to me POLONIUS Affection Pooh You speak like a green girl Unsifted in such perilous circumstance Do you believe his tenders as you call them OPHELIA I do not know my lord what I should think POLONIUS Marry Ill teach you think yourself a baby That you have taen these tenders for true pay Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly Ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase Running it thusyoull tender me a fool OPHELIA My lord he hath importund me with love In honourable fashion POLONIUS Ay fashion you may call it go to go to OPHELIA And hath given countenance to his speech my lord With almost all the holy vows of heaven POLONIUS Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know When the blood burns how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter Giving more light than heat extinct in both Even in their promise as it is amaking You must not take for fire From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet Believe so much in him that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you In few Ophelia Do not believe his vows for they are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show But mere implorators of unholy suits Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds The better to beguile This is for all I would not in plain terms from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet Look tot I charge you come your ways OPHELIA I shall obey my lord Exeunt SCENE IV The platform Enter Hamlet Horatio and Marcellus HAMLET The air bites shrewdly it is very cold HORATIO It is a nipping and an eager air HAMLET What hour now HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve MARCELLUS No it is struck HORATIO Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk A flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within What does this mean my lord HAMLET The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge HORATIO Is it a custom HAMLET Ay marry ist And to my mind though I am native here And to the manner born it is a custom More honourd in the breach than the observance This heavyheaded revel east and west Makes us traducd and taxd of other nations They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition and indeed it takes From our achievements though performd at height The pith and marrow of our attribute So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them As in their birth wherein they are not guilty Since nature cannot choose his origin By their oergrowth of some complexion Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason Or by some habit that too much oerleavens The form of plausive mannersthat these men Carrying I say the stamp of one defect Being Natures livery or Fortunes star His virtues elsebe they as pure as grace As infinite as man may undergo Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal HORATIO Look my lord it comes Enter Ghost HAMLET Angels and ministers of grace defend us Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable Thou comst in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee Ill call thee Hamlet King father royal Dane O answer me Let me not burst in ignorance but tell Why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd Hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again What may this mean That thou dead corse again in complete steel Revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon Making night hideous and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls Say why is this Wherefore What should we do Ghost beckons Hamlet HORATIO It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment did desire To you alone MARCELLUS Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground But do not go with it HORATIO No by no means HAMLET It will not speak then will I follow it HORATIO Do not my lord HAMLET Why what should be the fear I do not set my life at a pins fee And for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing immortal as itself It waves me forth again Ill follow it HORATIO What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles oer his base into the sea And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness Think of it The very place puts toys of desperation Without more motive into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath HAMLET It waves me still Go on Ill follow thee MARCELLUS You shall not go my lord HAMLET Hold off your hands HORATIO Be ruld you shall not go HAMLET My fate cries out And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lions nerve Ghost beckons Still am I calld Unhand me gentlemen Breaking free from them By heaven Ill make a ghost of him that lets me I say awayGo on Ill follow thee Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet HORATIO He waxes desperate with imagination MARCELLUS Lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him HORATIO Have after To what issue will this come MARCELLUS Something is rotten in the state of Denmark HORATIO Heaven will direct it MARCELLUS Nay lets follow him Exeunt SCENE V A more remote part of the Castle Enter Ghost and Hamlet HAMLET Whither wilt thou lead me Speak Ill go no further GHOST Mark me HAMLET I will GHOST My hour is almost come When I to sulphrous and tormenting flames Must render up myself HAMLET Alas poor ghost GHOST Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold HAMLET Speak I am bound to hear GHOST So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear HAMLET What GHOST I am thy fathers spirit Doomd for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confind to fast in fires Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purgd away But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prisonhouse I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood List list O list If thou didst ever thy dear father love HAMLET O God GHOST Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder HAMLET Murder GHOST Murder most foul as in the best it is But this most foul strange and unnatural HAMLET Haste me to knowt that I with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love May sweep to my revenge GHOST I find thee apt And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear Tis given out that sleeping in my orchard A serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abusd but know thou noble youth The serpent that did sting thy fathers life Now wears his crown HAMLET O my prophetic soul Mine uncle GHOST Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast With witchcraft of his wit with traitorous giftsO wicked wit and gifts that have the power So to seducewon to his shameful lust The will of my most seemingvirtuous queen O Hamlet what a falling off was there From me whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine But virtue as it never will be movd Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven So lust though to a radiant angel linkd Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage But soft methinks I scent the morning air Brief let me be Sleeping within my orchard My custom always of the afternoon Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd like eager droppings into milk The thin and wholesome blood So did it mine And a most instant tetter barkd about Most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body Thus was I sleeping by a brothers hand Of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin Unhousled disappointed unaneld No reckoning made but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head O horrible O horrible most horrible If thou hast nature in thee bear it not Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest But howsoever thou pursust this act Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her Fare thee well at once The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire Adieu adieu adieu Remember me Exit HAMLET O all you host of heaven O earth What else And shall I couple hell O fie Hold my heart And you my sinews grow not instant old But bear me stiffly up Remember thee Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe Remember thee Yea from the table of my memory Ill wipe away all trivial fond records All saws of books all forms all pressures past That youth and observation copied there And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain Unmixd with baser matter Yes by heaven O most pernicious woman O villain villain smiling damned villain My tables Meet it is I set it down That one may smile and smile and be a villain At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark Writing So uncle there you are Now to my word It is Adieu adieu remember me I have swornt HORATIO and MARCELLUS Within My lord my lord MARCELLUS

For every man hath business and desire Such as it isand for my own poor part Look you Ill go pray HORATIO These are but wild and whirling words my lord HAMLET Im sorry they offend you heartily Yes

desire to know what is between us Oermastert as you may And now good friends As you are friends scholars and soldiers Give me one poor request HORATIO What ist my lord We will HAMLET Never make known

swear HORATIO Propose the oath my lord HAMLET Never to speak of this that you have seen Swear by my sword GHOST Beneath Swear HAMLET Hic et ubique Then well shift our ground Come hither gentlemen And lay your hands again upon my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard Swear by my sword GHOST Beneath Swear HAMLET Well said old mole Canst work i thearth so fast A worthy pioner Once more

Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo REYNALDO I will my lord POLONIUS You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo Before you visit him to make inquiry Of his behaviour REYNALDO My lord I did intend it POLONIUS Marry well said very well said Look you sir Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris And how and who what means and where they keep What company at what expense and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it Take you as twere some distant knowledge of him As thus I know his father and his friends And in part himdo you mark this Reynaldo REYNALDO Ay very well my lord POLONIUS And in part him but you may say not well But ift be he I mean hes very wild Addicted so and so and there put on him What forgeries you please marry none so rank As may dishonour him take heed of that But sir such wanton wild and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty REYNALDO As gaming my lord POLONIUS Ay or drinking fencing swearing Quarrelling drabbing You may go so far REYNALDO My lord that would dishonour him POLONIUS Faith no as you may season it in the charge You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency Thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind A savageness in unreclaimed blood Of general assault REYNALDO But my good lord POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this REYNALDO Ay my lord I would know that POLONIUS Marry sir heres my drift And I believe it is a fetch of warrant You laying these slight sullies on my son As twere a thing a little soild i th working Mark you Your party in converse him you would sound Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty be assurd He closes with you in this consequence Good sir or so or friend or gentleman According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country REYNALDO Very good my lord POLONIUS And then sir does he this He doesWhat was I about to say By the mass I was about to say something Where did I leave REYNALDO At closes in the consequence At friend or so and gentleman POLONIUS At closes in the consequence ay marry He closes with you thus I know the gentleman I saw him yesterday or tother day Or then or then with such and such and as you say There was he gaming there oertook ins rouse There falling out at tennis or perchance I saw him enter such a house of sale Videlicet a brothel or so forth See you now Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth And thus do we of wisdom and of reach With windlasses and with assays of bias By indirections find directions out So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son You have me have you not REYNALDO My lord I have POLONIUS God b wi you fare you well REYNALDO Good my lord POLONIUS Observe his inclination in yourself REYNALDO I shall my lord POLONIUS And let him ply his music REYNALDO Well my lord POLONIUS Farewell Exit Reynaldo Enter Ophelia How now Ophelia whats the matter OPHELIA Alas my lord I have been so affrighted POLONIUS With what in the name of God OPHELIA My lord as I was sewing in my chamber Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbracd No hat upon his head his stockings fould Ungartred and downgyved to his ankle Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me POLONIUS Mad for thy love OPHELIA My lord I do not know but truly I do fear it POLONIUS What said he OPHELIA He took me by the wrist and held me hard Then goes he to the length of all his arm And with his other hand thus oer his brow He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it Long stayd he so At lasta little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down He raisd a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being That done he lets me go And with his head over his shoulder turnd He seemd to find his way without his eyes For out o doors he went without their help And to the last bended their light on me POLONIUS Come go with me I will go seek the King This is the very ecstasy of loveWhose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures I am sorry What have you given him any hard words of late OPHELIA No my good lord but as you did command I did repel his letters and denied His access to me POLONIUS That hath made him mad I am sorry that with better heed and judgement I had not quoted him I feard he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee But beshrew my jealousy It seems it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion Come go we to the King This must be known which being kept close might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love Exeunt SCENE II A room in the Castle Enter King Queen Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Attendants KING Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Moreover that we much did long to see you The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending Something have you heard Of Hamlets transformation so I call it Since nor thexterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was What it should be More than his fathers death that thus hath put him So much from thunderstanding of himself I cannot dream of I entreat you both That being of so young days brought up with him And since so neighbourd to his youth and humour"

lies the scene From isles of Greece The princes orgulous their high blood chafd Have to the port of Athens sent their ships Fraught with the ministers and instruments Of cruel war Sixty and nine that wore Their crownets regal from the Athenian bay Put forth toward Phrygia and their vow is made To ransack Troy within whose strong immures The ravishd Helen Menelaus queen With wanton Paris sleepsand

Priams sixgated city Dardan and Tymbria Ilias Chetas Troien And Antenorides with massy staples And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts Stir up the sons of Troy Now expectation tickling skittish spirits On one and other side Trojan and Greek Sets all on hazard And hither am I come A prologue armd but not in confidence Of authors pen or actors voice but suited In like conditions as our argument To tell you fair beholders that our play Leaps oer the vaunt and firstlings of those broils Beginning in the middle starting thence away To what may be digested in a play Like or find fault do as your pleasures are Now good or bad tis but the chance of war ACT I SCENE I Troy Before Priams palace Enter Troilus armed and Pandarus TROILUS Call here my varlet Ill unarm again Why should I war without the walls of Troy That find such cruel battle here within Each Trojan that is master of his heart Let him to field Troilus alas hath none PANDARUS Will this gear neer be mended TROILUS The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant But I am weaker than a womans tear Tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance Less valiant than the virgin in the night And skilless as unpractisd infancy PANDARUS Well I have told you enough of this for my part Ill not meddle nor make no farther He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding TROILUS Have I not tarried PANDARUS Ay the grinding but you must tarry the bolting TROILUS Have I not tarried PANDARUS Ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening TROILUS Still have I tarried PANDARUS Ay to the leavening but heres yet in the word hereafter the kneading the making of the cake the heating of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too or you may chance burn your lips TROILUS Patience herself what goddess eer she be Doth lesser blench at suffrance than I do At Priams royal table do I sit And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts So traitor when she comes when she is thence PANDARUS Well she lookd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look or any woman else TROILUS I was about to tell thee when my heart As wedged with a sigh would rive in twain Lest Hector or my father should perceive me I have as when the sun doth light a storm Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile But sorrow that is couchd in seeming gladness Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadnessPANDARUS An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helens well go to there were no more comparison between the women But for my part she is my kinswoman I would not as they term it praise her but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did I will not dispraise your sister Cassandras wit but TROILUS O Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drownd Reply not in how many fathoms deep They lie indrenchd I tell thee I am mad In Cressids love Thou answerst She is fair Pourst in the open ulcer of my heart Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice Handlest in thy discourse O that her hand In whose comparison all whites are ink Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure The cygnets down is harsh and spirit of sense Hard as the palm of ploughman This thou tellst me As true thou tellst me when I say I love her But saying thus instead of oil and balm Thou layst in every gash that love hath given me The knife that made it PANDARUS I speak no more than truth TROILUS Thou dost not speak so much PANDARUS Faith Ill not meddle int Let her be as she is if she be fair tis the better for her and she be not she has the mends in her own hands TROILUS Good Pandarus How now Pandarus PANDARUS I have had my labour for my travail ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you gone between and between but small thanks for my

I will leave all as I found it and there an end Exit Pandarus An alarum TROILUS Peace you ungracious clamours Peace rude sounds Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair When with your blood you daily paint her thus I cannot fight upon this argument It is too starvd a subject for my sword But Pandarus O gods how do you plague me I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar And hes as tetchy to be wood to woo As she is stubbornchaste against all suit Tell me Apollo for thy Daphnes love What Cressid is what Pandar and what we Her bed is India there she lies a pearl Between our Ilium and where

Alexander CRESSIDA Who were those went by ALEXANDER Queen Hecuba and Helen CRESSIDA And whither go they ALEXANDER Up to the eastern tower Whose height commands as subject all the vale To see the battle Hector whose patience Is as a virtue fixd today was movd He chid Andromache and struck his armourer And like as there were husbandry in war Before the sun rose he was harnessd light And to the field goes he where every flower Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw In Hectors wrath CRESSIDA What was his cause of anger ALEXANDER The noise goes this there is among the Greeks A lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hector They call him Ajax CRESSIDA Good and what of him ALEXANDER They say he is a very man per se And stands alone CRESSIDA So do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs ALEXANDER This man lady hath robbd many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephanta man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushd into folly his folly sauced with discretion There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of everything but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight CRESSIDA But how should this man that makes me smile make Hector angry ALEXANDER They say he yesterday copd Hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking Enter Pandarus CRESSIDA Who comes here ALEXANDER Madam your uncle Pandarus CRESSIDA Hectors a gallant man ALEXANDER As may be in the world lady PANDARUS Whats that Whats that

not come far behind him let them take heed of Troilus I can tell them that too CRESSIDA What is he angry too PANDARUS Who Troilus Troilus is the better man of the two CRESSIDA O Jupiter theres no comparison PANDARUS What not between Troilus and Hector Do you know a man if you see him CRESSIDA Ay if I ever saw him before and knew him PANDARUS Well I say Troilus is Troilus CRESSIDA Then you say as I say for I am sure he is not Hector PANDARUS No nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees CRESSIDA Tis just to each of them he is himself PANDARUS Himself Alas poor Troilus I would he were CRESSIDA So he is PANDARUS Condition I had gone barefoot to India CRESSIDA He is not Hector PANDARUS Himself no hes not himself Would a were himself Well the gods are above time must friend or end Well Troilus well I would my heart were in her body No Hector is not a better man than Troilus CRESSIDA Excuse me PANDARUS He is elder CRESSIDA Pardon me pardon me PANDARUS Thothers not come tot you shall tell me another tale when thothers come tot Hector shall not have his wit this year CRESSIDA He shall not need it if he have his own ANDARUS Nor his qualities CRESSIDA No matter PANDARUS Nor his beauty CRESSIDA Twould not become him his owns better PANDARUS You have no judgement niece Helen herself swore thother day that Troilus for a brown favour for so tis I must confessnot brown neither CRESSIDA No but brown PANDARUS Faith to say truth brown and not brown CRESSIDA To say the truth true and not true PANDARUS She praisd his complexion above Paris CRESSIDA Why Paris hath colour enough PANDARUS So he has CRESSIDA Then Troilus should have too much If she praisd him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion I had as lief Helens golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose PANDARUS I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris CRESSIDA Then shes a merry Greek indeed PANDARUS Nay I am sure she does She came to him thother day into the compassd windowand you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin CRESSIDA Indeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total PANDARUS Why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector CRESSIDA Is he so young a man and so old a lifter PANDARUS But to prove to you that Helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin CRESSIDA Juno have mercy How came it cloven PANDARUS Why you know tis dimpled I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia CRESSIDA O he smiles valiantly PANDARUS Does he not CRESSIDA O yes an twere a cloud in autumn PANDARUS Why go to then But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus CRESSIDA Troilus will stand to the proof if youll prove it so PANDARUS Troilus Why he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg CRESSIDA If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i th shell PANDARUS I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin Indeed she has a marvells white hand I must needs confess CRESSIDA Without the rack PANDARUS And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin CRESSIDA Alas poor chin Many a wart is richer PANDARUS But there was such laughing Queen Hecuba laughd that her eyes ran oer CRESSIDA With millstones PANDARUS And Cassandra laughd CRESSIDA But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes Did her eyes run oer too PANDARUS And Hector laughd CRESSIDA At what was all this laughing PANDARUS Marry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus chin CRESSIDA Andt had been a green hair I should have laughd too PANDARUS They laughd not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer CRESSIDA What was his answer PANDARUS Quoth she Heres but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white CRESSIDA This is her question PANDARUS Thats true make no question of that Two and fifty hairs quoth he and one white That white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons Jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is Paris my husband The forked one quoth he pluckt out and give it him But there was such laughing and Helen so blushd and Paris so chafd and all the rest so laughd that it passd CRESSIDA So let it now for it has been a great while going by PANDARUS Well cousin I told you a thing yesterday think ont CRESSIDA So I do PANDARUS Ill be sworn tis true he will weep you and twere a man born in April CRESSIDA And Ill spring up in his tears an twere a nettle against May Sound a

ever knew Love got so sweet as when desire did sue Therefore this maxim out of love I teach Achievement is command ungaind beseech Then though my hearts content firm love doth bear Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear Exit SCENE III The Grecian camp Before Agamemnons tent Sennet Enter Agamemnon Nestor Ulysses Diomedes Menelaus and others AGAMEMNON Princes What grief hath set these jaundies oer your cheeks The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on earth below Fails in the promisd largeness checks and disasters Grow in the veins of actions highest reard As knots by the conflux of meeting sap Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth Nor princes is it matter new to us That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years siege yet Troy walls stand Sith every action that hath gone before Whereof we have record trial did draw Bias and thwart not answering the aim And that unbodied figure of the thought That gavet surmised shape Why then you princes Do you with cheeks abashd behold our works And call them shames which are indeed naught else But the protractive trials of great Jove To find persistive constancy in men The fineness of which metal is not found In fortunes love For then the bold and coward The wise and fool the artist and unread The hard and soft seem all affind and kin But in the wind and tempest of her frown Distinction with a broad and powerful fan Puffing at all winnows the light away And what hath mass or matter by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled NESTOR With due observance of thy godlike seat Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply Thy latest words In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth How many shallow bauble boats dare sail Upon her patient breast making their way With those of nobler bulk But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis and anon behold The strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut Bounding between the two moist elements Like Perseus horse Wheres then the saucy boat Whose weak untimberd sides but even now Corivalld greatness Either to harbour fled Or made a toast for Neptune Even so Doth valours show and valours worth divide In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks And flies fled under shadewhy then the thing of courage As rousd with rage with rage doth sympathise And with an accent tund in selfsame key Retorts to chiding fortune ULYSSES Agamemnon Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit In whom the tempers and the minds of all Should be shut uphear what Ulysses speaks Besides thapplause and approbation The which To Agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway To Nestor And thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life I give to both your speecheswhich were such As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece Should hold up high in brass and such again As venerable Nestor hatchd in silver Should with a bond of air strong as the axletree On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears To his experiencd tongueyet let it please both Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak AGAMEMNON Speak Prince of Ithaca and bet of less expect That matter needless of importless burden Divide thy lips than we are confident When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws We shall hear music wit and oracle ULYSSES Troy yet upon his basis had been down And the great Hectors sword had lackd a master But for these instances The specialty of rule hath been neglected And look how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions When that the general is not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair What honey is expected Degree being vizarded Thunworthiest shows as fairly in the mask The heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthrond and spherd Amidst the other whose medcinable eye Corrects the influence of evil planets And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shakd Which is the ladder of all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce from dividable shores The primogenity and due of birth Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels But by degree stand in authentic place Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing melts In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong Between whose endless jar justice resides Should lose their names and so should justice too Then everything includes itself in power Power into will will into appetite And appetite an universal wolf So doubly seconded with will and power Must make perforce an universal preyAnd last eat up himself Great Agamemnon This chaos when degree is suffocate Follows the choking And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward with a purpose It hath to climb The generals disdaind By him one step below he by the next That next by him beneath so every step Exampld by the first pace that is sick Of his superior grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation And tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot Not her own sinews To end a tale of length Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength NESTOR Most wisely hath Ulysses here discoverd The fever whereof all our power is sick AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedy ULYSSES The great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries Excellent Tis Agamemnon right Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration Thats doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies weight Why this hath not a fingers dignity They call this bedwork mappry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution NESTOR Let this be granted and Achilles horse Makes many Thetis sons Tucket AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus MENELAUS From Troy Enter Aeneas AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent AENEAS Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you AGAMEMNON Even this AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles arm Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals AGAMEMNON How AENEAS Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers AENEAS Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd As bending angels thats their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Joves accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praisd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends AGAMEMNON Sir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas AENEAS Ay Greek that is my name AGAMEMNON Whats your affairs I pray you AENEAS Sir pardon tis for Agamemnons ears AGAMEMNON He hears naught privately that comes from Troy AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him I bring a trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speak AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnons sleeping hour That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake He tells thee so himself AENEAS Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fairst of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That feeds his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none hell say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so much AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hectors grandsire suckd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put this witherd brawns And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood Ill prove this troth with my three drops of blood AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ULYSSES Amen AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you sir Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor ULYSSES Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape NESTOR What ist ULYSSES This tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be croppd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all NESTOR Well and how ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgement Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose Pointing on him ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you NESTOR Why tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute With their finst palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly poisd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large It is supposd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As twere from forth us all a man distilld Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertaind limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance theyll sell If not the lustre of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are doggd with two strange followers NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should share with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foild Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make"

his car And made an evening at the noontide prick YORK My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth A bird that will revenge upon you all And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven Scorning whateer you can afflict me with Why come you not What multitudes and fear CLIFFORD So cowards fight when they can fly no further So doves do peck the falcons piercing talons So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives Breathe out invectives gainst the officers YORK O Clifford but bethink thee once again And in thy thought oerrun my former time And if thou canst for blushing view this face And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this CLIFFORD I will not bandy with thee word for word But buckle with thee blows twice two for one QUEEN MARGARET Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitors life Wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland NORTHUMBERLAND Hold Clifford do not honour him so much To prick thy finger though to wound his heart What valour were it when a cur doth grin For one to thrust his hand between his teeth When he might spurn him with his foot away It is wars prize to take all vantages And ten to one is no impeach of valour They lay hands on York who struggles CLIFFORD Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin NORTHUMBERLAND So doth the cony struggle in the net York is taken

Clifford and Northumberland Come make him stand upon this molehill here That raught at mountains with outstretched arms Yet parted but the shadow with his hand What was it you that would be Englands king Was t you that revelled in our parliamentAnd made a preachment of your high descent Where are your mess of sons to back you now The wanton Edward and the lusty George And wheres that valiant crookback prodigy Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland Look York I stained this napkin with the blood That

to shame thee wert thou not shameless Thy father bears the type of King of Naples Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen Unless the adage must be verified That beggars mounted run their horse to death Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud But God he knows thy share

Enter Edward and Richard and their power EDWARD I wonder how our princely father scaped Or whether he be scaped away or no From Cliffords and Northumberlands pursuit Had he been taen we should have heard the news Had he been slain we should have heard the news Or had he scaped methinks we should have heard The happy tidings of his good escape How fares my brother Why is he so sad RICHARD I cannot joy until I be resolved Where our right valiant father is become I saw him in the battle range about And watched him how he singled Clifford forth Methought he bore him in the thickest troop As doth a lion in a herd of neat Or as a bear encompassed round with dogs Who having pinched a few and made them cry The rest stand all aloof and bark at him So fared our father with his enemies So fled his enemies my warlike father Methinks tis pride enough to be his son See how the morning opes her golden gates And takes her farewell of the glorious sun How well resembles it the prime of youth Trimmed like a younker prancing to his love EDWARD Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns RICHARD Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun Not separated with the racking clouds But severed in a pale clearshining sky See see they join embrace and seem to kiss As if they vowed some league inviolable Now are they but one lamp one light one sun In this the heaven figures some event EDWARD Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of I think it cites us brother to the field That we the sons of brave Plantagenet Each one already blazing by our meeds Should notwithstanding join our lights together And overshine the earth as this the world Whateer it bodes henceforward will I bear Upon my target three fair shining suns RICHARD Nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it You love the breeder better than the male Enter a Messenger blowing But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue MESSENGER Ah one that was a woeful lookeron When as the noble Duke of York was slain Your princely father and my loving lord EDWARD O speak no more for I have heard too much RICHARD Say how he died for I will hear it all MESSENGER Environed he was with many foes And stood against them as the hope of Troy Against the Greeks that would have entered Troy But Hercules himself must yield to odds And many strokes though with a little axe Hews down and fell the hardesttimbered oak By many hands your father was subdued But only slaughtered by the ireful arm Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite Laughed in his face and when with grief he wept The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain And after many scorns many foul taunts They took his head and on the gates of York They set the same and there it doth remain The saddest spectacle that eer I viewed EDWARD Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay O Clifford boisterous Clifford thou hast slain The flower of Europe for his chivalry And treacherously hast thou vanquished him For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee Now my souls palace is become a prison Ah would she break from hence that this my body Might in the ground be closed up in rest For never henceforth shall I joy again Never O never shall I see more joy RICHARD I cannot weep for all my bodys moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart Nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen For selfsame wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast And burns me up with flames that tears would quench To weep is to make less the depth of grief Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me Richard I bear thy name Ill venge thy death Or die renowned by attempting it EDWARD His name that valiant duke hath left with thee His dukedom and his chair with me is left RICHARD Nay if thou be that princely eagles bird Show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say Either that is thine or else thou wert not his March Enter Warwick Marquess Montague and their army WARWICK How now fair lords What fare What news abroad RICHARD Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount Our baleful news and at each words deliverance Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told The words would add more anguish than the wounds O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain EDWARD O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet Which held thee dearly as his souls redemption Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death WARWICK Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears And now to add more measure to your woes I come to tell you things sith then befalln After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run Were brought me of your loss and his depart I then in London keeper of the King Mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends And very well appointed as I thought Marched toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen Bearing the King in my behalf along For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in Parliament Touching King Henrys oath and your succession Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met Our battles joined and both sides fiercely foughtBut whether twas the coldness of the King Who looked full gently on his warlike Queen That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen Or whether twas report of her success Or more than common fear of Cliffords rigour Who thunders to his captives blood and death I cannot judge but to conclude with truth Their weapons like to lightning came and went Our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight Or like an idle thresher with a flail Fell gently down as if they struck their friends I cheered them up with justice of our cause With promise of high pay and great rewards But all in vain they had no heart to fight And we in them no hope to win the day So that we fled the King unto the Queen Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself In haste posthaste are come to join with you For in the Marches here we heard you were Making another head to fight again EDWARD Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick And when came George from Burgundy to England WARWICK Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers And for your brother he was lately sent From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy With aid of soldiers to this needful war RICHARD Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit But neer till now his scandal of retire WARWICK Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine Can pluck the diadem from faint Henrys head And wring the awful sceptre from his fist Were he as famous and as bold in war As he is famed for mildness peace and prayer RICHARD I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak But in this troublous time whats to be done Shall we go throw away our coats of steel And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns Numbering our AveMaries with our beads Or shall we on the helmets of our foes Tell our devotion with revengeful arms If for the last say ay and to it lords WARWICK Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out And therefore comes my brother Montague Attend me lords The proud insulting Queen With Clifford and the haught Northumberland And of their feather many moe proud birds Have wrought the easymelting King like wax He swore consent to your succession His oath enrolled in the Parliament And now to London all the crew are gone To frustrate both his oath and what beside May make against the house of Lancaster Their power I think is thirty thousand strong Now if the help of Norfolk and myself With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure Will but amount to five and twenty thousand Why via to London will we march amain And once again bestride our foaming steeds And once again cry Charge upon our foes But never once again turn back and fly RICHARD Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak Neer may he live to see a sunshine day That cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay EDWARD Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean And when thou failstas God forbid the hour Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend WARWICK No longer Earl of March but Duke of York The next degree is Englands royal throne For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed In every borough as we pass along And he that throws not up his cap for joy Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head King Edward valiant Richard Montague Stay we no longer dreaming of renown But sound the trumpets and about our task RICHARD Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds I come to pierce it or to give thee mine EDWARD Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us Enter a

brave warriors lets away Exeunt SCENE II Before York Flourish Enter King Henry Queen Margaret the Prince of Wales Clifford and Northumberland with drums and trumpets QUEEN MARGARET Welcome my lord to this brave town of York Yonders the head of that archenemy That sought to be encompassed with your crown Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord KING HENRY Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack To see this sight it irks my very soul Withhold revenge dear God Tis not my fault Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow CLIFFORD My gracious liege this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside To whom do lions cast their gentle looks Not to the beast that would usurp their den Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick Not his that spoils her young before her face Who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting Not he that sets his foot upon her back The smallest worm will turn being trodden on And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood Ambitious York did level at thy crown Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows He but a duke would have his son a king And raise his issue like a loving sire Thou being a king blest with a goodly son Didst yield consent to disinherit him Which argued thee a most unloving father Unreasonable creatures feed their young And though mans face be fearful to their eyes Yet in protection of their tender ones Who hath not seen them even with those wings Which sometime they have used with fearful flight Make war with him that climbed unto their nest Offering their own lives in their youngs defence For shame my liege make them your precedent Were it not pity that this goodly boy Should lose his birthright by his fathers fault And long hereafter say unto his child What my greatgrandfather and grandsire got My careless father fondly gave away Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy And let his manly face which promiseth Successful fortune steel thy melting heart To hold thine own and leave thine own with him KING HENRY Full well hath Clifford played the orator Inferring arguments of mighty force But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear That things ill got had ever bad success And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell Ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind And would my father had left me no more For all the rest is held at such a rate As brings a thousandfold more care to keep Than in possession any jot of pleasure Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know How it doth grieve me that thy head is here QUEEN MARGARET My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh And this soft courage makes your followers faint You promised knighthood to our forward son Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently Edward kneel down KING HENRY Edward Plantagenet arise a knight And learn this lesson draw thy sword in right PRINCE EDWARD My gracious father by your kingly leave Ill draw it as apparent to the crown And in that quarrel use it to the death CLIFFORD Why that is spoken like a toward prince Enter a Messenger MESSENGER Royal commanders be in readiness For with a band of thirty thousand men Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York And in the towns as they do march along Proclaims him king and many fly to him Darraign your battle for they are at hand CLIFFORD I would your highness would depart the field The Queen hath best success when you are absent QUEEN MARGARET Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune KING HENRY Why thats my fortune too therefore Ill stay NORTHUMBERLAND Be it with resolution then to fight PRINCE EDWARD My royal father cheer these noble lords And hearten those that fight in your defence Unsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George March Enter Edward George Richard Warwick Norfolk Montague and Soldiers EDWARD Now perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for grace And set thy diadem upon my head Or bide the mortal fortune of the field QUEEN MARGARET Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king EDWARD I am his king and he should bow his knee I was adopted heir by his consent Since when his oath is broke for as I hear You that are king though he do wear the crown Have caused him by new act of Parliament To blot out me and put his own son in CLIFFORD And reason too Who should succeed the father but the son RICHARD Are you there butcher O I cannot speak CLIFFORD Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee Or any he the proudest of thy sort RICHARD Twas you that killed young Rutland was it not CLIFFORD Ay and old York and yet not satisfied RICHARD For Gods sake lords give signal to the fight WARWICK What sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown QUEEN MARGARET Why how now longtongued Warwick dare you speak When you and I met at Saint Albans last Your legs did better service than your hands WARWICK Then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine CLIFFORD You said so much before and yet you fled WARWICK Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence NORTHUMBERLAND No nor your manhood that durst make you stay RICHARD Northumberland I hold thee reverently Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain The execution of my bigswoln heart Upon that Clifford that cruel childkiller CLIFFORD I slew thy father callst thou him a child RICHARD Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland But ere sunset Ill make thee curse the deed KING HENRY Have done with words my lords and hear me speak QUEEN MARGARET Defy them then or else hold close thy lips KING HENRY I prithee give no limits to my tongue I am a king and privileged to speak CLIFFORD My liege the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cured by words therefore be still RICHARD Then executioner unsheathe thy sword By Him that made us all I am resolved That Cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue EDWARD Say Henry shall I have my right or no A thousand men have broke their fasts today That neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown WARWICK If thou deny their blood upon thy head For York in justice puts his armour on PRINCE EDWARD If that be right which Warwick says is right There is no wrong but everything is right RICHARD Whoever got thee there thy mother stands For well I wot thou hast thy mothers tongue QUEEN MARGARET But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam But like a foul misshapen stigmatic Marked by the Destinies to be avoided As venom toads or lizards dreadful stings RICHARD Iron of Naples hid with English gilt Whose father bears the title of a kingAs if a channel should be called the sea Shamst thou not knowing whence thou art extraught To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart EDWARD A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns To make this shameless callet know herself Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou Although thy husband may be Menelaus And neer was Agamemnons brother wronged By that false woman as this king by thee His father revelled in the heart of France And tamed the King and made the Dauphin stoop And had he matched according to his state He might have kept that glory to this day But when he took a beggar to his bed And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him That washed his fathers fortunes forth of France And heaped sedition on his crown at home For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept And we in pity of the gentle king Had slipped our claim until another age GEORGE But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring And that thy summer bred us no increase We set the axe to thy usurping root And though the edge hath something hit ourselves Yet know thou since we have begun to strike Well never leave till we have hewn thee down Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods EDWARD And in this resolution I defy thee Not willing any longer conference Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak Sound trumpets Let our bloody colours wave And either victory or else a grave QUEEN MARGARET Stay Edward EDWARD No wrangling woman well no longer stay These words will cost ten thousand lives this day Exeunt SCENE III A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in Yorkshire Alarums Excursions Enter Warwick WARWICK Forspent with toil as runners with a race I lay me down a little while to breathe For strokes received and many blows repaid Have robbed my strongknit sinews of their strength And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile Enter Edward running EDWARD Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death For this world frowns and Edwards sun is clouded WARWICK How now my lord what hap What hope of good Enter George GEORGE Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us What counsel give you Whither shall we fly EDWARD Bootless is flight they follow us with wings And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit Enter Richard RICHARD Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself Thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk Broached with the steely point of Cliffords lance And in the very pangs of death he cried Like to a dismal clangor heard from far Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death So underneath the belly of their steeds That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood The noble gentleman gave up the ghost WARWICK Then let the earth be drunken with our blood Ill kill my horse because I will not fly Why stand we like softhearted women here Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage And look upon as if the tragedy Were played in jest by counterfeiting actors Here on my knee I vow to God above Ill never pause again never stand still Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine Or Fortune given me measure of revenge EDWARD O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine And in this vow do chain my soul to thine And ere my knee rise from the earths cold face I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee Thou setter up and plucker down of kings Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands That to my foes this body must be prey Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope And give sweet passage to my sinful soul Now lords take leave until we meet again Whereer it be in heaven or in earth RICHARD Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick Let me embrace thee in my weary arms I that did never weep now melt with woe That winter should cut off our springtime so WARWICK Away away Once more sweet lords farewell GEORGE Yet let us all together to our troops And give them leave to fly that will not stay And call them pillars that will stand to us And if we thrive promise them such rewards As victors wear at the Olympian games This may plant courage in their quailing breasts For yet is hope of life and victory Forslow no longer make we hence amain Exeunt SCENE IV Another Part of the Field Excursions Enter Richard and Clifford RICHARD Now Clifford I have singled thee alone Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York And this for Rutland both bound to revenge Wert thou environed with a brazen wall CLIFFORD Now Richard I am with thee here alone This is the hand that stabbed thy father York And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland And heres the heart that triumphs in their death And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother To execute the like upon thyself And so have at thee They fight Warwick comes Clifford flies RICHARD Nay Warwick single out some other chase For I myself will hunt this wolf to death Exeunt SCENE V Another Part of the Field Enter King Henry KING HENRY This battle fares like to the mornings war When dying clouds contend with growing light What time the shepherd blowing of his nails Can neither call it perfect day nor night Now sways it this way like a mighty sea Forced by the tide to combat with the wind Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea Forced to retire by fury of the wind Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind Now one the better then another best Both tugging to be victors breast to breast Yet neither conqueror nor conquered So is the equal poise of this fell war Here on this molehill will I sit me down To whom God will there be the victory For Margaret my queen and Clifford too Have chid me from the battle swearing both They prosper best of all when I am thence Would I were dead if Gods good will were so For what is in this world but grief and woe O God Methinks it were a happy life To be no better than a homely swain To sit upon a hill as I do now To carve out dials quaintly point by point Thereby to see the minutes how they run How many make the hour full complete How many hours brings about the day How many days will finish up the year How many years a mortal man may live When this is known then to divide the times So many hours must I tend my flock So many hours must I take my rest So many hours must I contemplate So many hours must I sport myself So many days my ewes have been with young So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean So many years ere I shall shear the fleece So minutes hours days months and years Passed over to the end they were created Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave Ah what a life were this How sweet how lovely Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep Than doth a rich embroidered canopy To kings that fear their subjects treachery O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth And to conclude the shepherds homely curds His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle His wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade All which secure and sweetly he enjoys Is far beyond a princes delicates His viands sparkling in a golden cup His body couched in a curious bed When care mistrust and treason waits on him Alarum Enter a Son that hath killed his father bringing in the dead body SON Ill blows the wind that profits nobody This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight May be possessed with some store of crowns And I that haply take them from him now May yet ere night yield both my life and them To some man else as this dead man doth me Whos this O God It is my fathers face Whom in this conflict I unwares have killed O heavy times begetting such events From London by the King was I pressed forth My father being the Earl of Warwicks man Came on the part of York pressed by his master And I who at his hands received my life Have by my hands of life bereaved him Pardon me God I knew not what I did And pardon father for I knew not thee My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks And no more words till they have flowed their fill KING HENRY O piteous spectacle O bloody times Whiles lions war and battle for their dens Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity Weep wretched man Ill aid thee tear for tear And let our hearts and eyes like civil war Be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief Enter a Father who has killed his son with the body in his arms FATHER Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold For I have bought it with an hundred blows But let me see is this our foemans face Ah no no no it is mine only son Ah boy if any life be left in thee Throw up thine eye See see what showers arise Blown with the windy tempest of my heart Upon thy wounds that kill mine eye and heart O pity God this miserable age What stratagems how fell how butcherly Erroneous mutinous and unnatural This deadly quarrel daily doth beget O boy thy father gave thee life too soon And hath bereft thee of thy life too late KING HENRY Woe above woe grief more than common grief O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds O pity pity gentle heaven pity The red rose and the white are on his face The fatal colours of our striving houses The one his purple blood right well resembles The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth Wither one rose and let the other flourish If you contend a thousand lives must wither SON How will my mother for a fathers death Take on with me and neer be satisfied FATHER How will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and neer be satisfied KING HENRY How will the country for these woeful chances Misthink the King and not be satisfied SON Was ever son so rued a fathers death FATHER Was ever father so bemoaned his son KING HENRY Was ever king so grieved for subjects woe Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much SON Ill bear thee hence where I may weep my fill Exit with the body FATHER These arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre For from my heart thine image neer shall go My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell And so obsequious will thy father be Even for the loss of thee having no more As Priam was for all his valiant sons Ill bear thee hence and let them fight that will For I have murdered where I should not kill Exit with the body KING HENRY Sadhearted men much overgone with care Here sits a king more woeful than you are Alarums Excursions Enter Queen Margaret Prince of Wales and ExeterPRINCE EDWARD Fly father fly for all your friends are fled And Warwick rages like a chafed bull Away for death doth hold us in pursuit QUEEN MARGARET Mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds Having the fearful flying hare in sight With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath And bloody steel grasped in their ireful hands Are at our backs and therefore hence amain EXETER Away for vengeance comes along with them Nay stay not to expostulate make speed Or else come after Ill away before KING HENRY Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter Not that I fear to stay but love to go Whither the Queen intends Forward away Exeunt SCENE VI Another Part of the Field A loud alarum Enter Clifford wounded CLIFFORD Here burns my candle out ay here it dies Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow More than my bodys parting with my soul My love and fear glued many friends to thee And now I fall thy tough commixtures melts Impairing Henry strengthening misproud York The common people swarm like summer flies And whither fly the gnats but to the sun And who shines now but Henrys enemies O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent That Phathon should check thy fiery steeds Thy burning car never had scorched the earth And Henry hadst thou swayed as kings should do Or as thy father and his father did Giving no ground unto the house of York They never then had sprung like summer flies I and ten thousand in this luckless realm Had left no mourning widows for our death And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight The foe is merciless and will not pity For at their hands I have deserved no pity The air hath got into my deadly wounds And much effuse of blood doth make me faint Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest I stabbed your fathers bosoms split my breast He faints Alarum and retreat Enter Edward George Richard Montague Warwick and Soldiers EDWARD Now breathe we lords Good fortune bids us pause And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks Some troops pursue the bloodyminded Queen That led calm Henry though he were a king As doth a sail filled with a fretting gust Command an argosy to stem the waves But think you lords that Clifford fled with them WARWICK No tis impossible he should escape For though before his face I speak the words Your brother Richard marked him for the grave And wheresoer he is hes surely dead Clifford groans and dies RICHARD Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave A deadly groan like life and deaths departing EDWARD See who it is and now the battles ended If friend or foe let him be gently used RICHARD Revoke that doom of mercy for tis Clifford Who not contented that he lopped the branch In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth But set his murdering knife unto the root From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring I mean our princely father Duke of York WARWICK From off the gates of York fetch down the head Your fathers head which Clifford placed there Instead whereof let this supply the room Measure for measure must be answered EDWARD Bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house That nothing sung but death to us and ours Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound And his illboding tongue no more shall speak Soldiers bring the body forward WARWICK I think his understanding is bereft Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee Dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life And he nor sees nor hears us what we say RICHARD O would he did and so perhaps he doth Tis but his policy to counterfeit Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our father GEORGE If so thou thinkst vex him with eager words RICHARD Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace EDWARD Clifford repent in bootless penitence WARWICK Clifford devise excuses for thy faults GEORGE While we devise"

fever she Reigns in my blood and will remembered be BEROWNE A fever in your blood Why then incision Would let her out in saucers Sweet misprision DUMAINE Once more Ill read the ode that I have writ BEROWNE Once more Ill mark how love can vary wit DUMAINE Dumaine reads his sonnet On a dayalack the day Love whose month is ever May Spied a blossom passing fair Playing in the wanton air Through the velvet leaves the wind All unseen can passage find That the lover sick to death Wished himself the heavens breath Air quoth he thy cheeks may blow Air would I might triumph so But alack my hand is sworn Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn Vow alack for youth unmeet Youth so apt to pluck a sweet Do not call it sin in me That I am forsworn for thee Thou for whom Jove would swear Juno but an Ethiope were And deny himself for Jove Turning mortal for thy love This will I send and something else more plain That shall express my true loves fasting pain O would the King Berowne and Longaville Were lovers too Ill to example ill Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note For none offend where all alike do dote LONGAVILLE Comes forward Dumaine thy love is far from charity That in loves grief desirst society You may look pale but I should blush I know To be oerheard and taken napping so KING Comes forward Come sir you blush As his your case is such You chide at him offending twice as much You do not love Maria Longaville Did never sonnet for her sake compile Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart His loving bosom to keep down his heart I have been closely shrouded in this bush And marked you both and for you both did blush I heard your guilty rhymes observed your fashion Saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion Ay me says one O Jove the other cries One her hairs were gold crystal the others eyes To Longaville You would for paradise break faith and troth To Dumaine And Jove for your love would infringe an oath What will Berowne say when that he shall hear Faith infringed which such zeal did swear How will he scorn how will he spend his wit How will he triumph leap and laugh at it For all the wealth that ever I did see I would not have him know so much by me BEROWNE Comes forward Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy Ah good my liege I pray thee pardon me Good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove These worms for loving that art most in love Your eyes do make no coaches in your tears There is no certain princess that appears Youll not be perjured tis a hateful thing Tush none but minstrels like of sonneting But are you not ashamed Nay are you not All three of you to be thus much oershot You found his mote the King your mote did see But I a beam do find in each of three O what a scene of foolery have I seen Of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen O me with what strict patience have I sat To see a king transformed to a gnat To see great Hercules whipping a gig And profound Solomon to tune a jig And Nestor play at pushpin with the boys And critic Timon laugh at idle toys Where lies thy grief O tell me good Dumaine And gentle Longaville where lies thy pain And where my lieges All about the breast A caudle ho KING Too bitter is thy jest Are we betrayed thus to thy overview BEROWNE Not you to me but I betrayed by you I that am honest I that hold it sin To break the vow I am engaged in I am betrayed by keeping company With men like you men of inconstancy When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme Or groan for Joan Or spend a minutes time In pruning me When shall you hear that I Will praise a hand a foot a face an eye A gait a state a brow a breast a waist A leg a limb KING Soft Whither away so fast A true man or a thief that gallops so BEROWNE I post from love Good lover let me go Enter Jaquenetta with a letter and Costard JAQUENETTA God bless the King KING What present hast thou there COSTARD Some certain treason KING What makes treason here COSTARD Nay it makes nothing sir KING If it mar nothing neither The treason and you go in peace away together JAQUENETTA I beseech your Grace let this letter be read Our person misdoubts it twas treason he said KING Berowne read it over Berowne reads the letter Where hadst thou it JAQUENETTA Of Costard KING Where hadst thou it COSTARD Of Dun Adramadio Dun Adramadio Berowne tears the letter KING How now what is in you Why dost thou tear it BEROWNE A toy my liege a toy Your Grace needs not fear it LONGAVILLE It did move him to passion and therefore lets hear it DUMAINE Picking up the pieces It is Berownes writing and here is his name BEROWNE To Costard Ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born to do me shame Guilty my lord guilty I confess I confess KING What BEROWNE That you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess He he and youand you my liegeand I Are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die O dismiss this audience and I shall tell you more DUMAINE Now the number is even BEROWNE True true we are four Will these turtles be gone KING Hence sirs away COSTARD Walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay Exeunt Costard and Jaquenetta BEROWNE Sweet lords sweet lovers O let us embrace As true we are as flesh and blood can beThe sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face Young blood doth not obey an old decree We cannot cross the cause why we were born Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn KING What did these rent lines show some love of thine BEROWNE Did they quoth you Who sees the heavenly Rosaline That like a rude and savage man of Ind At the first opning of the gorgeous east Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind Kisses the base ground with obedient breast What peremptory eaglesighted eye Dares look upon the heaven of her brow That is not blinded by her majesty KING What zeal what fury hath inspired thee now My love her mistress is a gracious moon She an attending star scarce seen a light BEROWNE My eyes are then no eyes nor I Berowne O but for my love day would turn to night Of all complexions the culled sovereignty Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek Where several worthies make one dignity Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues Fie painted rhetoric O she needs it not To things of sale a sellers praise belongs She passes praise then praise too short doth blot A withered hermit fivescore winters worn Might shake off fifty looking in her eye Beauty doth varnish age as if new born And gives the crutch the cradles infancy O tis the sun that maketh all things shine KING By heaven thy love is black as ebony BEROWNE Is ebony like her O word divine A wife of such wood were felicity O who can give an oath Where is a book That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack If that she learn not of her eye to look No face is fair that is not full so black KING O paradox Black is the badge of hell The hue of dungeons and the school of night And beautys crest becomes the heavens well BEROWNE Devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light O if in black my ladys brows be decked It mourns that painting and usurping hair Should ravish doters with a false aspect And therefore is she born to make black fair Her favour turns the fashion of the days For native blood is counted painting now And therefore red that would avoid dispraise Paints itself black to imitate her brow DUMAINE To look like her are chimneysweepers black LONGAVILLE And since her time are colliers counted bright KING And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack DUMAINE Dark needs no candles now for dark is light BEROWNE Your mistresses dare never come in rain For fear their colours should be washed away KING Twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain Ill find a fairer face not washed today BEROWNE Ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here KING No devil will fright thee then so much as she DUMAINE I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear LONGAVILLE Showing his shoe Look heres thy love my foot and her face see BEROWNE O if the streets were paved with thine eyes Her feet were much too dainty for such tread DUMAINE O vile Then as she goes what upward lies The street should see as she walked over head KING But what of this Are we not all in love BEROWNE Nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn KING Then leave this chat and good Berowne now prove Our loving lawful and our faith not torn DUMAINE Ay marry there some flattery for this evil LONGAVILLE O some authority how to proceed Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil DUMAINE Some salve for perjury BEROWNE O tis more than need Have at you then affections menatarms Consider what you first did swear unto To fast to study and to see no woman Flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth Say can you fast Your stomachs are too young And abstinence engenders maladies O we have made a vow to study lords And in that vow we have forsworn our books For when would you my liege or you or you In leaden contemplation have found out Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes Of beautys tutors have enriched you with Other slow arts entirely keep the brain And therefore finding barren practisers Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil But love first learned in a ladys eyes Lives not alone immured in the brain But with the motion of all elements Courses as swift as thought in every power And gives to every power a double power Above their functions and their offices It adds a precious seeing to the eye A lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind A lovers ear will hear the lowest sound When the suspicious head of theft is stopped Loves feeling is more soft and sensible Than are the tender horns of cockled snails Loves tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste For valour is not Love a Hercules Still climbing trees in the Hesperides Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical As bright Apollos lute strung with his hair And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods Make heaven drowsy with the harmony Never durst poet touch a pen to write Until his ink were tempered with Loves sighs O then his lines would ravish savage ears And plant in tyrants mild humility From womens eyes this doctrine I derive They sparkle still the right Promethean fire They are the books the arts the academes That show contain and nourish all the world Else none at all in aught proves excellent Then fools you were these women to forswear Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools For wisdoms sake a word that all men love Or for loves sake a word that loves all men Or for mens sake the authors of these women Or womens sake by whom we men are men Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths It is religion to be thus forsworn For charity itself fulfils the law And who can sever love from charity KING Saint Cupid then and soldiers to the field BEROWNE Advance your standards and upon them lords Pellmell down with them But be first advised In conflict that you get the sun of them LONGAVILLE Now to plain dealing Lay these glozes by Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France KING And win them too Therefore let us devise Some entertainment for them in their tents BEROWNE First from the park let us conduct them thither Then homeward every man attach the hand Of his fair mistress In the afternoon We will with some strange pastime solace them Such as the shortness of the time can shape For revels dances masques and merry hours Forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowers KING Away away No time shall be omitted That will betime and may by us be fitted BEROWNE Allons allons Sowed cockle reaped no corn And justice always whirls in equal measure Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn If so our copper buys no better treasure Exeunt ACT V SCENE I The King of Navarres park Enter Holofernes Sir Nathaniel

torch I am not for this ambling Being but heavy I will bear the light MERCUTIO Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance ROMEO Not I believe me you have dancing shoes With nimble soles I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move MERCUTIO You are a lover borrow Cupids wings And soar with them above a common bound ROMEO I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe Under loves heavy burden do I sink MERCUTIO And to sink in it should you burden love Too great oppression for a tender thing ROMEO Is love a tender thing It is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn MERCUTIO If love be rough with you be rough with love Prick love for pricking and you beat love down Give me a case to put my visage in Putting on a mask A visor for a visor What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities Here are the beetlebrows shall blush for me BENVOLIO Come knock and enter and no sooner in But

That dreamers often lie ROMEO In bed asleep while they do dream things true MERCUTIO O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you She is the fairies midwife and she comes In shape no bigger than an agatestone On the forefinger of an alderman Drawn with a team of little atomies Over mens noses as they lie asleep Her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs The cover of the wings of grasshoppers Her traces of the smallest spiders web The collars of the moonshines watery beams Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film Her waggoner a small greycoated gnat Not half so big as a round little worm Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains and then they dream of love Oer courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees Oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep Then dreams he of another benefice Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats Of breaches ambuscados Spanish blades Of healths five fathom deep and then anon Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs Which once untangled much misfortune bodes This is the hag when maids lie on their backs That presses them and learns them first to bear Making them women of good carriage This is she ROMEO Peace peace Mercutio peace Thou talkst of nothing MERCUTIO True I talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Begot of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north And being angerd puffs away from thence Turning his side to the dewdropping south BENVOLIO This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves Supper is done and we shall come too lateROMEO I fear too early for my mind misgives Some consequence

heir That fair for which love groand for and would die With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair Now Romeo is belovd and loves again Alike bewitched by the charm of looks But to his foe supposd he must complain And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks Being held a foe he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear And she as much in love her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere But passion lends them power time means to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet Exit SCENE I An open place adjoining Capulets Garden Enter Romeo ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out He climbs the wall and leaps down within it Enter Benvolio and Mercutio BENVOLIO Romeo My cousin Romeo Romeo MERCUTIO He is

the likeness of a sigh Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied Cry but Ah me Pronounce but Love and dove Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word One nickname for her purblind son and heir Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lovd the beggarmaid He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not The ape is dead and I must conjure him I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes By her high forehead and her scarlet lip By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh And the demesnes that there adjacent lie That in thy likeness thou appear to us BENVOLIO An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him MERCUTIO This cannot anger him Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress circle Of some strange nature letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjurd it down That were some spite My invocation Is fair and honest and in his mistress name I conjure only but to raise up him BENVOLIO Come he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night Blind is his love and best befits the dark MERCUTIO If love be blind love cannot hit the mark Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone O Romeo that she were O that she were An openarse and thou a poperin pear Romeo good night Ill to my trucklebed This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep Come shall we go BENVOLIO Go then for tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found Exeunt SCENE II Capulets Garden Enter Romeo ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound Juliet appears above at a window But soft what light through yonder window breaks It is the east and Juliet is the sun Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she Be not her maid since she is envious Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it cast it off It is my lady O it is my love O that she knew she were She speaks yet she says nothing What of that Her eye discourses I will answer it I am too bold tis not to me she speaks Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return What if her eyes were there they in her head The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night See how she leans her cheek upon her hand O that I were a glove upon that handThat I might touch that cheek JULIET Ay me ROMEO She speaks O speak again bright angel for thou art As glorious to this night being oer my head As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazypuffing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air JULIET O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo Deny thy father and refuse thy name Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love And Ill no longer be a Capulet ROMEO Aside Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this JULIET Tis but thy name that is my enemy Thou art thyself though not a Montague Whats Montague It is nor hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man O be some other name Whats in a name That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title Romeo doff thy name And for thy name which is no part of thee Take all myself ROMEO I take thee at thy word Call me but love and Ill be new baptisd Henceforth I never will be Romeo JULIET What man art thou that thus bescreend in night So stumblest on my counsel ROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am My name dear saint is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee Had I it written I would tear the word JULIET My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words Of thy tongues utterance yet I know the sound Art thou not Romeo and a Montague ROMEO Neither fair maid if either thee dislike JULIET How camst thou hither tell me and wherefore The orchard walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art If any of my kinsmen find thee here ROMEO With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls For stony limits cannot hold love out And what love can do that dares love attempt Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me JULIET If they do see thee they will murder thee ROMEO Alack there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet And I am proof against their enmity JULIET I would not for the world they saw thee here ROMEO I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes And but thou love me let them find me here My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued wanting of thy love JULIET By whose direction foundst thou out this place ROMEO By love that first did prompt me to enquire He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes I am no pilot yet wert thou as far As that vast shore washd with the farthest sea I should adventure for such merchandise JULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny What I have spoke but farewell compliment Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay And I will take thy word Yet if thou swearst Thou mayst prove false At lovers perjuries They say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won Ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay So thou wilt woo But else not for the world In truth fair Montague I am too fond And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light But trust me gentleman Ill prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange I should have been more strange I must confess But that thou overheardst ere I was ware My truelove passion therefore pardon me And not impute this yielding to light love Which the dark night hath so discovered ROMEO Lady by yonder blessed moon I vow That tips with silver all these fruittree tops JULIET O swear not by the moon thinconstant moon That monthly changes in her circled orb Lest that thy love prove likewise variable ROMEO What shall I swear by JULIET Do not swear at all Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self Which is the god of my idolatry And Ill believe thee ROMEO If my hearts dear love JULIET Well do not swear Although I joy in thee I have no joy of this contract tonight It is too rash too unadvisd too sudden Too like the lightning which doth cease to be Ere one can say It lightens Sweet good night This bud of love by summers ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet Good night good night As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast ROMEO O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied JULIET What satisfaction canst thou have tonight ROMEO Thexchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine JULIET I gave thee mine before thou didst request it And yet I would it were to give again ROMEO Wouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose love JULIET But to be frank and give it thee again And yet I wish but for the thing I have My bounty is as boundless as the sea My love as deep the more I give to thee The more I have for both are infinite I hear some noise within Dear love adieu Nurse calls within Anon good NurseSweet Montague be true Stay but a little I will come again Exit ROMEO O blessed blessed night I am afeard Being in night all this is but a dream Too flattering sweet to be substantial Enter Juliet above JULIET Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed If that thy bent of love be honourable Thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow By one that Ill procure to come to thee Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world NURSE Within Madam JULIET I come anon But if thou meanest not well I do beseech thee NURSE Within Madam JULIET By and by I come To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief Tomorrow will I send ROMEO So thrive my soul JULIET A thousand times good night Exit ROMEO A thousand times the worse to want thy light Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books But love from love towards school with heavy looks Retiring slowly Reenter Juliet above JULIET Hist Romeo hist O for a falconers voice To lure this tasselgentle back again Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of my Romeos name ROMEO It is my soul that calls upon my name How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night Like softest music to attending ears JULIET Romeo ROMEO My nyas JULIET What oclock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ROMEO By the hour of nine JULIET I will not fail Tis twenty years till then I have forgot why I did call thee back ROMEO Let me stand here till thou remember it JULIET I shall forget to have thee still stand there Remembering how I love thy company ROMEO And Ill still stay to have thee still forget Forgetting any other home but this JULIET Tis almost morning I would have thee gone And yet no farther than a wantons bird That lets it hop a little from her hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves And with a silk thread plucks it back again So lovingjealous of his liberty ROMEO I would I were thy bird JULIET Sweet so would I Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing Good night good night Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow Exit ROMEO Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest Hence will I to my ghostly Sires cell His help to crave and my dear hap to tell Exit SCENE III Friar Lawrences Cell Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket FRIAR LAWRENCE The greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth days pathway made by Titans fiery wheels Now ere the sun advance his burning eye The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers The earth thats natures mother is her tomb What is her burying grave that is her womb And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find Many for many virtues excellent None but for some and yet all different O mickle is the powerful grace that lies In plants herbs stones and their true qualities For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give Nor aught so good but straind from that fair use Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied And vice sometimes by action dignified Enter Romeo Within the infant rind of this weak flower Poison hath residence and medicine power For this being smelt with that part cheers each part Being tasted slays all senses with the heart Two such opposed kings encamp them still In man as well as herbsgrace and rude will And where the worser is predominant Full soon the canker death eats up that plant ROMEO Good morrow father FRIAR LAWRENCE Benedicite What early tongue so sweet saluteth me Young son it argues a distemperd head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye And where care lodges sleep will never lie But where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uprousd with some distemperature Or if not so then here I hit it right Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight ROMEO That last is true the sweeter rest was mine FRIAR LAWRENCE God pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline ROMEO With Rosaline my ghostly father No I have forgot that name and that names woe FRIAR LAWRENCE Thats my good son But where hast thou been then ROMEO Ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again I have been feasting with mine enemy Where on a sudden one hath wounded me Thats by me wounded Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies I bear no hatred blessed man for lo My intercession likewise steads my foe FRIAR LAWRENCE Be plain good son and homely in thy drift Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift ROMEO Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet As mine on hers so hers is set on mine And all combind save what thou must combine By holy marriage When and where and how We met we wood and made exchange of vow Ill tell thee as we pass but this I pray That thou consent to marry us today FRIAR LAWRENCE Holy Saint Francis What a change is here Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear So soon forsaken Young mens love then lies Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes Jesu Maria what a deal of brine Hath washd thy sallow cheeks for RosalineHow much salt water thrown away in waste To season love that of it doth not taste The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washd off yet If ere thou wast thyself and these woes thine Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline And art thou changd Pronounce this sentence then Women may fall when theres no strength in men ROMEO Thou chiddst me oft for loving Rosaline FRIAR LAWRENCE For doting not for loving pupil mine ROMEO And badst me bury love FRIAR LAWRENCE Not in a grave To lay one in another out to have ROMEO I pray thee chide me not her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow The other did not so FRIAR LAWRENCE O she knew well Thy love did read by rote that could not spell But come young waverer come go with me In one respect Ill thy assistant be For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households rancour to pure love ROMEO O let us hence I stand on sudden haste FRIAR LAWRENCE Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast Exeunt SCENE IV A Street Enter Benvolio and Mercutio MERCUTIO Where the devil should this Romeo be Came he not home tonight BENVOLIO Not to his fathers I spoke with his man MERCUTIO Why that same pale hardhearted wench that Rosaline torments him so that he will sure run mad BENVOLIO Tybalt"

outward wall Even in the force and road of casualty I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes Why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse Tell me once more what title thou dost bear Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves And well said too for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honourable Without the stamp of merit Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity O that estates degrees and offices Were not derivd corruptly and that clear honour Were purchasd by the merit of the wearer How many then should cover that stand bare How many be commanded that command How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honour And how much honour Pickd from the chaff and ruin of the

two Before you hazard for in choosing wrong I lose your company therefore forbear a while Theres something tells me but it is not love I would not lose you and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality But lest you should not understand me well And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me I could teach you How to choose right but then I am forsworn So will I never be So may you miss me But if you do youll make me wish a sin That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes They have oerlookd me and divided me One half of me is yours the other half yours Mine own I would say but if mine then yours And so all yours O these naughty times Puts bars between the owners and their rights And so though yours not yours Prove it so Let Fortune go to hell for it not I I speak too long but tis to peise the time To eche it and to draw it out in length To stay you from election BASSANIO Let me choose For as I am I live upon the rack PORTIA Upon the rack Bassanio Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love BASSANIO None but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear th enjoying of my love There may as well be amity and life Tween snow and fire as treason and my love PORTIA Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything BASSANIO Promise me life and Ill confess the truth PORTIA Well then confess and live BASSANIO Confess and love Had been the very sum of my confession O happy torment when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance But let me to my fortune and the caskets PORTIA Away then I am lockd in one of them If you do love me you will find me out Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof Let music sound while he doth make his choice Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end Fading in music That the comparison May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream And watry deathbed for him He may win And what is music then Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a newcrowned monarch Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear And summon him to marriage Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the seamonster I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th exploit Go Hercules Live thou I live With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makst the fray A song whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself Tell me where is fancy bred Or in the heart or in the head How begot how nourished Reply reply It is engendred in the eyes With gazing fed and fancy dies In the cradle where it lies Let us all ring fancys knell Ill begin itDing dong bell ALL Ding dong bell BASSANIO So may the outward shows be least themselves The world is still deceivd with ornament In law what plea so tainted and corrupt But being seasond with a gracious voice Obscures the show of evil In religion What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who inward searchd have livers white as milk And these assume but valours excrement To render them redoubted Look on beauty And you shall see tis purchasd by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature Making them lightest that wear most of it So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness often known To be the dowry of a second head The skull that bred them in the sepulchre Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold Hard food for Midas I will none of thee Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead Which rather threatenst than dost promise aught Thy palenness moves me more than eloquenceAnd here choose I joy be the consequence PORTIA Aside How all the other passions fleet to air As doubtful thoughts and rashembracd despair And shuddring fear and greeneyd jealousy O love be moderate allay thy ecstasy In measure rain thy joy scant this excess I feel too much thy blessing make it less For fear I surfeit BASSANIO What find I here Opening the leaden casket Fair Portias counterfeit What demigod Hath come so near creation Move these eyes Or whether riding on the balls of mine Seem they in motion Here are severd lips Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh tentrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs But her eyes How could he see to do them Having made one Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnishd Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance Heres the scroll The continent and summary of my fortune You that choose not by the view Chance as fair and choose as true Since this fortune falls to you Be content and seek no new If you be well pleasd with this And hold your fortune for your bliss Turn to where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave Kissing her I come by note to give and to receive Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes Hearing applause and universal shout Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no So thricefair lady stand I even so As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmd signd ratified by you PORTIA You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand Such as I am though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself A thousand times more fair ten thousand times More rich That only to stand high in your account I might in virtues beauties livings friends Exceed account But the full sum of me Is sum of something which to term in gross Is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractisd Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion master of my servants Queen oer myself and even now but now This house these servants and this same myself Are yoursmy lords I give them with this ring Which when you part from lose or give away Let it presage the ruin of your love And be my vantage to exclaim on you BASSANIO Madam you have bereft me of all words Only my blood speaks to you in my veins And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude Where every something being blent together Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy Expressd and not expressd But when this ring Parts from this finger then parts life from hence O then be bold to say Bassanios dead NERISSA My lord and lady it is now our time That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper To cry good joy Good joy my lord and lady GRATIANO My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish For I am sure you can wish none from me And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too BASSANIO With all my heart so thou canst get a wife GRATIANO I thank your lordship you have got me one My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours You saw the mistress I beheld the maid You lovd I lovd for intermission No more pertains to me my lord than you Your fortune stood upon the caskets there And so did mine too as the matter falls For wooing here until I sweat again And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love at last if promise last I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love provided that your fortune Achievd her mistress PORTIA Is this true Nerissa NERISSA Madam it is so you stand pleasd withal BASSANIO And do you Gratiano mean good faith GRATIANO Yes faith my lord BASSANIO Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage GRATIANO Well play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats NERISSA What

Salerio Whats the news from Venice How doth that royal merchant good Antonio I know he will be glad of our success We are the Jasons we have won the fleece SALERIO I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost PORTIA There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the colour from Bassanios cheek Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man What worse and worse With leave Bassanio I am half yourself And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you BASSANIO O sweet Portia Here are a few of the unpleasantst words That ever blotted paper Gentle lady When I did first impart my love to you I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins I was a gentleman And then I told you true And yet dear lady Rating myself at nothing you shall see How much I was a braggart When I told you My state was nothing I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing for indeed I have engagd myself to a dear friend Engagd my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means Here is a letter lady The paper as the body of my friend And every word in it a gaping wound Issuing lifeblood But is it true Salerio Hath all his ventures faild What not one hit From Tripolis from Mexico and England From Lisbon Barbary and India And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch Of merchantmarring rocks SALERIO Not one my lord Besides it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew He would not take it Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man He plies the Duke at morning and at night And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice Twenty merchants The Duke himself and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture of justice and his bond JESSICA When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonios flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him And I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor Antonio PORTIA Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble BASSANIO The dearest friend to me the kindest man The best conditiond and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy PORTIA What sum owes he the Jew BASSANIO For me three thousand ducats PORTIA What no more Pay him six thousand and deface the bond Double six thousand and then treble that Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanios fault First go with me to church and call me wife And then away to Venice to your friend For never

live as maids and widows Come away For you shall hence upon your wedding day Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer Since you are dear bought I will love you dear But let me hear the letter of your friend BASSANIO Sweet Bassanio my ships have all miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I should live all

hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a should be thought a coward But his few bad words are matchd with as few good deeds for a never broke any mans head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk They will steal anything and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lutecase bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three halfpence Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a fireshovel I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals They would have me as familiar with mens pockets as

soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power He is notGod be praised and blessedany hurt in the world but keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline There is an anchient lieutenant there at the pridge I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is a man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as gallant service GOWER What do you call him FLUELLEN He is calld Anchient Pistol GOWER I know him not Enter Pistol FLUELLEN Here is the man PISTOL Captain I thee beseech to do me favours The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well FLUELLEN Ay I praise God and I have merited some love at his hands PISTOL Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate And giddy Fortunes furious fickle wheel That goddess blind That stands upon the rolling restless stone FLUELLEN By your patience Anchient Pistol Fortune is painted blind with a muffler afore his eyes to signify to you that Fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls In good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it Fortune is an excellent moral PISTOL Fortune is Bardolphs foe and frowns on him For he hath stolen a pax and hanged must a be A damned death Let gallows gape for dog let man go free And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate But Exeter hath given the doom of death For pax of little price Therefore go speak the Duke will hear thy voice And let not Bardolphs vital thread be cut With edge of penny cord and vile reproach Speak captain for his life and I will thee requite FLUELLEN

very well what he has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is serve GOWER Why t is a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgracd what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what a beard of the generals cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and alewashd wits is wonderful to be thought on But you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistook FLUELLEN I tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is If I find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind Drum heard Hark

lost Fluellen FLUELLEN The perdition of the athversary hath been very great reasonable great Marry for my part I think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one Bardolph if your Majesty know the man His face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fires out KING HENRY We would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing

to Harry of England Though we seemd dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness Tell him we could have rebukd him at Harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to reanswer his pettishness would bow under For our losses his exchequer is too poor for the effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction To this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronouncd So far my King and master so much my office KING HENRY What is thy name I know thy quality MONTJOY Montjoy KING HENRY Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back And tell thy King I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment for to say the sooth Though tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage My people are with sickness much enfeebled My numbers lessend and those few I have Almost no better than so many French Who when they were in health I tell thee herald I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God That I do brag thus This your air of France Hath blown that vice in me I must repent Go therefore tell thy master here I am My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk My army but a weak and sickly guard Yet God before tell him we will come on Though France himself and such another neighbour Stand in our way Theres for thy labour Montjoy Go bid thy master well advise himself If we may pass we will if we be hindred We shall your tawny ground with your red blood Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well The sum of all our answer is but this We would not seek a battle as we are Nor as we are we say we will not shun it So tell your master MONTJOY I shall deliver so Thanks to your Highness Exit

Lord High Constable you talk of horse and armour ORLEANS You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world DAUPHIN What a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns Chha He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus qui a les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes ORLEANS Hes of the colour of the nutmeg DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus He is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him He is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts CONSTABLE Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage ORLEANS No more cousin DAUPHIN Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereigns sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus Wonder of nature ORLEANS I have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistress DAUPHIN Then did they imitate that which I composd to my courser for my horse is my mistress ORLEANS Your mistress bears well DAUPHIN Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress CONSTABLE Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back DAUPHIN So perhaps did yours CONSTABLE Mine was not bridled DAUPHIN O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait strossers CONSTABLE You have good judgment in horsemanship DAUPHIN Be warnd by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my mistress CONSTABLE I had as lief have my mistress a jade DAUPHIN I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hairCONSTABLE I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress DAUPHIN Le chien est retourn son propre vomissement et la truie lave au bourbier Thou makst use of anything CONSTABLE Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose RAMBURES My Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent tonight are those stars or suns upon it CONSTABLE Stars my lord DAUPHIN Some of them will fall tomorrow I hope CONSTABLE And yet my sky shall not want DAUPHIN That may be for you bear a many superfluously and twere more honour some were away CONSTABLE Even as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted DAUPHIN Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English faces CONSTABLE I will not say so for fear I should be facd out of my way But I would it were morning for I would fain be about the ears of the English RAMBURES Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners CONSTABLE You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them DAUPHIN Tis midnight Ill go arm myself Exit ORLEANS The Dauphin longs for morning RAMBURES He longs to eat the English CONSTABLE I

France CONSTABLE Doing is activity and he will still be doing ORLEANS He never did harm that I heard of CONSTABLE Nor will do none tomorrow He will keep that good name still ORLEANS I know him to be valiant CONSTABLE I was told that by one that knows him better than you ORLEANS Whats he CONSTABLE Marry he told me so himself and he said he card not who knew it ORLEANS He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him CONSTABLE By my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but his lackey Tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate ORLEANS Ill will never said well CONSTABLE I will cap that proverb with There is flattery in friendship ORLEANS And I will take up that with Give the devil his due CONSTABLE Well placd There stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with A pox of the devil ORLEANS You are the better at proverbs by how much A fools bolt is soon shot CONSTABLE You have shot over ORLEANS Tis not the first time you were overshot Enter a Messenger MESSENGER My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents CONSTABLE Who hath measurd the ground MESSENGER The Lord Grandpr CONSTABLE A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we do ORLEANS What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England to mope with his fatbraind followers so far out of his knowledge CONSTABLE If the English had any apprehension they would run away ORLEANS That they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces RAMBURES That island of England breeds very valiant creatures Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage ORLEANS Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushd like rotten apples You may as well say thats a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion CONSTABLE Just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils ORLEANS Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef CONSTABLE Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we about it ORLEANS It is now two oclock but let me see by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen Exeunt ACT IV Enter Chorus CHORUS Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe From camp to camp through the foul womb of night The hum of either army stilly sounds That the fixd sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each others watch Fire answers fire and through their paly flames Each battle sees the others umberd face Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs Piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents The armourers accomplishing the knights With busy hammers closing rivets up Give dreadful note of preparation The country cocks do crow the clocks do toll And the third hour of drowsy morning name Proud of their numbers and secure in soul The confident and overlusty French Do the lowrated English play at dice And chide the cripple tardygaited Night Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp So tediously away The poor condemned English Like sacrifices by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The mornings danger and their gesture sad Investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats Presented them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold The royal captain of this ruind band Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent Let him cry Praise and glory on his head For forth he goes and visits all his host Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers friends and countrymen Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour Unto the weary and allwatched night But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty That every wretch pining and pale before Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks A largess universal like the sun His liberal eye doth give to everyone Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all Behold as may unworthiness define A little touch of Harry in the night And so our scene must to the battle fly WhereO for pitywe shall much disgrace With four or five most vile and ragged foils Right illdisposd in brawl ridiculous The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see Minding true things by what their mockries be Exit SCENE I The English camp at Agincourt Enter King Henry Bedford and Gloucester KING HENRY Gloucester tis true that we are in great danger The greater therefore should our courage be Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty There is some soul of goodness in things evil Would men observingly distil it out For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers Which is both healthful and good husbandry Besides they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself Enter Erpingham Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France ERPINGHAM Not so my liege this lodging likes me better Since I"

Do summon us to part and bid good night Now let me say good night and so say you If you will say so you shall have a kiss 536 Good night quoth she and ere he says adieu The honey fee of parting tenderd is Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace Incorporate then they seem face grows to face 540 Till breathless he disjoind and backward drew The heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew Whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth 544 He with her plenty pressd she faint with dearth Their lips together glued fall to the earth Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey And gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth 548 Her lips are conquerors his lips obey Paying what ransom the insulter willeth Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high That she will draw his lips rich treasure dry 552 And having felt the sweetness of the spoil With blindfold fury she begins to forage Her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil And

Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover What though the rose have prickles yet tis pluckd Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last For pity now

butcher bent to kill On his bowback he hath a battle setOf bristly pikes that ever threat his foes 620 His eyes like glowworms shine when he doth fret His snout digs sepulchres whereer he goes Being movd he strikes whateer is in his way And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay 624 His brawny sides with hairy bristles armed Are better proof than thy spears point can enter His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed Being ireful on the lion he will venture 628 The thorny brambles and embracing bushes As fearful of him part through whom he rushes Alas he naught esteems that face of thine To which loves eyes pay tributary gazes 632 Nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne Whose full perfection all the world amazes But having thee at vantage wondrous dread Would root these beauties as he roots the mead Oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still 637 Beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends Come not within his danger by thy will They that thrive well take counsel of their

I not faint and fell I not downright Within my bosom whereon thou dost lie My boding heart pants beats and takes no rest But like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast For where love reigns

at my heart and whispers in mine ear That if I love thee I thy death should fear 660 And more than so presenteth to mine eye The picture of an angry chafing boar Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie An image like thyself all staind with gore 664 Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head What should I do seeing thee so indeed That tremble at thimagination 668 The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed And fear doth teach it divination I prophesy thy death my living sorrow If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow 672 But if thou needs wilt hunt be ruld by me Uncouple at the timorous flying hare Or at the fox which lives by subtilty Or at the roe which no encounter dare 676 Pursue these fearful creatures oer the downs And on thy wellbreathd horse keep with thy hounds And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare Mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles 680 How he outruns the wind and with what care He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles The many musits through the which he goes Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes 684 Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell And sometime where earthdelving conies keep To stop the loud pursuers in their yell 688 And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer Danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear For there his smell with others being mingled 691 The hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled With much ado the cold fault cleanly out Then do they spend their mouths echo replies As if another chase were in the skies 696 By this poor Wat far off upon a hill Stands on his hinder legs with listning ear To hearken if his foes pursue him still Anon their loud alarums he doth hear 700 And now his grief may be compared well To one sore sick that hears the passing bell Then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch Turn and return indenting with the way 704 Each envious briar his weary legs do scratch Each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay For misery is trodden on by many And being low never relievd by any 708 Lie quietly and hear a little more Nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise To make thee hate the hunting of the boar Unlike myself thou hearst me moralize 712 Applying this to that and so to so For love can comment upon every woe Where did I leave No matter where quoth he Leave me and then the story aptly ends 716 The night is spent Why what of that quoth she I am quoth he expected of my friends And now tis dark and going I shall fall In night quoth she desire sees best of all 720 But if thou fall oh then imagine this The earth in love with thee thy footing trips And all is but to rob thee of a kiss 723 Rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn Now of this dark night I perceive the reason Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine 728 Till forging nature be condemnd of treason For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine Wherein she framd thee in high heavens despite To shame the sun by day and her by night 732 And therefore hath she bribd the destinies To cross the curious workmanship of nature To mingle beauty with infirmities And pure perfection with impure defeature 736 Making it subject to the tyranny Of mad mischances and much misery As burning fevers agues pale and faint Lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood 740 The marroweating sickness whose attaint Disorder breeds by heating of the blood Surfeits imposthumes grief and damnd despair Swear natures death for framing thee so fair 744 And not the least of all these maladies But in one minutes fight brings beauty under Both favour savour hue and qualities Whereat thimpartial gazer late did wonder 748 Are on the sudden wasted thawd and done As mountain snow melts with the midday sun Therefore despite of fruitless chastity Lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns 752 That on the earth would breed a scarcity And barren dearth of daughters and of sons Be prodigal the lamp that burns by night Dries up his oil to lend the world his light 756 What is thy body but a swallowing grave Seeming to bury that posterity Which by the rights of time thou needs must have If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity 760 If so the world will hold thee in disdain Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain So in thyself thyself art made away A mischief worse than civil homebred strife 764 Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay Or butcher sire that reeves his son of life Foul cankring rust the hidden treasure frets But gold thats put to use more gold begets 768 Nay then quoth Adon you will fall again Into your idle overhandled theme The kiss I gave you is bestowd in vain And all in vain you strive against the stream 772 For by this blackfacd night desires foul nurse Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues And every tongue more moving than your own 776 Bewitching like the wanton mermaids songs Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown For know my heart stands armed in mine ear And will not let a false sound enter there 780 Lest the deceiving harmony should run Into the quiet closure of my breast And then my little heart were quite undone In his bedchamber to be barrd of rest 784 No lady no my heart longs not to groan But soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone What have you urgd that I cannot reprove The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger 790 I hate not love but your device in love That lends embracements unto every stranger You do it for increase O strange excuse When reason is the bawd to lusts abuse 792 Call it not love for love to heaven is fled Since sweating lust on earth usurpd his name Under whose simple semblance he hath fed Upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame 796 Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves As caterpillars do the tender leaves Love comforteth like sunshine after rain But lusts effect is tempest after sun 800 Loves gentle spring doth always fresh remain Lusts winter comes ere summer half be done Love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies Love is all truth lust full of forged lies 804 More I could tell but more I dare not say The text is old the orator too green Therefore in sadness now I will away My face is full of shame my heart of teen 808 Mine ears that to your wanton talk attended Do burn themselves for having so offended With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace 811 Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast And homeward through the dark laund runs apace Leaves love upon her back deeply distressd Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky So glides he in the night from Venus eye 816 Which after him she darts as one on shore Gazing upon a late embarked friend Till the wild waves will have him seen no more Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend 820 So did the merciless and pitchy night Fold in the object that did feed her sight Whereat amazd as one that unaware Hath droppd a precious jewel in the flood 824 Or stonishd as nightwanderers often are Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood Even so confounded in the dark she lay Having lost the fair discovery of her way 828 And now she beats her heart whereat it groans That all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled Make verbal repetition of her moans Passion on passion deeply is redoubled 832 Ay me she cries and twenty times Woe woe And twenty echoes twenty times cry so She marking them begins a wailing note And sings extemporally a woeful ditty 836 How love makes young men thrall and old men dote How love is wise in folly foolish witty Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe And still the choir of echoes answer so 840 Her song was tedious and outwore the night For lovers hours are long though seeming short If pleasd themselves others they think delight In such like circumstance with such like sport 844 Their copious stories oftentimes begun End without audience and are never done For who hath she to spend the night withal But idle sounds resembling parasites 848 Like shrilltongud tapsters answering every call Soothing the humour of fantastic wits She says Tis so they answer all Tis so And would say after her if she said No 852 Lo here the gentle lark weary of rest From his moist cabinet mounts up on high And wakes the morning from whose silver breast The sun ariseth in his majesty 856 Who doth the world so gloriously behold That cedar tops and hills seem burnishd goldVenus salutes him with this fair good morrow Oh thou clear god and patron of all light 860 From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow The beauteous influence that makes him bright There lives a son that suckd an earthly mother May lend thee light as thou dost lend to other This said she hasteth to a myrtle grove 865 Musing the morning is so much oerworn And yet she hears no tidings of her love She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn 868 Anon she hears them chant it lustily And all in haste she coasteth to the cry And as she runs the bushes in the way Some catch her by the neck some kiss her face 872 Some twine about her thigh to make her stay She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace Like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake 876 By this she hears the hounds are at a bay Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder Wreathd up in fatal folds just in his way The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder 880 Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds Appals her senses and her spirit confounds For now she knows it is no gentle chase But the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud 884 Because the cry remaineth in one place Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud Finding their enemy to be so curst They all strain courtsy who shall cope him first 888 This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear Through which it enters to surprise her heart Who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear With coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part 892 Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield They basely fly and dare not stay the field Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy Till cheering up her senses sore dismayd 896 She tells them tis a causeless fantasy And childish error that they are afraid Bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more And with that word she spied the hunted boar 900 Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red Like milk and blood being mingled both together A second fear through all her sinews spread Which madly hurries her she knows not whither 904 This way she runs and now she will no further But back retires to rate the boar for murther A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways She treads the path that she untreads again 908 Her more than haste is mated with delays Like the proceedings of a drunken brain Full of respects yet naught at all respecting In hand with all things naught at all effecting Here kenneld in a brake she finds a hound 913 And asks the weary caitiff for his master And there another licking of his wound Gainst venomd sores the only sovereign plaster 916 And here she meets another sadly scowling To whom she speaks and he replies with howling When he hath ceasd his illresounding noise Another flapmouthd mourner black and grim 920 Against the welkin volleys out his voice Another and another answer him Clapping their proud tails to the ground below Shaking their scratchd ears bleeding as they go Look how the worlds poor people are amazed 925 At apparitions signs and prodigies Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed Infusing them with dreadful prophecies 928 So she at these sad signs draws up her breath And sighing it again exclaims on death Hardfavourd tyrant ugly meagre lean 931 Hateful divorce of love thus chides she death Grimgrinning ghost earths worm what dost thou mean To stifle beauty and to steal his breath Who when he livd his breath and beauty set Gloss on the rose smell to the violet 936 If he be dead O no it cannot be Seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it O yes it may thou hast no eyes to see But hatefully at random dost thou hit 940 Thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infants heart Hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke And hearing him thy power had lost his power 944 The destinies will curse thee for this stroke They bid thee crop a weed thou pluckst a flower Loves golden arrow at him should have fled And not deaths ebon dart to strike him dead 948 Dost thou drink tears that thou provokst such weeping What may a heavy groan advantage thee Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see 952 Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour Since her best work is ruind with thy rigour Here overcome as one full of despair She vaild her eyelids who like sluices stoppd 956 The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair In the sweet channel of her bosom droppd But through the floodgates breaks the silver rain And with his strong course opens them again 960 O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow Her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye Both crystals where they viewd each others sorrow Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry 964 But like a stormy day now wind now rain Sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again Variable passions throng her constant woe As striving who should best become her grief 968 All entertaind each passion labours so That every present sorrow seemeth chief But none is best then join they all together Like many clouds consulting for foul weather 972 By this far off she hears some huntsman holla A nurses song neer pleasd her babe so well The dire imagination she did follow This sound of hope doth labour to expel 976 For now reviving joy bids her rejoice And flatters her it is Adonis voice Whereat her tears began to turn their tide Being prisond in her eye like pearls in glass 980 Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside Which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground Who is but drunken when she seemeth drownd O hardbelieving love how strange it seems 985 Not to believe and yet too credulous Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes Despair and hope make thee ridiculous 988 The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought Adonis lives and death is not to blame 992 It was not she that calld him all to naught Now she adds honours to his hateful name She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings Imperious supreme of all mortal things 996 No no quoth she sweet death I did but jest Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear Whenas I met the boar that bloody beast Which knows no pity but is still severe 1000 Then gentle shadowtruth I must confess I raild on thee fearing my loves decease Tis not my fault the boar provokd my tongue Be wreakd on him invisible commander 1004 Tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong I did but act hes author of my slander Grief hath two tongues and never woman yet Could rule them both without ten womens wit Thus hoping that Adonis is alive 1009 Her rash suspect she doth extenuate And that his beauty may the better thrive With death she humbly doth insinuate 1012 Tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories His victories his triumphs and his glories O love quoth she how much a fool was I To be of such a weak and silly mind 1016 To wail his death who lives and must not die Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind For he being dead with him is beauty slain And beauty dead black Chaos comes again 1020 Fie fie fond love thou art as full of fear As one with treasure laden hemmd with thieves Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves 1024 Even at this word she hears a merry horn Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn As falcon to the lure away she flies The grass stoops not she treads on it so light 1028 And in her haste unfortunately spies The foul boars conquest on her fair delight Which seen her eyes as murderd with the view Like stars ashamd of day themselves withdrew Or as the snail whose tender horns being hit 1033 Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain And there all smotherd up in shade doth sit Long after fearing to creep forth again 1036 So at his bloody view her eyes are fled Into the deep dark cabins of her head Where they resign their office and their light To the disposing of her troubled brain 1040 Who bids them still consort with ugly night And never wound the heart with looks again Who like a king perplexed in his throne By their suggestion gives a deadly groan 1044 Whereat each tributary subject quakes As when the wind imprisond in the ground Struggling for passage earths foundation shakes Which with cold terror doth mens minds confound This mutiny each part doth so surprise 1049 That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes And being opend threw unwilling light Upon the wide wound that the boar had trenchd In his soft flank whose wonted lily white 1053 With purple tears that his wound wept was drenchd No flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed But stole his blood and seemd with him to bleed This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth 1057 Over one shoulder doth she hang her head Dumbly she passions franticly she doteth She thinks he could not die he is not dead 1060 Her voice is stoppd her joints forget to bow Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three And then she reprehends her mangling eye 1065 That makes more gashes where no breach should be His face seems twain each several limb is doubled For oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled My tongue cannot express my grief for one 1069 And yet quoth she behold two Adons dead My sighs are blown away my salt tears gone Mine eyes are turnd to fire my heart to lead 1072 Heavy hearts lead melt at mine eyes red fire So shall I die by drops of hot desire Alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost What face remains alive thats worth the viewing Whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast Of things long since or anything ensuing 1078 The flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim But true sweet beauty livd and died with him Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear 1081 Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you Having no fair to lose you need not fear The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you But when Adonis livd sun and sharp air 1085 Lurkd like two thieves to rob him of his fair And therefore would he put his bonnet on Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep 1088 The wind would blow it off and being gone Play with his locks then would Adonis weepAnd straight in pity of his tender years They both would strive who first should dry his tears To see his face the lion walkd along 1093 Behind some hedge because he would not fear him To recreate himself when he hath sung The tiger would be tame and gently hear him 1096 If he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey And never fright the silly lamb that day When he beheld his shadow in the brook The fishes spread on it their golden gills 1100 When he was by the birds such pleasure took That some would sing some other in their bills Would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries He fed them with his sight they him with berries But this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar 1105 Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave Neer saw the beauteous livery that he wore Witness the entertainment that he gave 1108 If he did see his face why then I know He thought to kiss him and hath killd him so Tis true tis true thus was Adonis slain He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear 1112 Who did not whet his teeth at him again But by a kiss thought to persuade him there And nuzzling in his flank the loving swine Sheathd unaware the tusk in his soft groin 1116 Had I been toothd like him I must confess With kissing him I should have killd him first But he is dead and never did he bless My youth with his the more am I accurst 1120 With this she falleth in the place she stood And stains her face with his congealed blood She looks upon his lips and they are pale She takes him by the hand and that is cold 1124 She whispers in his ears a heavy tale As if they heard the woeful words she told She lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes Where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies Two glasses where herself herself beheld 1129 A thousand times and now no more reflect Their virtue lost wherein they late excelld And every beauty robbd of his effect 1132 Wonder of time quoth she this is my spite That thou being dead the day should yet be light Since thou art dead lo here I prophesy Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend 1136 It shall be waited on with jealousy Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end Neer settled equally but high or low That all loves pleasure shall not match his woe It shall be fickle false and full of fraud 1141 Bud and be blasted in a breathing while The bottom poison and the top oerstrawd With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile 1144 The strongest body shall it make most weak Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak It shall be sparing and too full of riot Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures 1148 The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet Pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures It shall be raging mad and silly mild Make the young old the old become a child 1152 It shall suspect where is no cause of fear It shall not fear where it should most mistrust It shall be merciful and too severe And most deceiving when it seems most just 1156 Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward Put fear to valour courage to the coward It shall be cause of war and dire events And set dissension twixt the son and sire 1160 Subject and servile to all discontents As dry combustious matter is to fire Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy They that love best their love shall not enjoy 1164 By this the boy that by her side lay killd Was melted like a vapour from her sight And in his blood that on the ground lay spilld A purple flower sprung up chequerd with white 1168 Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood She bows her head the newsprung flower to smell Comparing it to her Adonis breath 1172 And says within her bosom it shall dwell Since he himself is reft from her by death She crops the stalk and in the breach appears Greendropping sap which she compares to tears Poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise Sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire For every little grief to wet his eyes To grow unto himself was his desire 1180 And so tis thine but know it is as good To wither in my breast as in his blood Here was thy fathers bed here in my breast Thou art the next of blood and tis thy right 1184 Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night There shall not be one minute in an hour Wherein I will not kiss my sweet loves flower Thus weary of the world away she hies 1189 And yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid Their mistress mounted through the empty skies In her light chariot quickly is conveyd 1192 Holding their course to Paphos where their queen Means to immure herself and not be seenTHE SONNETS 1 From fairest creatures we desire increase That thereby beautys rose might never die But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel Making a famine where abundance lies Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud buriest thy content And tender churl makst waste in niggarding Pity the world or else this glutton be To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee 2 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now Will be a tattered weed of small worth held Then being asked where all thy beauty lies Where all the treasure of thy lusty days To say within thine own deep sunken eyes Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise How much more praise deservd thy beautys use If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse Proving his beauty by succession thine This were to be new made when thou art old And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold 3 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother For where is she so fair whose uneared womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry Or who is he so fond will be the tomb Of his selflove to stop posterity Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime So thou through windows of thine age shalt see Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time But if thou live remembered not to be Die single and thine image dies with thee 4 Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend Upon thyself thy beautys legacy Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend And being frank she lends to those are free Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give Profitless usurer why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live For having traffic with thyself alone Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive Then how when nature calls thee to be gone What acceptable audit canst thou leave Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee Which used lives th executor to be 5 Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel For neverresting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where Then were not summers distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass Beautys effect with beauty were bereft Nor it nor no remembrance what it was But flowers distilled though they with winter meet Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet 6 Then let not winters ragged hand deface In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled That use is not forbidden usury Which happies those that pay the willing loan Thats for thyself to breed another thee Or ten times happier be it ten for one Ten times thyself were happier than thou art If ten of thine ten times refigured thee Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart Leaving thee living in posterity Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir 7 Lo in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head each under eye Doth homage to his newappearing sight Serving with looks his sacred majesty And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill Resembling strong youth in his middle age Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still Attending on his golden pilgrimage But when from highmost pitch with weary car Like feeble age he reeleth from the day The eyes fore duteous now converted are From his low tract and look another way So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son 8 Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy If the true concord of welltuned sounds By unions married do offend thine ear They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear Mark how one string sweet husband to another Strikes each in each by mutual ordering Resembling sire and child and happy mother Who all in one one pleasing note do sing Whose speechless song being many seeming one Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none 9 Is it for fear to wet a widows eye That thou consumst thyself in single life Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die The world will wail thee like a makeless wife The world will be thy widow and still weep That thou no form of thee hast left behind When every private widow well may keep By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it But beautys waste hath in the world an end And kept unused the user so destroys it No love toward others in that bosom sits That on himself such murdrous shame commits 10 For shame deny that thou bearst love to any Who for thyself art so unprovident Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many But that thou none lovst is most evident For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate That gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire O change thy thought that I may change my mind Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love Be as thy presence is gracious and kind Or to thyself at least kindhearted prove Make thee another self for love of me That beauty still may live in thine or thee 11 As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst In one of thine from that which thou departest And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase Without this folly age and cold decay If all were minded so the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away Let those whom nature hath not made for store Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die 12 When I do count the clock that tells the time And see the brave day sunk in hideous night When I behold the violet past prime And sable curls all silvered oer with white When lofty trees I see barren of leaves Which erst from heat did canopy the herd And summers green all girded up in sheaves Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard Then of thy beauty do I question make That thou among the wastes of time must go Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake And die as fast as they see others grow And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence 13 O that you were your self but love you are No longer yours than you yourself here live"

bore heads so high they kissd the clouds And strangers neer beheld but wonderd at Whose men and dames so jetted and adornd Like one anothers glass to trim them by Their tables were stored full to glad the sight And not so much to feed on as delight All poverty was scornd and pride so great The name of help grew odious to repeat DIONYZA O tis too true CLEON But see what heaven can do By this our change These mouths who but of late earth sea and air Were all too little to content and please Although they gave their creatures in abundance As houses are defiled for want of use They are now starved for want of exercise Those palates who not yet two summers younger Must have inventions to delight the taste Would now be glad of bread and beg for it Those mothers who to nousle up their babes Thought nought too curious are ready now To eat those little darlings whom they loved So sharp are hungers teeth that man and wife Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping Here many sink yet those which see them fall Have scarce strength left to give them burial Is not this true DIONYZA Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it CLEON O let

power To beat us down the which are down already And make a conquest of unhappy me Whereas no glorys got to overcome LORD Thats the least fear for by the semblance Of their white flags displayd they bring us peace And come to us as favourers not as foes CLEON Thou speakst like hims untutord to repeat Who makes the fairest show means most deceit But bring they what they will and what they can What need we fear The grounds the lowest and we are half way there Go tell their general we attend him here To know for what he comes and whence he comes And what he craves LORD I go my lord Exit CLEON

impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell RODERIGO Adieu Exit IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evend with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash For his quick hunting stand the putting on Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank

She is indeed perfection IAGO Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of

this fellow that is gone before He is a soldier fit to stand by Csar And give direction and do but see his vice Tis to his virtue a just equinox The one as long as th other Tis pity of him I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island MONTANO But is he often thus IAGO Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep Hell watch the horologe a double set If

MONTANO Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death OTHELLO Hold for your lives IAGO Hold ho lieutenantsirMontanogentlemen Have you forgot all place of sense and duty Hold The general speaks to you hold hold for shame OTHELLO Why how now ho From whence ariseth this Are we turnd Turks and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety What is the matter masters Honest Iago that looks dead with grieving Speak who began this On thy love I charge thee IAGO I do not know Friends all but now even now In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed and then but now As if some planet had unwitted men Swords out and tilting one at others breast In opposition bloody I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it OTHELLO How comes it Michael you are thus forgot CASSIO I pray you pardon me I cannot speak OTHELLO Worthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure whats the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler Give me answer to it MONTANO Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger Your officer Iago can inform you While I spare speech which something now offends me Of all that I do know nor know I aught By me thats said or done amiss this night Unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us OTHELLO Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way Zounds if I stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approvd in this offence Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety Tis monstrous Iago who begant MONTANO If partially affind or leagud in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier IAGO Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determind sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamour as it so fell out The town might fall in fright he swift of foot Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I neer might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass OTHELLO I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine Enter Desdemona attended Look if my gentle love be not raisd up Ill make thee an example DESDEMONA Whats the matter OTHELLO Alls well now sweeting come away to bed Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon Lead him off Montano is led off Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted Come Desdemona tis the soldiers life To have their balmy slumbers wakd with strife Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio IAGO What are you hurt lieutenant CASSIO Ay past all surgery IAGO Marry Heaven forbid CASSIO Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation IAGO As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you CASSIO I know not IAGO Ist possible CASSIO I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains That we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beastsIAGO Why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself IAGO Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good CASSIO I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblessd and the ingredient is a devil IAGO Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love you CASSIO I have well approved it sirI drunk IAGO You or any man living may be drunk at a time man Ill tell you what you shall do Our generals wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her Importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before CASSIO You advise me well IAGO I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness CASSIO I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here IAGO You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch CASSIO Good night honest Iago Exit IAGO And whats he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit Shes framd as fruitful As the free elements And then for her To win the Moor weret to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetterd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now for whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor Ill pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her bodys lust And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all Enter Roderigo How now Roderigo RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice IAGO How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time Doest not go well Cassio hath beaten thee And thou by that small hurt hast cashierd Cassio Though other things grow fair against the sun Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe Content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee gone Exit Roderigo Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress Ill set her on Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife Ay thats the way Dull not device by coldness and delay Exit ACT III SCENE I Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Cassio and some Musicians CASSIO Masters play here I will content your pains Something thats brief and bid Good morrow general Music Enter Clown CLOWN Why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak i the nose thus FIRST MUSICIAN How sir how CLOWN Are these I pray you wind instruments FIRST MUSICIAN Ay marry are they sir CLOWN O thereby hangs a tail FIRST MUSICIAN Whereby hangs a tale sir CLOWN Marry sir by

your bag for Ill away Go vanish into air away Exeunt Musicians CASSIO Dost thou hear mine honest friend CLOWN No I hear not your honest friend I hear you CASSIO Prithee keep up thy quillets Theres a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring tell her theres one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech Wilt thou do this CLOWN She is stirring sir if she will stir hither I shall seem to notify unto her CASSIO Do good my friend Exit Clown Enter Iago In happy time Iago IAGO You have not been abed then CASSIO Why no The day had broke Before we parted I have made bold Iago To send in to your wife My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access IAGO Ill send her to you presently And Ill devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way that your converse and business May be more free CASSIO I humbly thank you fort Exit Iago I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest Enter Emilia EMILIA Good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again CASSIO Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone EMILIA Pray you come in I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely CASSIO I am much bound to you Exeunt SCENE II Cyprus A Room in the Castle Enter Othello Iago and Gentlemen OTHELLO These letters give Iago to the pilot And

your lordship Exeunt SCENE III Cyprus The Garden of the Castle Enter Desdemona Cassio and Emilia DESDEMONA Be thou assured good Cassio I will do All my abilities in thy behalf EMILIA Good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his DESDEMONA O thats an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were CASSIO Bounteous madam Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio Hes never anything but your true servant DESDEMONA I knowt I thank you You do love my lord You have known him long and be you well assurd He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distance CASSIO Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstance That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service DESDEMONA Do not doubt that Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee If I do vow a friendship Ill perform it To the last article My lord shall never rest Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift Ill intermingle everything he does With Cassios suit Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away Enter Othello and Iago EMILIA Madam here comes my lord CASSIO Madam Ill take my leave DESDEMONA Why stay and hear me speak CASSIO Madam not now I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes DESDEMONA Well do your discretion Exit Cassio IAGO Ha I like not that OTHELLO What dost thou say IAGO Nothing my lord or ifI know not what OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife IAGO Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike Seeing you coming OTHELLO I do believe twas he DESDEMONA How now my lord I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure OTHELLO Who ist you mean DESDEMONA Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back OTHELLO Went he hence now DESDEMONA Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him back OTHELLO Not now sweet Desdemon some other time DESDEMONA But shallt be shortly OTHELLO The sooner sweet for you DESDEMONA Shallt be tonight at supper OTHELLO No not tonight DESDEMONA Tomorrow dinner then OTHELLO I shall not dine at home I meet the captains at the citadel DESDEMONA Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn I prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith hes penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason Save that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath taen your part to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do much OTHELLO Prithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothingDESDEMONA Why this is not a boon Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this To leave me but a little to myself DESDEMONA Shall I deny you No farewell my lord OTHELLO Farewell my Desdemona Ill come to thee straight DESDEMONA Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you Whateer you be I am obedient Exit with Emilia OTHELLO Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee And when I love thee not Chaos is come again IAGO My noble lord OTHELLO What dost thou say Iago IAGO Did Michael Cassio when you wood my lady Know of your love OTHELLO He did from first to last Why dost thou ask IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought No further harm OTHELLO Why of thy thought Iago IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her OTHELLO O yes and went between us very oft IAGO Indeed OTHELLO Indeed Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that Is he not honest IAGO Honest my lord OTHELLO Honest ay honest IAGO My lord for aught I know OTHELLO What dost thou think IAGO Think my lord OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou likst not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me Show me thy thought IAGO My lord you know I love you OTHELLO I think thou dost And for I know thourt full of love and honesty And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just Theyre close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule IAGO For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest OTHELLO I think so too IAGO Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem IAGO Why then I think Cassios an honest man OTHELLO Nay yet theres more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words IAGO Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As wheres that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear A stranger to thy thoughts IAGO I do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my natures plague To spy into abuses and of my jealousy Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts OTHELLO What dost thou mean IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed OTHELLO By heaven Ill know thy thoughts IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody OTHELLO Ha IAGO O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he oer Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves OTHELLO O misery IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy OTHELLO Why why is this Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolvd exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abusd Look tot I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience Is not to leave undone but keep unknown OTHELLO Dost thou say so IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most OTHELLO And so she did IAGO Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever IAGO I see this hath a little dashd your spirits OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot IAGO Trust me I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see youre movd I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion OTHELLO I will not IAGO Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend My lord I see youre movd OTHELLO No not much movd I do not think but Desdemonas honest IAGO Long live she so And long live you to think so OTHELLO And yet how nature erring from itself IAGO Ay theres the point As to be bold with you Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh One may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent OTHELLO Farewell farewell If more thou dost perceive let me know more Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago IAGO Going My lord I take my leave OTHELLO Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds IAGO Returning My lord I would I might entreat your honour To scan this thing no further Leave it to time Though it be fit that Cassio have his place For sure he fills it up with great ability Yet if you please to hold him off awhile You shall by that perceive him and his means Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity Much will be seen in that In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears As worthy cause I have to fear I am And hold her free I do beseech your honour OTHELLO Fear not my government IAGO I once more take my leave Exit OTHELLO This fellows of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings Id whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune Haply for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have or for I"

Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back OTHELLO Went he hence now DESDEMONA Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him back OTHELLO Not now sweet Desdemon some other time DESDEMONA But shallt be shortly OTHELLO The sooner sweet for you DESDEMONA Shallt be tonight at supper OTHELLO No not tonight DESDEMONA Tomorrow dinner then OTHELLO I shall not dine at home I meet the captains at the citadel DESDEMONA Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn I prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith hes penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason Save that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath taen your part to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do much OTHELLO Prithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothingDESDEMONA Why this is not a boon Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this To leave me but a little to myself DESDEMONA Shall I deny you No farewell my lord OTHELLO Farewell my Desdemona Ill come to thee straight DESDEMONA Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you Whateer you be I am obedient Exit with Emilia OTHELLO Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee And when I love thee not Chaos is come again IAGO My noble lord OTHELLO What dost thou say Iago IAGO Did Michael Cassio when you wood my lady Know of your love OTHELLO He did from first to last Why dost thou ask IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought No further harm OTHELLO Why of thy thought Iago IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her OTHELLO O yes and went between us very oft IAGO Indeed OTHELLO Indeed Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that Is he not honest IAGO Honest my lord OTHELLO Honest ay honest IAGO My lord for aught I know OTHELLO What dost thou think IAGO Think my lord OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou likst not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me Show me thy thought IAGO My lord you know I love you OTHELLO I think thou dost And for I know thourt full of love and honesty And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just Theyre close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule IAGO For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest OTHELLO I think so too IAGO Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem IAGO Why then I think Cassios an honest man OTHELLO Nay yet theres more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words IAGO Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As wheres that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear A stranger to thy thoughts IAGO I do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my natures plague To spy into abuses and of my jealousy Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts OTHELLO What dost thou mean IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed OTHELLO By heaven Ill know thy thoughts IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody OTHELLO Ha IAGO O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he oer Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves OTHELLO O misery IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy OTHELLO Why why is this Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolvd exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abusd Look tot I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience Is not to leave undone but keep unknown OTHELLO Dost thou say so IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most OTHELLO And so she did IAGO Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever IAGO I see this hath a little dashd your spirits OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot IAGO Trust me I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see youre movd I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion OTHELLO I will not IAGO Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend My lord I see youre movd OTHELLO No not much movd I do not think but Desdemonas honest IAGO Long live she so And long live you to think so OTHELLO And yet how nature erring from itself IAGO Ay theres the point As to be bold with you Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh One may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent OTHELLO Farewell farewell If more thou dost perceive let me know more Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago IAGO Going My lord I take my leave OTHELLO Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds IAGO Returning My lord I would I might entreat your honour To scan this thing no further Leave it to time Though it be fit that Cassio have his place For sure he fills it up with great ability Yet if you please to hold him off awhile You shall by that perceive him and his means Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity Much will be seen in that In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears As worthy cause I have to fear I am And hold her free I do beseech your honour OTHELLO Fear not my government IAGO I once more take my leave Exit OTHELLO This fellows of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings Id whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune Haply for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have or for I am declind Into the vale of yearsyet thats not much Shes gone I am abusd and my relief Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapour of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others uses Yet tis the plague of great ones Prerogativd are they less than the base Tis destiny unshunnable like death Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken Desdemona comes If she be false O then heaven mocks itself Ill not believet Enter Desdemona and Emilia DESDEMONA How now my dear Othello Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presence OTHELLO I am to blame DESDEMONA Why do you speak

glad I have found this napkin This was her first remembrance from the Moor My wayward husband hath a hundred times Wood me to steal it But she so loves the token For he conjurd her she should ever keep it That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to Ill have the work taen out And givet Iago What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy Enter Iago IAGO How now What do you here alone EMILIA Do not you chide I have a thing for you IAGO A thing for me It is a common thing EMILIA Ha IAGO To have a foolish wife EMILIA O is that all What will you give me now For that same handkerchief IAGO What handkerchief EMILIA What handkerchief Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me steal IAGO Hast stoln it from her EMILIA No faith she let it drop by negligence And to the advantage I being here took t up Look here it is IAGO A good wench give it me EMILIA What will you do witht that you have been so earnestTo have me filch it IAGO Snatching it Why whats that to you EMILIA If it be not for some purpose of import Give t me again Poor lady shell run mad When she shall lack it IAGO Be not acknown ont I have use for it Go leave me Exit Emilia I will in Cassios lodging lose this napkin And let him find it Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ This may do something The Moor already changes with my poison Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so Enter Othello Look where he comes Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owdst yesterday OTHELLO Ha ha false to me IAGO Why how now general No more of that OTHELLO Avaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack I swear tis better to be much abusd Than but to knowt a little IAGO How now my

robbd not wanting what is stoln Let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all IAGO I am sorry to hear this OTHELLO I had been happy if the general camp Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body So I had nothing known O now for ever Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars That make ambition virtue O farewell Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war And O you mortal engines whose rude throats The immortal Joves dread clamours counterfeit Farewell Othellos occupations gone IAGO Ist possible my lord OTHELLO Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof Or by the worth of mans eternal soul Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my wakd wrath IAGO Ist come to this OTHELLO Make me to seet or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life IAGO My noble lord OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me Never pray more Abandon all remorse On horrors head horrors accumulate Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazd For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that IAGO O grace O heaven defend me Are you a man Have you a soul or sense God be wi you Take mine officeO wretched fool That livst to make thine honesty a vice O monstrous world Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe I thank you for this profit and from hence Ill love no friend sith love

think that thou art just and think thou art not Ill have some proof her name that was as fresh As Dians visage is now begrimd and black As mine own face If there be cords or knives Poison or fire or suffocating streams Ill not endure t Would I were satisfied IAGO I see sir you are eaten up with passion I do repent me that I put it to you You would be satisfied OTHELLO Would Nay I will IAGO And may but how How satisfied my lord Would you the supervisor grossly gape on Behold her toppd OTHELLO Death and damnation O IAGO It were a tedious difficulty I think To bring them to that prospect Damn

monkeys As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk But yet I say If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may havet OTHELLO Give me a living reason shes disloyal IAGO I do not like the office But sith I am enterd in this cause so far Prickd to t by foolish honesty and love I will go on I lay with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep There are a kind of men so loose of soul That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs One of this kind is Cassio In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona Let us be wary let us hide our loves And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard As if he pluckd up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips then laid his leg Over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then Cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor OTHELLO O monstrous monstrous IAGO Nay this was but his dream OTHELLO But this denoted a foregone conclusion Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream IAGO And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly OTHELLO Ill tear her all to pieces IAGO Nay but be wise Yet we see nothing done She may be honest yet Tell me but this Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand OTHELLO I gave her such a one twas my first gift IAGO I know not that but such a handkerchief I am sure it was your wifes did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with OTHELLO If it be that IAGO If it be that or any that was hers It speaks against her with the other proofs OTHELLO O that the slave had forty thousand lives One is too poor too weak for my revenge Now do I see tis true Look here Iago All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven Tis gone Arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught For tis of aspics tongues IAGO Yet be content OTHELLO O blood Iago blood IAGO Patience I say Your mind perhaps may change OTHELLO Never Iago Like to the Pontic Sea Whose icy current and compulsive course Neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven In the due reverence of a sacred vow Kneels I here engage my words IAGO Do not rise yet Kneels Witness you everburning lights above You elements that clip us round about Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit hands heart To wrongd Othellos service Let him command And to obey shall be in me remorse What bloody business ever They rise OTHELLO I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous And will upon the instant put thee to t Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassios not alive IAGO My friend is dead Tis done at your request But let her live OTHELLO Damn her lewd minx O damn her damn her Come go with me apart I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant IAGO I am your own for ever Exeunt SCENE IV Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Desdemona Emilia and Clown DESDEMONA Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies CLOWN I dare not say he lies anywhere DESDEMONA Why man CLOWN Hes a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing DESDEMONA Go to Where lodges he CLOWN To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie DESDEMONA Can anything be made of this CLOWN I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat DESDEMONA Can you inquire him out and be edified by report CLOWN I will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer DESDEMONA Seek him bid him come hither Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well CLOWN To do this is within the compass of mans wit and therefore I will attempt the doing it Exit DESDEMONA Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia EMILIA I know not madam DESDEMONA Believe me I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are it were enough To put him to ill thinking EMILIA Is he not jealous DESDEMONA Who he I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humours from him EMILIA Look where he comes Enter Othello DESDEMONA I will not leave him now till Cassio Be calld to him How

felt no age nor known no sorrow OTHELLO This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart Hot hot and moist This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer Much castigation exercise devout For heres a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels Tis a good hand A frank one DESDEMONA You may indeed say so For twas that hand that gave away my heart OTHELLO A liberal hand The hearts of old gave hands But our new heraldry is hands not hearts DESDEMONA I cannot speak of this Come now your promise OTHELLO What promise chuck DESDEMONA I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you OTHELLO I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me Lend me thy handkerchief DESDEMONA Here my lord OTHELLO That which I gave you DESDEMONA I have it not about me OTHELLO Not DESDEMONA No faith my lord OTHELLO That is a fault That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give She was a charmer and could almost read The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love But if she lost it Or made a gift of it my fathers eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies she dying gave it me And bid me when my fate would have me wive To give it her I did so and take heed ont Make it a darling like your precious eye To loset or givet away were such perdition As nothing else could match DESDEMONA Ist possible OTHELLO Tis true Theres magic in the web of it A sibyl that had numberd in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses In her prophetic fury sewd the work The worms were hallowd that did breed the silk And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conservd of maidens hearts DESDEMONA Indeed Ist true OTHELLO Most veritable therefore look to t well DESDEMONA Then would to God that I

of his love Whom I with all the office of my heart Entirely honour I would not be delayd If my offence be of such mortal kind That nor my service past nor present sorrows Nor purposd merit in futurity Can ransom me into his love again But to know so must be my benefit So shall I clothe me in a forcd content And shut myself up in some other course To fortunes alms DESDEMONA Alas thricegentle Cassio My advocation is not now in tune My lord is not my lord nor should I know him Were he in favour as in humour alterd So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech You must awhile be patient What I can do I will and more I will Than for myself I dare Let that suffice you IAGO Is my lord angry EMILIA He went hence but now And certainly in strange unquietness IAGO Can he be angry I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air And like the devil from his very arm Puffd his own brother and can he be angry Something of moment then I will go meet him Theres matter int indeed if he be angry DESDEMONA I prithee do so Exit Iago Something sure of state Either from Venice or some unhatchd practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases Mens natures wrangle with inferior things Though great ones are their object Tis even so For let our finger ache and it indues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain Nay we must think men are not gods Nor of them look for such observancy As fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia I was unhandsome warrior as I am Arraigning his unkindness with my soul But now I find I had subornd the witness And hes indicted falsely EMILIA Pray heaven it be state matters as you think And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you DESDEMONA Alas the day I never gave him cause EMILIA But jealous souls will not be answerd so They are not ever jealous for the cause But jealous for they are jealous tis a monster Begot upon itself born on itself DESDEMONA Heaven keep that monster from Othellos mind EMILIA Lady amen DESDEMONA I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout If I do find him

lord and being hers She may I think bestowt on any man OTHELLO She is protectress of her honour too May she give that IAGO Her honour is an essence thats not seen They have it very oft that have it

And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns That dwell in every region of his face For I will make him tell the tale anew Where how how oft how long ago and when He hath and is again to cope your

and performed it too Now when the lords and barons of the realm Perceived Northumberland did lean to him The more and less came in with cap and knee Met him in boroughs cities villages Attended him on bridges stood in lanes Laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths Give him their heirs as pages followd him Even at the heels in golden multitudes He presently as greatness knows itself Steps me a little higher than his vow Made to my father while his blood was poor Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh And now forsooth takes on him to reform Some certain edicts and some strait decrees That lie too heavy on the commonwealth Cries out upon abuses seems to weep Over his countrys wrongs and by this face This seeming brow of justice did he win The hearts of all that he did angle for Proceeded

Harry And I fear Sir Michael What with the sickness of Northumberland Whose power was in the first proportion And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence Who with them was a rated sinew too And comes

did outdare The dangers of the time You swore to us And you did swear that oath at Doncaster That you did nothing purpose gainst the state Nor claim no further than your newfalln right The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster To this we swore our aid But in short space It raind down fortune showring on your head And such a flood of greatness fell on you What with our help what with the absent King What with the injuries of a wanton time The seeming sufferances that you had borne And the contrarious winds that held the King So long in his unlucky Irish wars That all in England did repute him dead And from this swarm of fair advantages You took occasion to be quickly wood To gripe the general sway into your hand Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster And being fed by us you used us so As that ungentle gull the cuckoos bird Useth the sparrowdid oppress our nest Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk That even our love durst not come near your sight For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing We were enforced for safety sake to fly Out of your sight and raise this present head Whereby we stand opposed by such means As you yourself have forged against yourself By unkind usage dangerous countenance And violation of all faith and troth Sworn to us in your younger enterprise KING These things indeed you have articulate Proclaimd at market crosses read in churches To face the garment of rebellion With some fine colour that may please the eye Of fickle changelings and poor discontents Which gape and rub the elbow at the news Of hurlyburly innovation And never yet did insurrection want Such watercolours to impaint his cause Nor moody beggars starving for a time Of pellmell havoc and confusionPRINCE In both your armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter If once they join in trial Tell your nephew The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy By my hopes This present enterprise set off his head I do not think

Try fortune with him in a single fight KING And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee Albeit considerations infinite Do make against itNo good Worcester no We love our people well even those we love That are misled upon your cousins part And will they take the offer of our grace Both he and they and you yea every man Shall be my friend again and Ill be his So tell your cousin and then bring me word What he will do But if he will not yield Rebuke and dread correction wait on us And they shall do their office So be gone We will not now be troubled with reply We offer fair take it advisedly

kind offer of the King VERNON Twere best he did WORCESTER Then are we all undone It is not possible it cannot be The King should keep his word in loving us He will suspect us still and find a time To punish this offence in other faults Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes For treason is but trusted like the fox Who neer so tame so cherishd and lockd up Will have a wild trick of his ancestors Look how we can or sad or merrily Interpretation will misquote our looks And we shall feed like oxen at a stall The better cherishd still the nearer death My nephews trespass may be well forgot It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood And an adopted name of privilege A harebraind Hotspur governd by a spleen All his offences live upon my head And on his fathers We did train him on

might draw short breath today But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me How showd his tasking Seemd it in contempt VERNON No by my soul I never in my life Did hear a challenge urged more modestly Unless a brother should a brother dare To gentle exercise and proof of arms He gave you all the duties of a man Trimmd up your praises with a princely tongue Spoke your deservings like a chronicle Making you ever better than his praise By still dispraising praise valued with you And which became him like a prince indeed He made a blushing cital of himself And chid his truant youth with such a grace As if he masterd there a double spirit Of teaching and of learning instantly There did he pause but let me tell the world If he outlive the envy of this day England did never owe so sweet a hope So much misconstrued in his wantonness HOTSPUR Cousin I think thou art enamoured Upon his follies Never did I hear Of any prince so wild a liberty But be he as he will yet once ere night I will embrace him with a soldiers arm That he shall shrink under my courtesy Arm arm with speed And fellows soldiers friends Better consider what you have to do Than I that have not well the gift of tongue

die even when they to perfection grow Enter Curio and Clown DUKE O fellow come the song we had last night Mark it Cesario it is old and plain The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free

and I came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg O tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hanged fort sure as I live he had suffered fort You shall judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Dukes table he had not been therebless the marka pissingwhile but all the chamber smelt him Out with the dog says one What cur is that says another Whip him out says the third Hang him up says the Duke I having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs Friend quoth I you mean to whip the dog Ay marry do I quoth he You do him the more wrong quoth I Twas I did the thing you wot of He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber How many masters would do this for his servant Nay Ill be sworn I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had been executed I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed otherwise he had suffered fort To Crab Thou thinkst not of this now Nay I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia Did not I bid thee still mark me

picture Your message done hie home unto my chamber Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary Exit JULIA How many women would do such a message Alas poor Proteus thou hast entertained A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs Alas poor fool why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me Because he loves her he despiseth me Because I love him I must pity him This ring I gave him when he parted from me To bind him to remember my good will And now am I unhappy messenger To plead for that which I would not obtain To carry that which I would have refused To praise his faith which I would have dispraised I am my masters true confirmed love But cannot be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to myself Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly As heaven it knows I would not have him speed Enter Silvia attended Gentlewoman good day I pray you be my mean To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia SILVIA What would you with her if that I be she JULIA If you be she I do

pray thee let me look on that again JULIA It may not be Good madam pardon me SILVIA There hold I will not look upon your masters lines I know they are stuffed with protestations And full of newfound oaths which he will break As easily as I do tear his paper She tears the second letter JULIA Madam he sends your ladyship this ring SILVIA The more shame for him that he sends it me For I have heard him say a thousand times His Julia gave it him at his departure Though his false finger have profaned the ring Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong JULIA She thanks you SILVIA What sayst thou JULIA I thank you madam that you tender her Poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much SILVIA Dost thou know her JULIA Almost as well as I do know myself To think upon her woes I do protest That I have wept a hundred several times SILVIA Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her JULIA I think she doth and thats her cause of sorrow SILVIA Is she not passing fairJULIA She hath been fairer madam than she is When she did think my master loved her well She in my judgement was as fair as you But since she did neglect her lookingglass And threw her sunexpelling mask away The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks And pinched the lilytincture of her face That now she is become as black as I SILVIA How tall was she JULIA About my stature for at Pentecost When all our pageants of delight were played Our youth got me to play the womans part And I was trimmed in Madam Julias gown Which served me as fit by all mens judgements As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height And at that time I made her weep agood For I did play a lamentable part Madam twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress moved therewithal Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow SILVIA She is beholding to thee gentle youth Alas poor lady desolate and left I weep myself to think upon thy words Here youth there is my purse I give thee this For thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovst her Farewell JULIA And she shall thank you fort if eer you know her Exeunt Silvia and Attendants A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful I hope my masters suit will be but cold Since she respects my mistress love so much Alas how love can trifle with itself Here is her picture let me see I think If I had such a tire this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flattered her a little Unless I flatter with myself too much Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love Ill get me such a coloured periwig Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine Ay but her foreheads low and mines as high What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come shadow come and take this shadow up For tis thy rival O thou senseless form Thou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored And were there sense in his idolatry My substance should be statue in thy stead Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake That used me so or else by Jove I vow I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee Exit ACT V SCENE I Milan An abbey Enter Eglamour EGLAMOUR The sun begins to gild the western sky And

PROTEUS Ill when you talk of war THURIO But well when I discourse of love and peace JULIA Aside But better indeed when you hold your peace THURIO What says she to my valour PROTEUS O sir she makes no doubt of that JULIA Aside She needs not when she knows it cowardice THURIO What says she to my birth PROTEUS That you are well derived JULIA Aside True from a gentleman to a fool THURIO Considers she my possessions PROTEUS O ay and pities them THURIO Wherefore JULIA Aside That such an ass should owe them PROTEUS That they are out by lease JULIA Here comes the Duke Enter Duke DUKE How now Sir Proteus How now Thurio Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late THURIO Not I PROTEUS Nor I DUKE Saw you my daughter PROTEUS Neither DUKE Why then shes fled unto that peasant Valentine And Eglamour is in her company Tis true for Friar Lawrence met them both As he in penance wandered through the forest Him he knew well and guessed that it was she But being masked he was not sure of it Besides she did intend confession At Patricks cell this even and there she was not These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse But mount you presently and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads toward Mantua whither they are fled Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me Exit THURIO Why this it is to be a peevish girl That flies her fortune when it follows her Ill after more to be revenged on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Silvia Exit PROTEUS And I will follow more for Silvias love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her Exit JULIA And I will follow more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love Exit SCENE III Frontiers of Mantua The forest Enter Silvia and Outlaws FIRST OUTLAW Come come be patient We must

this I endure for thee Exeunt SCENE IV Another part of the forest Enter Valentine VALENTINE How use doth breed a habit in a man This shadowy desert unfrequented woods I better brook than flourishing peopled towns Here can I sit alone unseen of any And to the nightingales complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes O thou that dost inhabit in my breast Leave not the mansion so long tenantless Lest growing ruinous the building fall And leave no memory of what it was Repair me with thy presence Silvia Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain Shouts within What hallowing and what stir is this today These are my mates that make their wills their law Have some unhappy passenger in chase They love me well yet I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages Withdraw thee Valentine Whos this comes here Steps aside Enter Proteus Silvia and Julia as Sebastian PROTEUS Madam this service I have done for you Though you respect not aught your servant doth To hazard life and

Proteus Therefore be gone solicit me no more PROTEUS What dangerous action stood it next to death Would I not undergo for one calm look O tis the curse in love and still approved When women cannot love where theyre beloved SILVIA When Proteus cannot love where hes beloved Read over Julias heart thy first best love For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths Descended into perjury to love me Thou hast no faith left now unless thoudst two And thats far worse than none better have none Than plural faith which is too much by one Thou counterfeit

arms end And love you gainst the nature of loveforce ye He seizes her SILVIA O heaven PROTEUS Ill force thee yield to my desire VALENTINE Comes forward Ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch Thou friend of an ill fashion PROTEUS Valentine VALENTINE Thou common friend thats without faith or love For such is a friend now Treacherous man Thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me Who should be trusted when ones right hand Is perjured to the bosom Proteus I am sorry I must never trust thee more But count the world a stranger for thy sake The private wound is deepest O time most accurst Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst PROTEUS My shame and guilt confounds me Forgive me Valentine if hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence I tender t here I do as truly suffer As eer I did commit VALENTINE Then I am paid And once again I do receive thee honest Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased By penitence th Eternals wraths appeased And that my love may appear plain and free All that was mine in Silvia I give thee JULIA O me

the ring you sent to Silvia Shows another ring PROTEUS But how camst thou by this ring At my depart I gave this unto Julia JULIA And Julia herself did give it me And Julia herself have brought it hitherShe reveals herself PROTEUS How Julia JULIA Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths And entertained em deeply in her heart How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root O Proteus let this habit make thee blush Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment if shame live In a disguise of love It is the lesser blot modesty finds Women to change their shapes than men their minds PROTEUS Than men their minds Tis true O heaven were man But constant he were perfect That one error Fills him with faults makes him run through all th sins Inconstancy falls off ere it begins What is in Silvias face but I may spy More fresh in Julias with a constant eye VALENTINE Come come a hand from either Let me be blest to make this happy close Twere pity two such friends should

fifteen years since I saw my country Though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I oerween to think sowhich is another spur to my departure POLIXENES As thou lovst me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee Thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callst him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when sawest thou the Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues CAMILLO Sir it is three days since I saw the prince What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared POLIXENES I have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate CAMILLO I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage POLIXENES Thats likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some

we lie tumbling in the hay I have served Prince Florizel and in my time wore threepile but now I am out of service But shall I go mourn for that my dear The pale moon shines by night And when I wander

zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect TIMON O no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you How had you been my friends else Why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf And thus far I confirm you O you gods think I what need we have any friends if we should neer have need of em They were the most needless creatures living should we neer have use for em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious comfort tis to have so many like brothers commanding one anothers fortunes O joys een made away eret can be born Mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks To

lord how ample youre beloved Music Enter a masque of Ladies as Amazons with lutes in their hands dancing and playing APEMANTUS Hoyday What a sweep of vanity comes this way They dance They are madwomen Like madness is the glory of this life As this pomp shows to a little oil and root We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves And spend our flatteries to drink those men Upon whose age we void it up again With poisonous spite and envy Who lives thats not depraved or depraves Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves Of their friends gift I should fear those that dance before me now Would one day stamp upon me T has been done Men shut their doors against a setting sun The Lords rise from table with much adoring of Timon and to show their loves each singles out an Amazon and all dance

hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds TIMON Ill hunt with him and let them be received Not without fair reward Exit Servant FLAVIUS Aside What will this come to He commands us to provide and give great gifts And all out of an empty coffer Nor will he know his purse or yield me this To show him what a beggar his heart is Being of no power to make his wishes good His promises fly so beyond his state That what he speaks is all in debt he owes For every word He is so kind that he now Pays interest for t his lands put to their books Well would I were gently put out of office Before I were forced out Happier is he that has no friend to feed Than such that do een enemies exceed I bleed inwardly for my lord Exit TIMON You do yourselves much wrong You bate too much of your own merits Here my lord a trifle of our love SECOND LORD With more than common thanks I will receive it THIRD LORD O hes the very soul of bounty TIMON And now I remember my lord you gave good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on Tis yours because you liked it THIRD LORD O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that TIMON You may take my word my lord I know no man Can justly praise but what

jutting out of bums I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums That are given for em Friendships full of dregs Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies TIMON Now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen I would be good to thee APEMANTUS No Ill nothing for if I should be bribed too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster Thou givst so long Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly What needs these feasts pomps and vainglories TIMON Nay an you begin to rail on society once I am sworn not to give regard to you Farewell and come with better music Exit APEMANTUS So Thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then Ill lock thy heaven from thee O that mens ears should be To counsel deaf but not to flattery Exit ACT II SCENE I Athens A room in a senators house Enter a Senator with papers SENATOR And late five thousand To Varro and to Isidore He owes nine thousand besides my former sum Which makes it fiveandtwenty Still in motion Of raging waste It cannot hold it will not If I want gold steal but a beggars dog And give it Timon why the dog coins gold If I would sell my

his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items PHILARIO You speak of him when he was less furnishd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within FRENCHMAN I have seen him in France we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he IACHIMO This matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I doubt not a great deal from the matter FRENCHMAN And then his banishment IACHIMO Ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgement which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintance PHILARIO His father and I were soldiers together to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life Enter Posthumus Here comes the Briton Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine How worthy he is I will leave to appear

still FRENCHMAN Sir you oerrate my poor kindness I was glad I did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature POSTHUMUS By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller rather shunnd to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others experiences but upon my mended judgement if I offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight FRENCHMAN Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have falln both IACHIMO Can we with manners ask what was the difference FRENCHMAN Safely I think Twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report It was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in FranceIACHIMO That lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this worn out POSTHUMUS She holds her virtue still and I my mind IACHIMO You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy POSTHUMUS Being so far provokd as I was in France I would abate her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend IACHIMO As fair and as gooda kind of handinhand comparisonhad been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain If she went

too So your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a thatwayaccomplishd courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last POSTHUMUS Your Italy contains none so accomplishd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ring PHILARIO Let us leave here gentlemen POSTHUMUS Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first IACHIMO With five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friend POSTHUMUS No no IACHIMO I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion oervalues it something But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any lady in the world POSTHUMUS You are a great deal abusd in too bold a persuasion and I doubt not you sustain what yare worthy of by your attempt IACHIMO Whats that POSTHUMUS A repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too PHILARIO Gentlemen enough of this It came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquainted IACHIMO Would I had put my estate and my neighbours on th approbation of what I have spoke POSTHUMUS What lady would you choose to assail IACHIMO Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reservd POSTHUMUS I will wage against your gold gold to it My ring I hold dear as my finger tis part of it IACHIMO You are a friend and therein the wiser If you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting But I see you have some religion in you that you fear POSTHUMUS This is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose I hope IACHIMO I am the master of my speeches and would undergo whats spoken I swear POSTHUMUS Will you I shall but lend my diamond till your return Let there be covenants drawn betweens My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to this match heres my ring PHILARIO I will have it no lay IACHIMO By the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyd the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too If I come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment POSTHUMUS I embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevaild I am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseducd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and

the trumpets sound While we return these dukes what we decree A long flourish To the Combatants Draw near And list what with our council we have done For that our kingdoms earth should not be soiled With that dear blood which it hath fostered And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect Of civil wounds ploughed up with neighbours swords And for we think the eaglewinged pride Of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts With rivalhating envy set on you To wake our peace which in our countrys cradle Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep Which so roused up with boistrous untuned drums With harshresounding trumpets dreadful bray And grating shock of wrathful iron arms Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace And make us wade even in our kindreds blood Therefore we banish you our

thee upon pain of life MOWBRAY A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege And all unlooked for from your highness mouth A dearer merit not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air Have I deserved at your highness hands The language I have learnt these forty years My native English now I must forgo And now my tongues use is to me no more Than an unstringed viol or a harp Or like a cunning instrument cased up Or being open put into his hands That knows no touch to tune the harmony Within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue Doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips And dull unfeeling barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me I am too old to fawn upon a nurse Too far in years to be a pupil now What is thy sentence then but speechless death Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath KING RICHARD It boots thee not to be compassionate After our sentence plaining comes too late MOWBRAY Then thus I turn me from my countrys light To dwell in solemn shades of endless night Retiring KING RICHARD Return again and take an oath with thee Lay on our royal sword your banished hands Swear by the duty that you owe to God Our part therein we banish with yourselves To keep the oath that we administer You never shall so help you truth and God Embrace each others love in banishment Nor never look upon each others face Nor never write regreet nor

stray Save back to England all the worlds my way Exit KING RICHARD Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes I see thy grieved heart Thy sad aspect Hath from the number of his banished years Plucked four away To Bolingbroke Six frozen winters spent Return with welcome home from banishment BOLINGBROKE How long a time lies in one little word Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word such is the breath of kings GAUNT I thank my liege that in regard of me He shortens four years of my sons exile But little vantage shall I reap thereby For ere the six years that he hath to spend Can change their moons and bring their times about My oildried lamp and timebewasted light Shall be extinct with age and endless night My inch of taper will be burnt and done And blindfold death not let me see my son KING RICHARD Why uncle thou hast many years to live GAUNT But not a minute king that thou canst give Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow Thou canst help time to furrow me with age But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage Thy word is current with him for my death But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath KING RICHARD Thy son is banished upon good advice Whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave Why at our justice seemst thou then to lour GAUNT Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour You urged me as a judge but I had rather You would have bid me argue like a father O had it been a stranger not my child To smooth his fault I should have been more mild A partial slander sought I to avoid And in the sentence my own life destroyed Alas I looked when some of you should say I was too strict to make mine own away But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue Against my will to do myself this wrong KING RICHARD Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so Six years we banish him and he shall go Flourish Exit King Richard and Train AUMERLE Cousin farewell What presence must not know From where you do remain let paper show

have too few to take my leave of you When the tongues office should be prodigal To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart GAUNT Thy grief is but thy absence for a time BOLINGBROKE Joy absent grief is present for that time GAUNT What is six winters They are quickly gone BOLINGBROKE To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten GAUNT Call it a travel that thou takst for pleasure BOLINGBROKE My heart will sigh when I miscall it so Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage GAUNT The sullen passage of thy weary steps Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set The precious jewel of thy home return BOLINGBROKE Nay rather every tedious stride I make Will but remember me what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love Must I not serve a long apprenticehood To foreign passages and in the end Having my freedom boast of nothing else But that I was a journeyman to grief GAUNT All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens Teach thy necessity to reason thus There is no virtue like necessity Think not the King did banish thee But thou the King Woe doth the heavier sit Where it perceives it is but faintly borne Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour And not the King exiled thee or suppose Devouring pestilence hangs in our air And thou art flying to a fresher clime Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it To lie that way thou goest not whence thou comst Suppose the singing birds musicians The grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewed The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more Than a delightful measure or a dance For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite The man that mocks at it and sets it light BOLINGBROKE O who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast Or wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantastic summers heat O no the apprehension of the good Gives but the greater feeling to the worse Fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more Than when it bites but lanceth not the sore GAUNT Come come my son Ill bring thee on thy way Had I thy youth and cause I would not stay BOLINGBROKE Then Englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu My mother and my nurse that bears me yet Whereer I wander boast of this I can Though banished yet a trueborn Englishman Exeunt SCENE IV London A Room in the Kings Castle Enter King

the next highway and there I left him KING RICHARD And say what store of parting tears were shed AUMERLE Faith none for me except the northeast wind Which then blew bitterly against our faces Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance Did grace our hollow parting with a tear KING RICHARD What said our cousin when you parted with him AUMERLE Farewell And for my heart disdained that my tongueShould so profane the word that taught me craft To counterfeit oppression of such grief That words seemed buried in my sorrows grave Marry would the word farewell have lengthened hours And added years to his short banishment He should have had a volume of farewells But since it would not he had none of me KING RICHARD He is our cousin cousin but tis doubt When time shall call him home from banishment Whether our kinsman come to see his friends Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green Observed his courtship to the common people How he did seem to dive into their hearts With humble and familiar courtesy What reverence he did throw away on slaves Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles And patient underbearing of his fortune As twere to banish their affects with him Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench A brace of draymen bid God speed him well And had the tribute of his supple knee With Thanks my countrymen my loving friends As were our England in reversion his And he our subjects next degree in hope GREEN Well he is gone and with him go these thoughts Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland Expedient manage must be made my liege Ere further leisure yield them further means For their advantage and your highness loss KING RICHARD We will ourself in person to this war And for our coffers with too great a court And liberal largess are grown somewhat light We are enforced to farm our royal realm The revenue whereof shall furnish us For our affairs in hand If that come short Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters Whereto when they shall know what men are rich They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold And send them after to supply our wants For we will make for Ireland presently Enter Bushy Bushy what news BUSHY Old John of Gaunt is grievous

Exeunt ACT II SCENE I London An Apartment in Ely House Gaunt on a couch the Duke of York and Others standing by him GAUNT Will the King come that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth YORK Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath For all in vain comes counsel to his ear GAUNT O but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain He that no more must say is listened more Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose More are mens ends marked than their lives before The setting sun and music at the close As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last Writ in remembrance more than things long past Though Richard my lifes counsel would not hear My deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear YORK No it is stopped with other flattering sounds As praises of whose state the wise are fond Lascivious metres to whose venom sound The open ear of youth doth always listen Report of fashions in proud Italy Whose manners still our tardyapish nation Limps after in base imitation Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity So it be new theres no respect how vile That is not quickly buzzed into his ears Then all too late comes counsel to be heard Where will doth mutiny with wits regard Direct not him whose way himself will choose Tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose GAUNT Methinks I am a prophet new inspired And thus expiring do foretell of him His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last For violent fires soon burn out themselves Small showers last long but sudden storms are short He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder Light vanity insatiate cormorant Consuming means soon preys upon itself This royal throne of kings this sceptered isle This earth of majesty this seat of Mars This other Eden demiparadise This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war This happy breed of men this little world This precious stone set in the silver sea Which serves it in the office of a wall Or as a moat defensive to a house Against the envy of less happier lands This blessed plot this earth this realm this England This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings Feared by their breed and famous by their birth Renowned for their deeds as far from home For Christian service and true chivalry As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry Of the worlds ransom blessed Marys Son This land of such dear souls this dear dear land Dear for her reputation through the world Is now leased outI die pronouncing it Like to a tenement or pelting farm England bound in with the triumphant sea Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege Of watry Neptune is now bound in with shame With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds That England that was wont to conquer others Hath made a shameful conquest of itself Ah would the scandal vanish with my life How happy then were my ensuing death Enter King Richard and Queen Aumerle Bushy Green Bagot Ross and Willoughby YORK The King is come Deal mildly with his youth For young hot colts being raged do rage the more QUEEN How fares our noble uncle Lancaster KING RICHARD What comfort man How ist with aged Gaunt GAUNT O how that name befits my composition Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt For sleeping England long time have I watched Watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt The pleasure that some fathers feed upon Is my strict fastI mean my childrens looks And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones KING RICHARD Can sick men play so nicely with their names GAUNT No misery makes sport to mock itself Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me I mock my name great king to flatter thee KING RICHARD Should dying men flatter with those that live GAUNT No no men living flatter those that die KING RICHARD Thou now adying sayest thou flatterest me GAUNT O no thou diest though I the sicker be KING RICHARD I am in health I breathe and see thee ill GAUNT Now He that made me knows I see thee ill Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land Wherein thou liest in reputation sick And thou too careless patient as thou art Committst thy anointed body to the cure Of those physicians that first wounded thee A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown Whose compass is no bigger than thy head And yet encaged in so small a verge The waste is no whit lesser than thy land O had thy grandsire with a prophets eye Seen how his sons son should destroy his sons From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame Deposing thee before thou wert possessed Which art possessed now to depose thyself Why cousin wert thou regent of the world It were a shame to let this land by lease But for thy world enjoying but this land Is it not more than shame to shame it so Landlord of England art thou now not king Thy state of law is bondslave to the law And thou KING RICHARD A lunatic leanwitted fool Presuming on an agues privilege Darest with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood With fury from his native residence Now by my seats right royal majesty Wert thou not brother to great Edwards son This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders GAUNT O spare me not my brother Edwards son For that I was his father Edwards son That blood already like the pelican Hast thou tapped out and drunkenly caroused My brother Gloucester plain wellmeaning soul Whom fair befall in heaven mongst happy souls May be a precedent and witness good That thou respectst not spilling Edwards blood Join with the present sickness that I have And thy unkindness be like crooked age To crop at once a toolong withered flower Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee These words hereafter thy tormentors be Convey me to my bed then to my grave Love they to live that love and honour have Exit borne off by his Attendants KING RICHARD And let them die that age and sullens have For both hast thou and both become the grave YORK I do beseech your Majesty impute his words To wayward sickliness and age in him He loves you on my life and holds you dear As Harry Duke of Hereford were he here KING RICHARD Right you say true as Herefords love so his As theirs so mine and all be as it is Enter Northumberland NORTHUMBERLAND My liege old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty KING RICHARD What says he NORTHUMBERLAND Nay nothing all is said His tongue is now a stringless instrument Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent YORK Be York the next that must be bankrupt so Though death be poor it ends a mortal woe KING RICHARD The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he His time is spent our pilgrimage must be So much for that Now for our Irish wars We must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns Which live like venom where no venom else But only they have privilege to live And for these great affairs do ask some charge Towards our assistance we do seize to us The plate coin revenues and moveables Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessed YORK How long shall I be patient Ah how long Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong Not Gloucesters death nor Herefords banishment Nor Gaunts rebukes nor Englands private wrongs Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke About his marriage nor my own disgrace Have ever made me sour my patient cheek Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face I am the last of noble Edwards sons Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first In war was never lion raged more fierce In peace was never gentle lamb more mild Than was that young and princely gentleman His face thou hast for even so looked he Accomplished with the number of thy hours But when he frowned it was against the French And not against his friends His noble hand Did win what he did spend and spent not that Which his triumphant fathers hand had wonHis hands were guilty of no kindreds blood But bloody with the enemies of his kin O Richard York is too far gone with grief Or else he never would compare between KING RICHARD Why uncle whats the matter YORK O my liege Pardon me if you please if not I pleased Not to be pardoned am content withal Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banished Hereford Is not Gaunt dead And doth not Hereford live Was not Gaunt just And is not Harry true Did not the one deserve to have an heir Is not his heir a welldeserving son Take Herefords rights away and take from Time His charters and his customary rights Let not tomorrow then ensue today Be not thyself for how art thou a king But by fair sequence and succession Now afore GodGod forbid I say true If you do wrongfully seize Herefords rights Call in the letters patents that he hath By his attorneysgeneral to sue His livery and deny his offered homage You pluck a thousand dangers on your head You lose a thousand welldisposed hearts And prick my tender patience to those thoughts Which honour and allegiance cannot think KING RICHARD Think what you will we seize into our hands His plate his goods his money and his lands YORK Ill not be by the while My liege farewell What will ensue hereof theres none can tell But by bad courses may be understood That their events can never fall out good Exit KING RICHARD Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight Bid him repair to us to Ely House To see this business Tomorrow next We will for Ireland and tis time I trow And we create in absence of ourself Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England For he is just

aside lifeharming heaviness And entertain a cheerful disposition QUEEN To please the King I did to please myself I cannot do it Yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as grief Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard Yet again methinks Some unborn sorrow ripe in Fortunes womb Is coming towards me and my inward soul With nothing trembles At something it grieves More than with parting from my lord the King BUSHY Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows Which shows like grief itself but is not so For sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears Divides one thing entire to many objects Like perspectives which rightly gazed upon Show nothing but confusion eyed awry Distinguish form So your sweet Majesty Looking awry upon your lords departure Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail Which looked on as it is is naught but shadows Of what it is not Then thricegracious Queen More than your lords departure weep not More is not seen Or if it

thought in thinking on no thought I think Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink BUSHY Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady QUEEN Tis nothing less Conceit is still derived From some forefather grief Mine is not so For nothing hath begot my something grief Or something hath the nothing that I grieve Tis in reversion that I do possess But what it is that is not yet known what I cannot name Tis nameless woe I wot Enter Green GREEN God save your majesty And well met gentlemen I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland QUEEN Why hopst thou so Tis better hope he is For his

baas like a bear MENENIUS Hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb You two are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you BOTH TRIBUNES Well sir MENENIUS In what enormity is Martius poor in that you two have not in abundance BRUTUS Hes poor in no one fault but stored with all SICINIUS Especially in pride BRUTUS And topping all others in boasting MENENIUS This is strange now Do you two know how you are censured here in the city I mean of us o th righthand file do you BOTH TRIBUNES Why how are we censured MENENIUS Because you talk of pride now will you not be angry BOTH TRIBUNES Well well sir well MENENIUS Why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame Martius for being proud BRUTUS We do it not alone sir MENENIUS I know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single Your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone You talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O that you could BOTH TRIBUNES What then sir MENENIUS Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in Rome SICINIUS Menenius you are known well enough too MENENIUS I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath Meeting two such wealsmen as you areI cannot call you Lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I cannot say your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables And though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces If you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough too BRUTUS Come sir come we know you well enough MENENIUS You know neither me yourselves nor anything You are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and a faucetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves You are a pair of strange ones BRUTUS Come come You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss packsaddle Yet you must be saying Martius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen Good een to your Worships More of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you He begins to exit Brutus and Sicinius stand aside Enter Volumnia Virgilia and Valeria How now my as fair as noble ladiesand the

advanced declines and then men die A sennet Enter Cominius the General and Titus Lartius between them Coriolanus crowned with an oaken garland with Captains and Soldiers and a Herald Trumpets sound

doubt not but Our Rome will cast upon thee CORIOLANUS Know good mother I had rather be their servant in my way Than sway with them in theirs COMINIUS On to the Capitol Flourish of cornets Exeunt in state as before Brutus and Sicinius come forward BRUTUS All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights Are spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse Into a rapture lets her baby cry While she chats him The kitchen malkin pins Her richest lockram bout her reechy neck Clambring the walls to eye him Stalls bulks windows Are smothered up leads filled and ridges horsed With variable complexions all agreeing In earnestness to see him Seldshown flamens Do press among the popular throngs and puff To win a vulgar station Our veiled dames Commit the war of white and damask in Their nicelygauded cheeks to th wanton spoil Of Phoebus burning kisses Such a pother As if that whatsoever god who leads him Were slyly crept into his human powers And gave him graceful posture SICINIUS On the sudden I warrant him consul BRUTUS Then our office may During his power go sleep SICINIUS He cannot temprately transport his honours From where he should begin and end but will Lose those he hath won BRUTUS In that theres comfort SICINIUS Doubt not the commoners for whom we stand But they upon their ancient malice will forget With the least cause these his new honourswhich That he will give them make as little question As he is proud to dot BRUTUS I heard him swear Were he to stand for consul never would he Appear i th marketplace nor on him put The napless vesture of humility Nor showing as the manner is his wounds To th people beg their stinking breaths SICINIUS Tis right BRUTUS It was his word O he would miss it ratherThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him And the desire of the nobles SICINIUS I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution BRUTUS Tis most like he will SICINIUS It shall be to him then as our good wills A sure destruction BRUTUS So it must fall out To him or our authorities for an end We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them that tos power he would Have made them mules silenced their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms holding them In human action and capacity Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in their war who have their provand Only for bearing burdens and sore blows For sinking under them SICINIUS This as you say suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want If it be put upont and thats as easy As to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever Enter a Messenger BRUTUS Whats the matter MESSENGER You are sent for to the Capitol Tis thought That Martius shall be consul I have seen The dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs Upon him as he passed the nobles bended As to Joves statue and the Commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like BRUTUS Lets to the Capitol And carry with us ears and eyes for th time But hearts for the event SICINIUS Have with you Exeunt SCENE II Rome The Capitol Enter two Officers to lay cushions as it were in the Capitol FIRST OFFICER Come come They are almost here How many stand for consulships SECOND OFFICER Three they say but tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it FIRST OFFICER Thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury To report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it FIRST OFFICER No more of him hes a worthy man Make way They are coming A sennet Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the people Lictors before them Coriolanus Menenius Cominius the consul The Patricians sit Sicinius and Brutus take their places by themselves Coriolanus stands MENENIUS Having determined of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius it remains As the main point of this our aftermeeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our wellfound successes to report A little of that worthy work performed By Martius Caius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself Coriolanus sits FIRST SENATOR Speak good Cominius Leave nothing out for length and make us think Rather our states defective for requital Than we to stretch it out Masters o th people We do request your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here SICINIUS We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly BRUTUS Which the rather We shall be blest to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at MENENIUS Thats off thats off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speak BRUTUS Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it MENENIUS He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speak Coriolanus rises and offers to go away Nay keep your place FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear What you have nobly done CORIOLANUS Your Honours pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them BRUTUS Sir I hope My words disbenched you not CORIOLANUS No sir Yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You soothed not therefore hurt not but your people I love them as they weigh MENENIUS Pray now sit down CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered Exit MENENIUS Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one ons ears to hear itProceed Cominius COMINIUS I shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver if it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him He bestrid An oerpressed Roman and i th Consuls view Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met And struck him on his knee In that days feats When he might act the woman in the scene He proved best man i th field and for his meed Was browbound with the oak His pupil age Manentered thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurched all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioles let me say I cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport As weeds before A vessel under sail so men obeyed And fell below his stem His sword Deaths stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was timed with dying cries Alone he entered The mortal gate o th city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioles like a planet Now alls his When by and by the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Requickened what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking oer the lives of men as if Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting MENENIUS Worthy man FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at And looked upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it MENENIUS Hes right noble Let him be called for FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus OFFICER He doth appear Enter Coriolanus MENENIUS The Senate Coriolanus are well pleased To make thee consul CORIOLANUS I do owe them still My life and services MENENIUS It then remains That you do speak to the people CORIOLANUS I do beseech you Let me oerleap that custom for I cannot Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds sake to give their suffrage Please you That I may pass this doing SICINIUS Sir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony MENENIUS Put them not tot Pray you go fit you to the custom and Take to you as your predecessors have Your honour with your form CORIOLANUS It is a part That I shall blush in acting and might well Be taken from the people BRUTUS Mark you that CORIOLANUS To brag unto them thus I did and thus Show them th unaching scars which I should hide As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only MENENIUS Do not stand upont We recommend to you tribunes of the people Our purpose to them and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour SENATORS To Coriolanus come all joy and honour Flourish cornets Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus BRUTUS You see how he intends to use the people SICINIUS May they perceives intent He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give BRUTUS Come well inform them Of our proceedings here On th marketplace I know they do attend us Exeunt SCENE III Rome The Forum Enter seven or eight Citizens FIRST CITIZEN Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him SECOND CITIZEN We may sir if we will THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them So if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude THIRD CITIZEN We have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o th compass SECOND CITIZEN Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would flyTHIRD CITIZEN Nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans will tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead But if it were at liberty twould sure southward SECOND CITIZEN Why that way THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife SECOND CITIZEN You are never without your tricks You may you may THIRD CITIZEN Are you all resolved to give your voices But thats no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility with Menenius Here he comes and in the gown of humility Mark his behaviour We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes Hes to make his requests by particulars wherein everyone of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues Therefore follow me and Ill direct you how you shall go by him ALL Content content Exeunt MENENIUS O sir you are not right Have you not known The worthiest men have donet CORIOLANUS What must I say I pray sirplague upont I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace Look sir my wounds I got them in my countrys service when Some certain of your brethren roared and

is of my wailing chief A loss in love that touches me more nearly Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her And for my sake even so doth she abuse me Suffring my friend for my sake to approve her If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain And losing her my friend hath found that loss Both find each other and I lose both twain And both for my sake lay on me this cross But heres the joy my friend and I are one Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone 43 When most I wink then do mine eyes best see For all the day they view things unrespected But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee And darkly bright are bright in dark directed Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadows form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so How would I say mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay All days are nights to see till I see thee And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 44 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought Injurious distance should not stop my way For then despite of space I would be brought From limits far remote where thou dost stay No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be But ah thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone But that so much of earth and water wrought I must attend times leisure with my moan Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears badges of eithers woe 45 The other two slight air and purging fire Are both with thee wherever I abide The first my thought the other my desire These presentabsent with swift motion slide For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee My life being made of four with two alone Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy Until lifes composition be recured By those swift messengers returned from thee Who even but now come back again assured Of thy fair health recounting it to me This told I joy but then no longer glad I send them back again and straight grow sad 46 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar My heart mine eye the freedom of that right My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie A closet never pierced with crystal eyes But the defendant doth that plea deny And says in him thy fair appearance lies To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart And by their verdict is determined The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part And my hearts right thy inward love of heart 47 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took And each doth good turns now unto the other When that mine eye is famished for a look Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother With my loves picture then my eye doth feast And to the painted banquet bids my heart Another time mine eye is my hearts guest And in his thoughts of love doth share a part So either by thy picture or my love Thyself away art present still with me For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move And I am still with them and they with thee Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight 48 How careful was I when I took my way Each trifle under truest bars to thrust That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust But thou to whom my jewels trifles are Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief Thou best of dearest and mine only care Art left the prey of every vulgar thief Thee have I not locked up in any chest Save where thou art not though I feel thou art Within the gentle closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 49 Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my defects When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws Since why to love I can allege no cause 50 How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary travels end Doth teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend The beast that bears me tired with my woe Plods dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide Which heavily he answers with a groan More sharp to me than spurring to his side For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind 51 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of perfectst love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went wilfulslow Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go 52 So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure The which he will not every hour survey For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like stones of worth they thinly placed are Or captain jewels in the carcanet So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hideTo make some special instant specialblest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope Being had to triumph being lacked to hope 53 What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe Adonis and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you On Helens cheek all art of beauty set And you in Grecian tires are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty doth appear And you in every blessed shape we know In all external grace you have some part But you like none none you for constant heart 54 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly When summers breath their masked buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made And so of you beauteous and lovely youth When that shall fade my verse distills your truth 55 Not marble nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time When wasteful war shall statues overturn And broils root out the work of masonry Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory Gainst death and alloblivious enmity Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom So till the judgement that yourself arise You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes 56 Sweet love renew thy force be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite Which but today by feeding is allayed Tomorrow sharpened in his former might So love be thou although today thou fill Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness Tomorrow see again and do not kill The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore where two contracted new Come daily to the banks that when they see Return of love more blest may be the view Or call it winter which being full of care Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare 57 Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend Nor services to do till you require Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be or your affairs suppose But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are how happy you make those So true a fool is love that in your will Though you do any thing he thinks no ill 58 That god forbid that made me first your slave I should in thought control your times of pleasure Or at your hand th account of hours to crave Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure O let me suffer being at your beck Th imprisoned absence of your liberty And patience tame to sufferance bide each check Without accusing you of injury Be where you list your charter is so strong That you yourself may privilage your time To what you will to you it doth belong Yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime I am to wait though waiting so be hell Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well 59 If there be nothing new but that which is Hath been before how are our brains beguiled Which labouring for invention bear amiss The second burthen of a former child O that record could with a backward look Even of five hundred courses of the sun Show me your image in some antique book Since mind at first in character was done That I might see what the old world could say To this composed wonder of your frame Whether we are mended or whether better they Or whether revolution be the same O sure I am the wits of former days To subjects worse have given admiring praise 60 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore So do our minutes hasten to their end Each changing place with that which goes before In sequent toil all forwards do contend Nativity once in the main of light Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight And Time that gave doth now his gift confound Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beautys brow Feeds on the rarities of natures truth And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand 61 Is it thy will thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken While shadows like to thee do mock my sight Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry To find out shames and idle hours in me The scope and tenure of thy jealousy O no thy love though much is not so great It is my love that keeps mine eye awake Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat To play the watchman ever for thy sake For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere From me far off with others all too near 62 Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye And all my soul and all my every part And for this sin there is no remedy It is so grounded inward in my heart Methinks no face so gracious is as mine No shape so true no truth of such account And for my self mine own worth do define As I all other in all worths surmount But when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity Mine own selflove quite contrary I read Self so selfloving were iniquity Tis thee myself that for myself I praise Painting my age with beauty of thy days 63 Against my love shall be as I am now With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn Hath travelled on to ages steepy night And all those beauties whereof now hes king Are vanishing or vanished out of sight Stealing away the treasure of his spring For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding ages cruel knife That he shall never cut from memory My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life His beauty shall in these black lines be seen And they shall live and he in them still green 64 When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced The richproud cost of outworn buried age When sometime lofty towers I see downrased And brass eternal slave to mortal rage When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore And the firm soil win of the watery main Increasing store with loss and loss with store When I have seen such interchange of State Or state it self confounded to decay Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate That Time will come and take my love away This thought is as a death which cannot choose But weep to have that which it fears to lose 65 Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea But sad mortality oersways their power How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea Whose action is no stronger than a flower O how shall summers honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of battring days When rocks impregnable are not so stout Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays O fearful meditation where alack Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid O none unless this miracle have might That in black ink my love may still shine bright 66 Tired with all these for restful death I cry As to behold desert a beggar born And needy nothing trimmed in jollity And purest faith unhappily forsworn And gilded honour shamefully misplaced And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted And right perfection wrongfully disgraced And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tonguetied by authority And folly doctorlike controlling skill And simple truth miscalled simplicity And captive good attending captain ill Tired with all these from these would I be gone Save that to die I leave my love alone 67 Ah wherefore with infection should he live And with his presence grace impiety That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace it self with his society Why should false painting imitate his cheek And steal dead seeming of his living hue Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow since his rose is true Why should he live now nature bankrupt is Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins For she hath no exchequer now but his And proud of many lives upon his gains O him she stores to show what wealth she had In days long since before these last so bad 68 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn When beauty lived and died as flowers do now Before these bastard signs of fair were born Or durst inhabit on a living brow Before the golden tresses of the dead The right of sepulchres were shorn away To live a second life on second head Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay In him those holy antique hours are seen Without all ornament it self and true Making no summer of anothers green Robbing no old to dress his beauty new And him as for a map doth Nature store To show false Art what beauty was of yore 69 Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned But those same tongues that give thee so thine own In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown They look into the beauty of thy mind And that in guess they measure by thy deeds Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds But why thy odour matcheth not thy show The soil is this that thou dost common grow 70 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect For slanders mark was ever yet the fair The ornament of beauty is suspect A crow that flies in heavens sweetest airSo thou be good slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater being wooed of time For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love And thou presentst a pure unstained prime Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days Either not assailed or victor being charged Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise To tie up envy evermore enlarged If some suspect of ill masked not thy show Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 71 No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell Nay if you read this line remember not The hand that writ it for I love you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot If thinking on me then should make you woe O if I say you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay Do not so much as my poor name rehearse But let your love even with my life decay Lest the wise world should look into your moan And mock you with me after I am gone 72 O lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love After my death dear love forget me quite For you in me can nothing worthy prove Unless you would devise some virtuous lie To do more for me than mine own desert And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart O lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue My name be buried where my body is And live no more to shame nor me nor you For I am shamed by that which I bring forth And so should you to love things nothing worth 73 That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves or none or few do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west Which by and by black night doth take away Deaths second self that seals up all in rest In me thou seest the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie As the deathbed whereon it must expire Consumed with that which it was nourished by This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong To love that well which thou must leave ere long 74 But be contented when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away My life hath in this line some interest Which for memorial still with thee shall stay When thou reviewest this thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee The earth can have but earth which is his due My spirit is thine the better part of me So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life The prey of worms my body being dead The coward conquest of a wretchs knife Too base of thee to be remembered The worth of that is that which it contains And that is this and this with thee remains 75 So are you to my thoughts as food to life Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground And for the peace of you I hold such strife As twixt a miser and his wealth is found Now proud as an enjoyer and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure Now counting best to be with you alone Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure Sometime all full with feasting on your sight And by and by clean starved for a look Possessing or pursuing no delight Save what is had or must from you be took Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day Or gluttoning on all or all away 76 Why is my verse so barren of new pride So far from variation or quick change Why with the time do I not glance aside To newfound methods and to compounds strange Why write I still all one ever the same And keep invention in a noted weed That every word doth almost tell my name Showing their birth and where they did proceed O know sweet love I always write of you And you and love are still my argument So all my best is dressing old words new Spending again what is already spent For as the sun is daily new and old So is my love still telling what is told 77 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear And of this book this learning mayst thou taste The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show Of mouthed graves will give thee memory Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know Times thievish progress to eternity Look what thy memory cannot contain Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find Those children nursed delivered from thy brain To take a new acquaintance of thy mind These offices so oft as thou wilt look Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book 78 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly Have added feathers to the learneds wing And given grace a double majesty Yet be most proud of that which I compile Whose influence is thine and born of thee In others works thou dost but mend the style And arts with thy sweet graces graced be But thou art all my art and dost advance As high as learning my rude ignorance 79 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid My verse alone had all thy gentle grace But now my gracious numbers are decayed And my sick muse doth give an other place I grant sweet love thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of and pays it thee again He lends thee virtue and he stole that word From thy behaviour beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek he can afford No praise to thee but what in thee doth live Then thank him not for that which he doth say Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay 80 O how I faint when I of you do write Knowing a better spirit doth use your name And in the praise thereof spends all his might To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame But since your worth wide as the ocean is The humble as the proudest sail doth bear My saucy bark inferior far to his On your broad main doth wilfully appear Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat He of tall building and of goodly pride Then if he thrive and I be cast away The worst was this my love was my decay 81 Or I shall live your epitaph to make Or you survive when I in earth am rotten From hence your memory death cannot take Although in me each part will be forgotten Your name from hence immortal life shall have Though I once gone to all the world must die The earth can yield me but a common grave When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie Your monument shall be my gentle verse Which eyes not yet created shall oerread And tongues to be your being shall rehearse When all the breathers of this world are dead You still shall live such virtue hath my pen Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men 82 I grant thou wert not married to my muse And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject blessing every book Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue Finding thy worth a limit past my praise And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days And do so love yet when they have devised What strained touches rhetoric can lend Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized In true plain words by thy truetelling friend And their gross painting might be better used Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused 83 I never saw that you did painting need And therefore to your fair no painting set I found or thought I found you did exceed That barren tender of a poets debt And therefore have I slept in your report That you yourself being extant well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow This silence for my sin you did impute Which shall be most my glory being dumb For I impair not beauty being mute When others would give life and bring a tomb There lives more life in one of your fair eyes Than both your poets can in praise devise 84 Who is it that says most which can say more Than this rich praise that you alone are you In whose confine immured is the store Which should example where your equal grew Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory But he that writes of you if he can tell That you are you so dignifies his story Let him but copy what in you is writ Not making worse what nature made so clear And such a counterpart shall fame his wit Making his style admired every where You to your beauteous blessings add a curse Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse 85 My tonguetied muse in manners holds her still While comments of your praise richly compiled Reserve their character with golden quill And precious phrase by all the Muses filed I think good thoughts whilst other write good words And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen To every hymn that able spirit affords In polished form of well refined pen Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true And to the most of praise add something more But that is in my thought whose love to you Though words come hindmost holds his rank before Then others for the breath of words respect Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect 86 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse Bound for the prize of all too precious you That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead No neither he nor his compeers by night Giving him aid my verse astonished He nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence As victors of my silence cannot boast I was not sick of any fear from thence But when your countenance filled up his line Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine 87 Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing And like enough thou knowst thy estimate The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing My bonds in thee are all determinate For how do I hold thee but by thy granting And for that riches where is my deserving The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting And so my patent back again is swerving Thyself thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking So thy great gift upon misprision growingComes home again on better judgement making Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter In sleep a king but waking no such matter 88 When thou shalt be disposed to set me light And place my merit in the eye of scorn Upon thy side against my self Ill fight And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn With mine own weakness being best acquainted Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted That thou in losing me shalt win much glory And I by this will be a gainer too For bending all my loving thoughts on thee The injuries that to my self I do Doing thee vantage doublevantage me Such is my love to thee I so belong That for thy right my self will bear all wrong 89 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault And I will comment upon that offence Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt Against thy reasons making no defence Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill To set a form upon desired change As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will I will acquaintance strangle and look strange Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell Lest I too much profane should do it wrong And haply of our old acquaintance tell For thee against my self Ill vow debate For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate 90 Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow And do not drop in for an afterloss Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow Come in the rearward of a conquered woe Give not a windy night a rainy morrow To linger out a purposed overthrow If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last When other petty griefs have done their spite But in the onset come so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortunes might And other strains of woe which now seem woe Compared with loss of thee will not seem so 91 Some glory in their birth some in their skill Some in their wealth some in their bodys force Some in their garments though newfangled ill Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure Wherein it finds a joy above the rest But these particulars are not my measure All these I better in one general best Thy love is better than high birth to me Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs Of more delight than hawks and horses be And having thee of all mens pride I boast Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take All this away and me most wretched make 92 But do thy worst to steal thyself away For term of life thou art assured mine And life no longer than thy love will stay For it depends upon that love of thine Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs When in the least of them my life hath end I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humour doth depend Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie O what a happy title do I find Happy to have thy love happy to die But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not 93 So shall I live supposing thou art true Like a deceived husband so loves face May still seem love to me though altered new Thy looks with me thy heart in other place For there can live no hatred in thine eye Therefore in that I cannot know thy change In manys looks the false hearts history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show 94 They that have power to hurt and will do none That do not do the thing they most do show Who moving others are themselves as stone Unmoved cold and to temptation slow They rightly do inherit heavens graces And husband natures riches from expense They are the lords and owners of their faces Others but stewards of their excellence The summers flower is to the summer sweet Though to it self it only live and die But if that flower with base infection meet The basest weed outbraves his dignity For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 95 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which like a canker in the fragrant rose Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose That tongue that tells the story of thy days Making lascivious comments on thy sport Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise Naming thy name blesses an ill report O what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee Where beautys veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see Take heed dear heart of this large privilege The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge 96 Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport Both grace and faults are loved of more and less Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteemed So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated and for true things deemed How many lambs might the stern wolf betray If like a lamb he could his looks translate How many gazers mightst thou lead away If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state But do not so I love thee in such sort As thou being mine mine is thy good report 97 How like a winter hath my absence been From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year What freezings have I felt what dark days seen What old Decembers bareness everywhere And yet this time removed was summers time The teeming autumn big with rich increase Bearing the wanton burden of the prime Like widowed wombs after their lords decease Yet this abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit For summer and his pleasures wait on thee And thou away the very birds are mute Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer That leaves look pale dreading the winters near 98 From you have I been absent in the spring When proudpied April dressed in all his trim Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue Could make me any summers story tell Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew Nor did I wonder at the lilys white Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose They were but sweet but figures of delight Drawn after you you pattern of all those Yet seemed it winter still and you away As with your shadow I with these did play 99 The forward violet thus did I chide Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells If not from my loves breath The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed The lily I condemned for thy hand And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair The roses fearfully on thorns did stand One blushing shame another white despair A third nor red nor white had stoln of both And to his robbery had annexed thy breath But for his theft in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death More flowers I noted yet I none could see But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee 100 Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long To speak of that which gives thee all thy might Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem In gentle numbers time so idly spent Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem And gives thy pen both skill and argument Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey If time have any wrinkle graven there If any be a satire to decay And make times spoils despised everywhere Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife 101 O truant Muse what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed Both truth and beauty on my love depends So dost thou too and therein dignified Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay But best is best if never intermixed Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be praised of ages yet to be Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he shows now 102 My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming I love not less though less the show appear That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming The owners tongue doth publish every where Our love was new and then but in the spring When I was wont to greet it with my lays As Philomel in summers front doth sing And stops her pipe in growth of riper days Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night But that wild music burthens every bough And sweets grown common lose their dear delight Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue Because I would not dull you with my song 103 Alack what poverty my muse brings forth That having such a scope to show her pride The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace Were it not sinful then striving to mend To mar the subject that before was well For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell And more much more than in my verse can sit Your own glass shows you when you look in it 104 To me fair friend you never can be old For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such seems your beauty still three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers pride Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was beautys summer dead105 Let not my love be called idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my songs and praises be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined One thing expressing leaves out difference Fair kind and true is all my argument Fair kind and true varying to other words And in this change is my invention spent Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords Fair kind and true have often lived alone Which three till now never kept seat in one 106 When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they looked but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we which now behold these present days Have eyes to wonder but lack"

My lord for aught I know OTHELLO What dost thou think IAGO Think my lord OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou likst not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me Show me thy thought IAGO My lord you know I love you OTHELLO I think thou dost And for I know thourt full of love and honesty And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just Theyre close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule IAGO For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest OTHELLO I think so too IAGO Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem IAGO Why then I think Cassios an honest man OTHELLO Nay yet theres more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words IAGO Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As wheres that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear A stranger to thy thoughts IAGO I do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my natures plague To spy into abuses and of my jealousy Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts OTHELLO What dost thou mean IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed OTHELLO By heaven Ill know thy thoughts IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody OTHELLO Ha IAGO O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he oer Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves OTHELLO O misery IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy OTHELLO Why why is this Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolvd exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abusd Look tot I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience Is not to leave undone but keep unknown OTHELLO Dost thou say so IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most OTHELLO And so she did IAGO Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever IAGO I see this hath a little dashd your spirits OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot IAGO Trust me I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see youre movd I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion OTHELLO I will not IAGO Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend My lord I see youre movd OTHELLO No not much movd I do not think but Desdemonas honest IAGO Long live she so And long live you to think so OTHELLO And yet how nature erring from itself IAGO Ay theres the point As to be bold with you Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh One may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent OTHELLO Farewell farewell If more thou dost perceive let me know more Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago IAGO Going My lord I take my leave OTHELLO Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds IAGO Returning My lord I would I might entreat your honour To scan this thing no further Leave it to time Though it be fit that Cassio have his place For sure he fills it up with great ability Yet if you please to hold him off awhile You shall by that perceive him and his means Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity Much will be seen in that In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears As worthy cause I have to fear I am And hold her free I do beseech your honour OTHELLO Fear not my government IAGO I once more take my leave Exit OTHELLO This fellows of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings Id whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune Haply for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have or for I am declind Into the vale of yearsyet thats not much Shes gone I am abusd and my relief Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapour of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others uses Yet tis the plague of great ones Prerogativd are they less than the base Tis destiny unshunnable like death Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken Desdemona comes If she be false O then heaven mocks itself Ill not believet Enter Desdemona and Emilia DESDEMONA How now my dear Othello Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presence OTHELLO I am to blame DESDEMONA Why do you speak so faintly Are you not well OTHELLO I have a pain upon my forehead here DESDEMONA Faith thats with watching twill away again Let me but bind it hard within this hour It will be well OTHELLO Your napkin is too little He puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it Let it alone Come Ill go in with you DESDEMONA I am very sorry that you are not well Exeunt Othello and Desdemona EMILIA I am glad I have found this napkin This was her first remembrance from the Moor My wayward husband hath a hundred times Wood me to steal it But she so loves the token For he conjurd her she should ever keep it That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to Ill have the work taen out And givet Iago What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy Enter Iago IAGO How now What do you here alone EMILIA Do not you chide I have a thing for you IAGO A thing for me It is a common thing EMILIA Ha IAGO To have a foolish wife EMILIA O is that all What will you give me now For that same handkerchief IAGO What handkerchief EMILIA What handkerchief Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me steal IAGO Hast stoln it from her EMILIA No faith she let it drop by negligence And to the advantage I being here took t up Look here it is IAGO A good wench give it me EMILIA What will you do witht that you have been so earnestTo have me filch it IAGO Snatching it Why whats that to you EMILIA If it be not for some purpose of import Give t me again Poor lady shell run mad When she shall lack it IAGO Be not acknown ont I have use for it Go leave me Exit Emilia I will in Cassios lodging lose this napkin And let him find it Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ This may do something The Moor already changes with my poison Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so Enter Othello Look where he comes Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owdst yesterday OTHELLO Ha ha false to me IAGO Why how now general No more of that OTHELLO Avaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack I swear tis better to be much abusd Than but to knowt a little IAGO How now my lord OTHELLO What sense had I of her stoln hours of lust I sawt not thought it not it harmd not me I slept the next night well was free and merry I found not Cassios kisses on her lips He that is robbd not wanting what is stoln Let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all IAGO I am sorry to hear this OTHELLO I had been happy if the general camp Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body So I had nothing known O now for ever Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars That make ambition virtue O farewell Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war And O you mortal engines whose rude throats The immortal Joves dread clamours counterfeit Farewell Othellos occupations gone IAGO Ist possible my lord OTHELLO Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof Or by the worth of mans eternal soul Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my wakd wrath IAGO Ist come to this OTHELLO Make me to seet or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life IAGO My noble lord OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me Never pray more Abandon all remorse On horrors head horrors accumulate Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazd For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that IAGO O grace O heaven defend me Are you a man Have you a soul or sense God be wi you Take mine officeO wretched fool That livst to make thine honesty a vice O monstrous world Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe I thank you for this profit and from hence Ill love no friend sith love breeds such offence OTHELLO Nay stay Thou shouldst be honest IAGO I should be wise for honestys a fool And loses that it works for OTHELLO By the world I think my wife be honest and think she is not I think that thou art just and think thou art not Ill have some proof her name that was as fresh As Dians visage is now begrimd and black As mine own face If there be cords or knives Poison or fire or suffocating streams Ill not endure t Would I were satisfied IAGO I see sir you are eaten up with passion I do repent me that I put it to you You would be satisfied OTHELLO Would Nay I will IAGO And may but how How satisfied my lord Would you the supervisor grossly gape on Behold her toppd OTHELLO Death and damnation O IAGO It were a tedious difficulty I think To bring them to that prospect Damn them then If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own What then How then What shall I say Wheres satisfaction It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk But yet I say If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may havet OTHELLO Give me a living reason shes disloyal IAGO I do not like the office But sith I am enterd in this cause so far Prickd to t by foolish honesty and love I will go on I lay with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep There are a kind of men so loose of soul That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs One of this kind is Cassio In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona Let us be wary let us hide our loves And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard As if he pluckd up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips then laid his leg Over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then Cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor OTHELLO O monstrous monstrous IAGO Nay this was but his dream OTHELLO But this denoted a foregone conclusion Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream IAGO And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly OTHELLO Ill tear her all to pieces IAGO Nay but be wise Yet we see nothing done She may be honest yet Tell me but this Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand OTHELLO I gave her such a one twas my first gift IAGO I know not that but such a handkerchief I am sure it was your wifes did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with OTHELLO If it be that IAGO If it be that or any that was hers It speaks against her with the other proofs OTHELLO O that the slave had forty thousand lives One is too poor too weak for my revenge Now do I see tis true Look here Iago All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven Tis gone Arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught For tis of aspics tongues IAGO Yet be content OTHELLO O blood Iago blood IAGO Patience I say Your mind perhaps may change OTHELLO Never Iago Like to the Pontic Sea Whose icy current and compulsive course Neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven In the due reverence of a sacred vow Kneels I here engage my words IAGO Do not rise yet Kneels Witness you everburning lights above You elements that clip us round about Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit hands heart To wrongd Othellos service Let him command And to obey shall be in me remorse What bloody business ever They rise OTHELLO I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous And will upon the instant put thee to t Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassios not alive IAGO My friend is dead Tis done at your request But let her live OTHELLO Damn her lewd minx O damn her damn her Come go with me apart I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant IAGO I am your own for ever Exeunt SCENE IV Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Desdemona Emilia and Clown DESDEMONA Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies CLOWN I dare not say he lies anywhere DESDEMONA Why man CLOWN Hes a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing DESDEMONA Go to Where lodges he CLOWN To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie DESDEMONA Can anything be made of this CLOWN I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat DESDEMONA Can you inquire him out and be edified by report CLOWN I will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer DESDEMONA Seek him bid him come hither Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well CLOWN To do this is within the compass of mans wit and therefore I will attempt the doing it Exit DESDEMONA Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia EMILIA I know not madam DESDEMONA Believe me I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are it were enough To put him to ill thinking EMILIA Is he not jealous DESDEMONA Who he I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humours from him EMILIA Look where he comes Enter Othello DESDEMONA I will not leave him now till Cassio Be calld to him How ist with you my lord OTHELLO Well my good lady Aside O hardness to dissemble How do you Desdemona DESDEMONA Well my good lord OTHELLO Give me your hand This hand is moist my lady DESDEMONA It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow OTHELLO This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart Hot hot and moist This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer Much castigation exercise

sayI was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him SERVILIUS Yes sir I shall LUCIUS Ill look you out a good turn Servilius Exit Servilius True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed And he thats once denied will hardly speed Exit FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this Hostilius SECOND STRANGER Ay too well FIRST STRANGER Why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece Is every flatterers spirit Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish For in my knowing Timon has been this lords father And kept his credit with his purse Supported his estate nay Timons money Has paid his men their wages He neer drinks But Timons silver treads upon his lip And yetO see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape He does deny him in respect of his What charitable men afford to beggars THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it FIRST STRANGER For mine own part I never tasted Timon in my life Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend Yet I protest For his right noble mind illustrious virtue And honourable carriage Had his necessity made use of me I would have put my wealth into donation And the best half should have returned to him So much I love his heart But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense For policy sits above conscience Exeunt SCENE III The same A room in Sempronius house Enter a Third Servant of Timons with Sempronius another of Timons friends SEMPRONIUS Must he needs trouble me int Hum Bove all others He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus And now Ventidius is wealthy too Whom he redeemed from prison All these Owe their estates unto him SERVANT My lord They have all been touched and found base metal For they have all denied him SEMPRONIUS How Have they denied him Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me Three Humh It shows but little love or judgment in him Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians Thrive give him over Must I take th cure upon me Has much disgraced me int Im angry at him That might have known my place I see no sense fort But his occasions might have wooed me first For in my conscience I was the first man That eer received gift from him And does he think so backwardly of me now That Ill requite it last No So it may prove an argument of laughter To th rest and I mongst lords be thought a fool Id rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first but for my minds sake Id such a courage to do him good But now return And with their faint reply this answer join Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin Exit SERVANT Excellent Your lordships a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself byt and I cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his politic love This was my lords best hope now all are fled Save only the gods Now his friends are dead Doors that were neer acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employed Now to guard sure their master And this is all a liberal course allows Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house Exit SCENE IV A hall in Timons house Enter two of Varros Servants meeting Titus and Hortensius and then Lucius all Servants of Timons creditors to wait for his coming out FIRST VARROS SERVANT Well met good morrow Titus and Hortensius TITUS The like to you kind Varro HORTENSIUS Lucius What do we meet together

What do you think the hour PHILOTUS Labouring for nine LUCIUS So much PHILOTUS Is not my lord seen yet LUCIUS Not yet PHILOTUS I wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven LUCIUS Ay but the days are waxed shorter with him You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the suns but not like his recoverable I fear tis deepest winter in Lord Timons purse That is one may reach deep enough and yet Find little PHILOTUS I am of your fear for that TITUS Ill show you how t observe a strange event Your lord sends now for money HORTENSIUS Most true he does TITUS And he wears jewels now of Timons gift For which I wait for money HORTENSIUS It is against my heart LUCIUS Mark how strange it shows Timon in this should pay more than he owes And een as if your lord should wear rich jewels And send for money for em HORTENSIUS Im weary of this charge the gods can witness I know my lord hath spent of Timons wealth And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth FIRST VARROS SERVANT Yes mines three thousand crowns Whats yoursLUCIUS Five thousand mine FIRST VARROS SERVANT Tis much deep and it should seem by th sum Your masters confidence was above mine Else surely his had equalled Enter Flaminius TITUS One of Lord Timons men LUCIUS Flaminius Sir a word Pray is my lord ready to come forth FLAMINIUS No indeed he is not TITUS We attend his lordship pray signify so much FLAMINIUS I need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent Exit Flaminius Enter Flavius in a cloak muffled LUCIUS Ha is not that his steward muffled so He goes away in a cloud Call him call him TITUS Do you hear sir SECOND VARROS SERVANT By your leave sir FLAVIUS What do you ask of me my friend TITUS We wait for certain money here sir FLAVIUS Ay If money were as certain as your waiting Twere sure enough Why then preferred you not your sums and bills When your false masters eat of my lords meat Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down th interest into their gluttonous maws You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up Let me pass quietly Believet my lord and I have made an end I have no more to reckon he to spend LUCIUS Ay but this answer will not serve FLAVIUS If twill not serve tis not so base as you For you serve knaves Exit FIRST VARROS SERVANT How What does his cashiered worship mutter SECOND VARROS SERVANT No matter what hes poor and thats revenge enough Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in Such may rail against great buildings Enter Servilius TITUS O heres Servilius now we shall know some answer SERVILIUS If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much fromt For taket of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has forsook him hes much out of health and keeps his chamber LUCIUS Many do keep their chambers are not sick And if it be so far beyond his health Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts And make a clear way to the gods SERVILIUS Good gods TITUS We cannot take this for answer sir FLAMINIUS Within Servilius help My lord my lord Enter Timon in a rage TIMON What are my doors opposed against my passage Have I been ever free and must my house Be my retentive enemy my jail The place which I have feasted does it now Like all mankind show me an iron heart LUCIUS Put in now Titus TITUS My lord here is my bill LUCIUS Heres mine HORTENSIUS And mine my lord BOTH VARROS SERVANTS And ours my lord PHILOTUS All our bills TIMON Knock me down with em Cleave me to the girdle LUCIUS Alas my lord TIMON Cut my heart in sums TITUS Mine fifty talents TIMON Tell out my blood LUCIUS Five thousand crowns my lord TIMON Five thousand drops pays that What yours and yours FIRST VARROS SERVANT My lord SECOND VARROS SERVANT My lord TIMON Tear me take me and the gods fall upon you

friends again Lucius Lucullus and Sempronius all Ill once more feast the rascals FLAVIUS O my lord You only speak from your distracted soul There is not so much left to furnish out A moderate table TIMON Be it not in thy care Go I charge thee invite them all Let in the tide Of knaves once more My cook and Ill provide Exeunt SCENE V The same The senate house Enter three Senators at one door Alcibiades meeting them with Attendants FIRST SENATOR My lord you have my voice to t The faults Bloody Tis necessary he should die Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy SECOND SENATOR Most true the law shall bruise em ALCIBIADES Honour health and compassion to the senate FIRST SENATOR Now captain ALCIBIADES I am a humble suitor to your virtues For pity is the virtue of the law And none but tyrants use it cruelly It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood Hath stepped into the law which is past depth To those that without heed do plunge intot He is a man setting his fate aside Of comely virtues Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice An honour in him which buys out his fault But with a noble fury and fair spirit Seeing his reputation touched to death He did oppose his foe And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behave his anger ere twas spent As if he had but proved an argument FIRST SENATOR You undergo too strict a paradox Striving to make an ugly deed look fair Your words have took such pains as if they laboured To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling Upon the head of valour which indeed Is valour misbegot and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born Hes truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs His outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly And neer prefer his injuries to his heart To bring it into danger If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill What folly tis to hazard life for ill ALCIBIADES My lord FIRST SENATOR You cannot make gross sins look clear To revenge is no valour but to bear ALCIBIADES My lords then under favour pardon me If I speak like a captain Why do fond men expose themselves to battle And not endure all threats Sleep upont And let the foes quietly cut their throats Without repugnancy If there be Such valour in the bearing what make we Abroad Why then women are more valiant That stay at home if bearing carry it And the ass more captain than the lion the felon Loaden with irons wiser than the judge If wisdom be in suffering O my lords As you are great be pitifully good Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood To kill I grant is sins extremest gust But in defence by mercy tis most just To be in anger is impiety But who is man that is not angry Weigh but the crime with this SECOND SENATOR You breathe in vain ALCIBIADES In vain His service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life FIRST SENATOR Whats that ALCIBIADES Why I say my lords has done fair service And slain in fight many of your enemies How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict and made plenteous wounds SECOND SENATOR He has made too much plenty with em Hes a sworn rioter He has a sin That often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner If there were no foes that were enough To overcome him In that beastly fury He has been known to commit outrages And cherish factions Tis inferred to us His days are foul and his drink dangerous FIRST SENATOR He dies ALCIBIADES Hard fate He might have died in war My lords if not for any parts in him Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none yet more to move you Take my deserts to his and join em both And for I know your reverend ages love Security Ill pawn my victories all My honour to you upon his good returns If by this crime he owes the law his life Why let the war receivet in valiant gore For law is strict and war is nothing more FIRST SENATOR We are for law He dies Urge it no more On height of our displeasure Friend or brother He forfeits his own blood that spills another ALCIBIADES Must it be so It must not be My lords I do beseech you know me SECOND SENATOR How ALCIBIADES Call me to your remembrances THIRD SENATOR What ALCIBIADES I cannot think but your age has forgot me It could not else be I should prove so base To sue and be denied such common grace My wounds ache at you FIRST SENATOR Do you dare our anger Tis in few words but spacious in effect We banish thee for ever ALCIBIADES Banish me Banish your dotage banish usury That makes the Senate ugly FIRST SENATOR If after two days shine Athens contain thee Attend our weightier judgment And not to swell our spirit He shall be executed presently Exeunt Senators ALCIBIADES Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live Only in bone that none may look on you Im worse than mad I have kept back their foes While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest I myself Rich only in large hurts All those for this Is this the balsam that the usuring senate Pours into captains wounds Banishment It comes not ill I hate not to be banished It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury That I may strike at Athens Ill cheer up My discontented troops and lay for hearts Tis honour with most lands to be at odds Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods Exit SCENE VI A room of state in Timons house Music Enter divers Friends at several doors FIRST FRIEND The good time of day to you sir SECOND FRIEND I also wish it to you I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day FIRST FRIEND Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends SECOND FRIEND It should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting FIRST FRIEND I should think so He hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and I must needs appear SECOND FRIEND In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse I am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out FIRST FRIEND I am sick of that grief too as I understand how all things go SECOND FRIEND Every man heres so What would he have borrowed you FIRST FRIEND A thousand pieces SECOND FRIEND A thousand pieces FIRST FRIEND What of you SECOND FRIEND He sent to me sirhere he comes Enter Timon and Attendants TIMON With all my heart gentlemen both And how fare you FIRST FRIEND Ever at the best hearing well of your lordship SECOND FRIEND The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship TIMON Aside Nor more willingly leaves winter such summer birds are men Gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long stay Feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so harshly o th trumpets sound we shall tot presently FIRST FRIEND I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messenger TIMON O sir let it not trouble you SECOND FRIEND My noble lord TIMON Ah my good friend what cheer SECOND FRIEND My most honourable lord I am een sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggarTIMON Think not ont sir SECOND FRIEND If you had sent but two hours before TIMON Let it not cumber your better remembrance The banquet brought in Come bring in all together SECOND FRIEND All covered dishes FIRST FRIEND Royal cheer I warrant you THIRD FRIEND Doubt not that if money and the season can yield it FIRST FRIEND How do you Whats the news THIRD FRIEND Alcibiades is banished Hear you of it FIRST AND SECOND FRIENDS Alcibiades banished THIRD FRIEND Tis so be sure of it FIRST FRIEND How how SECOND FRIEND I pray you upon what TIMON My worthy friends will you draw near THIRD FRIEND Ill tell you more anon Heres a noble feast toward SECOND FRIEND This is the old man still THIRD FRIEND Willt hold willt hold SECOND FRIEND It does but time willand so THIRD FRIEND I do conceive TIMON Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress Your diet shall be in all places alike Make not a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place Sit sit The gods require our thanks You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness For your own gifts make yourselves praised but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised Lend to each man enough that one need not lend to another for were your godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains If there sit twelve women at the table let a dozen of them be as they are The rest of your foes O gods the senators of Athens together with the common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make suitable for destruction For these my present friends as they are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are they welcome Uncover dogs and lap The dishes are uncovered and prove to be full of lukewarm water SOME SPEAK What does his lordship mean SOME OTHER I know not TIMON May you a better feast never behold You knot of mouthfriends Smoke and lukewarm water Is your perfection This is Timons last Who stuck and spangled with your flatteries Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces Your reeking villainy Throws water in their faces Live loathed and long Most smiling smooth detested parasites Courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears You fools of fortune trencherfriends times flies Capandknee slaves vapours and minutejacks Of man and beast the infinite malady Crust you quite oer They stand What dost thou go Soft Take thy physic first thou too and thou Stay I will lend thee money borrow none He attacks them and forces them out What all in motion Henceforth be no feast Whereat a villains not a welcome guest Burn house Sink Athens Henceforth hated be Of Timon man and all humanity Exit Enter Timons Friends the Senators with other Lords FIRST FRIEND How now my lords SECOND FRIEND Know you the quality of Lord Timons fury THIRD FRIEND Push Did you see my cap FOURTH FRIEND I have lost my gown FIRST FRIEND Hes but a mad lord and nought but humours sways him He gave me a jewel th other day and now he has beat it out of my hat Did you see my jewel THIRD FRIEND Did you see my cap SECOND FRIEND Here tis FOURTH FRIEND Here lies my gown FIRST FRIEND Lets make no stay SECOND FRIEND Lord Timons mad THIRD FRIEND I feelt upon my bones FOURTH FRIEND One day he gives us diamonds next day stones Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I Without the walls of Athens Enter Timon TIMON Let me look back upon thee O thou wall That girdles in those wolves dive in the earth And fence not Athens Matrons turn incontinent Obedience fail in children Slaves and fools Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench And minister in their steads To general filths Convert o th instant green virginity Dot in your parents eyes Bankrupts hold fast Rather than render back out with your knives And cut your trusters throats Bound servants steal Largehanded robbers your grave masters are And pill by law Maid to thy masters bed Thy mistress is o th brothel Son of sixteen Pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire With it beat out his brains Piety and fear Religion to the gods peace justice truth Domestic awe nightrest and neighbourhood Instruction manners mysteries and trades Degrees observances customs and laws Decline to your confounding contraries And let confusion live Plagues incident to men Your potent and infectious fevers heap On Athens ripe for stroke Thou cold sciatica Cripple our senators that their limbs may halt As lamely as their manners Lust and liberty Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth That gainst the stream of virtue they may strive And drown themselves in riot Itches blains Sow all th Athenian bosoms and their crop Be general leprosy Breath infect breath That their society as their friendship may Be merely poison Nothing Ill bear from thee But nakedness thou detestable town Take thou that too with multiplying bans Timon will to the woods where he shall find Th unkindest beast more kinder than mankind The gods confoundhear me you good gods all Th Athenians both within and out that wall And grant as Timon grows his hate may grow To the whole race of mankind high and low Amen Exit SCENE II Athens A room in Timons house Enter Flavius with two or three Servants FIRST SERVANT Hear you Master Steward wheres our master Are we undone cast off nothing remaining FLAVIUS Alack my fellows what should I say to you Let me be recorded by the righteous gods I am as poor as you FIRST SERVANT Such a house broke So noble a master falln All gone and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm And go along with him SECOND SERVANT As we do turn our backs From our companion thrown into his grave So his familiars to his buried fortunes Slink all away leave their false vows with him Like empty purses picked and his poor self A dedicated beggar to the air With his disease of allshunned poverty Walks like contempt aloneMore of our fellows Enter other Servants FLAVIUS All broken implements of a ruined house THIRD SERVANT Yet do our hearts wear Timons livery That see I by our faces We are fellows still Serving alike in sorrow Leaked is our bark And we poor mates stand on the dying deck Hearing the surges threat We must all part Into this sea of air FLAVIUS Good fellows all The latest of my wealth Ill share amongst you Wherever we shall meet for Timons sake Lets yet be fellows Lets shake our heads and say As twere a knell unto our masters fortune We have seen better days Let each take some Offering them money Nay put out all your hands Not one word more Thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor They embrace and part several ways O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt Since riches point to misery and contempt Who would be so mocked with glory or to live But in a dream of friendship To have his pomp and all what state compounds But only painted like his varnished friends Poor honest lord brought low by his own heart Undone by goodness Strange unusual blood When mans worst sin is he does too much good Who then dares to be half so kind again For bounty that makes gods does still mar men My dearest lord blessed to be most accursed Rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes Are made thy chief afflictions Alas kind lord Hes flung in rage from this ingrateful seat Of monstrous friends Nor has he with him to supply his life Or that which can command it Ill follow and inquire him out Ill ever serve his mind with my best will Whilst I have gold Ill be his steward

conceptious womb Let it no more bring out ingrateful man Go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face Hath to the marbled mansion all above Never presented O a root dear thanks Dry up thy marrows vines and ploughtorn leas Whereof ingrateful man with liquorish draughts And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind That from it all consideration slips Enter Apemantus More man Plague plague APEMANTUS I was directed hither Men report Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them TIMON Tis then because thou dost not keep a dog Whom I would imitate

Thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft Hug their diseased perfumes and have forgot That ever Timon was Shame not these woods By putting on the cunning of a carper Be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive By that which has undone thee Hinge thy knee And let his very breath whom thoult observe Blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain And call it excellent Thou wast told thus Thou gavst thine ears like tapsters that bade welcome To knaves and all approachers Tis most just That thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again Rascals should havet Do not assume my likeness TIMON Were I like thee Id throw away myself APEMANTUS Thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself A madman so long now a fool What thinkst That the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain Will put thy shirt on warm Will these mossed trees That have outlived the eagle page thy heels And skip when thou pointst out Will the cold brook Candied with ice caudle thy morning taste To cure thy oernights surfeit Call

complete The other at high wish Best state contentless Hath a distracted and most wretched being Worse than the worst content Thou shouldst desire to die being miserable TIMON Not by his breath that is more miserable Thou art a slave whom Fortunes tender arm With favour never clasped but bred a dog Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded The sweet degrees that this brief world affords To such as may the passive drugs of it Freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself In general riot melted down thy youth In different beds of lust and never learned The icy precepts of respect but followed The sugared game before thee But myself Who had the world as my confectionary The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men At duty more than I could frame employment That numberless

loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio asin love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of

Exeunt SCENE III Leonatos Garden Enter Benedick BENEDICK Boy Enter a Boy BOY Signior BENEDICK In my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard BOY I am here already sir BENEDICK I know that but I would have thee hence and here again Exit Boy I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but Ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be thats certain wise or Ill none virtuous or Ill never cheapen her fair or Ill never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please God Ha the Prince and Monsieur Love I will hide me in the arbourWithdraws Enter Don Pedro Leonato and Claudio followed by Balthasar and Musicians DON PEDRO Come shall we hear this music CLAUDIO Yea my good lord How still the evening is As hushd on purpose to grace harmony DON PEDRO See you where Benedick hath hid himself CLAUDIO O very well my lord the music ended Well fit the kidfox with a pennyworth DON PEDRO Come Balthasar well hear that song again BALTHASAR O good my lord tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once DON PEDRO It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection I pray thee sing and let me woo no more BALTHASAR Because you talk of wooing I will sing Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes Yet will he swear he loves DON PEDRO Nay pray thee come Or if thou wilt hold longer argument Do it in notes BALTHASAR Note this before my notes Theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting DON PEDRO Why these are very crotchets that he speaks Notes notes forsooth and nothing Music BENEDICK Now divine air now is his soul ravished Is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies Well a horn for my money when alls done BALTHASAR sings Sigh no more ladies sigh no more Men were deceivers ever One foot in sea and one on shore To one thing constant never Then sigh not so but let them go And be you blithe and bonny Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny nonny Sing no more ditties sing no mo Of dumps so dull and heavy The fraud of men was ever so Since summer first was leavy Then sigh not so but let them go And be you blithe and bonny Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny nonny DON PEDRO By my troth a good song BALTHASAR And an ill singer my lord DON PEDRO Ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift BENEDICK Aside And he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief I had as lief have heard the nightraven come what plague could have come after it DON PEDRO Yea marry dost thou hear Balthasar I pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Heros chamber window BALTHASAR The best I can my lord DON PEDRO Do so farewell Exeunt Balthasar and Musicians Come hither Leonato what was it you told me of today that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick CLAUDIO O ayAside to Don Pedro Stalk on stalk on the fowl sits I did never think that lady would have loved any man LEONATO No nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor BENEDICK Aside Ist possible Sits the wind in that corner LEONATO By my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought DON PEDRO Maybe she doth but counterfeit CLAUDIO Faith like enough LEONATO O God counterfeit There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it DON PEDRO Why what effects of passion shows she CLAUDIO Aside Bait the hook well this fish will bite LEONATO What effects my lord She will sit you To Claudio You heard my daughter tell you how CLAUDIO She did indeed DON PEDRO How how I pray you You amaze me I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection LEONATO I would have sworn it had my lord especially against Benedick BENEDICK Aside I should think this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide itself in such reverence CLAUDIO Aside He hath taen the infection hold it up DON PEDRO Hath she made her affection known to Benedick LEONATO No and swears she never will thats her torment CLAUDIO Tis true indeed so your daughter says Shall I says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that I love him LEONATO This says she now when she is beginning to write to him for shell be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all CLAUDIO Now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of LEONATO O when she had writ it and was reading it over she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet CLAUDIO That LEONATO O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her I measure him says she by my own spirit for I should flout him if he writ to me yea though I love him I should CLAUDIO Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses O sweet Benedick God give me patience LEONATO She doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself It is very true DON PEDRO It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it CLAUDIO To what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse DON PEDRO And he should it were an alms to hang him Shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous CLAUDIO And she is exceeding wise DON PEDRO In everything but in loving Benedick LEONATO O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian DON PEDRO I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say LEONATO Were it good think you CLAUDIO Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness DON PEDRO She doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the manas you know allhath a contemptible spirit CLAUDIO He is a very proper man DON PEDRO He hath indeed a good outward happiness CLAUDIO Fore God and in my mind very wise DON PEDRO He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit CLAUDIO And I take him to be valiant DON PEDRO As Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear LEONATO If he do fear God a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling DON PEDRO And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love CLAUDIO Never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel LEONATO Nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first DON PEDRO Well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady LEONATO My lord will you walk dinner is ready CLAUDIO Aside If he do not dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectation DON PEDRO Aside Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry The sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumb show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Exeunt Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato BENEDICK Advancing from the arbour This can be no trick the conference was sadly borne They have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair tis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous tis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day shes a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her Enter Beatrice BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner BENEDICK Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful I would not have come BENEDICK You take pleasure then in the message BEATRICE Yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior fare you well Exit BENEDICK Ha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picture Exit ACT III SCENE I Leonatos Garden Enter Hero Margaret and Ursula HERO Good Margaret run thee to the parlour There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursala Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her say that thou overheardst us And bid her steal into the pleached bower Where honeysuckles ripend by the sun Forbid the sun to enter like favourites Made proud by princes that advance their pride Against that power that bred it There will she hide her To listen our propose This is thy office Bear thee well in it and leave us aloneMARGARET Ill make her come I warrant you presently Exit HERO Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come As we do trace this alley up and down Our talk must only be of Benedick When I do name him let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice of this matter Is little Cupids crafty arrow made That only wounds by hearsay Enter Beatrice behind Now begin For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground to hear our conference URSULA The pleasantst angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait So angle we for Beatrice who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture Fear you not my part of the dialogue HERO Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it They advance to the bower No truly Ursula she is too disdainful I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock URSULA But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely HERO So says the Prince and my newtrothed lord URSULA And did they bid you tell her of it madam HERO They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them if they lovd Benedick To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it URSULA Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon HERO O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man But Nature never framd a womans heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes Misprising what they look on and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so selfendeard URSULA Sure I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love lest she make sport at it HERO Why you speak truth I never yet saw man How wise how noble young how rarely featurd But she would spell him backward if fairfacd She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black why Nature drawing of an antick Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded If low an agate very vilely cut If speaking why a vane blown with all winds If silent why a block moved with none So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth URSULA Sure sure such carping is not commendable HERO No not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is cannot be commendable But who dare tell her so If I should speak She would mock me into air O she would laugh me Out of myself press me to death with wit Therefore let Benedick like coverd fire Consume away in sighs waste inwardly It were a better death than die with mocks Which is as bad as die with tickling URSULA Yet tell her of it hear what she will say HERO No rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And truly Ill devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking URSULA O do not do your cousin such a wrong She cannot be so much without true judgment Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prizd to haveas to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick HERO He is the only man of Italy Always excepted my dear Claudio URSULA I pray you be not angry with me madam Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick For shape for bearing argument and valour Goes foremost in report through Italy HERO Indeed he hath an excellent good name URSULA His excellence did earn it ere he had it When are you married madam HERO Why every day tomorrow Come go in Ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow URSULA Shes limd I warrant you We have caught her madam HERO If it prove so then loving goes by haps Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps Exeunt Hero and Ursula BEATRICE Advancing What fire is in mine ears Can this be true Stand I condemnd for pride and scorn so much Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu No glory lives behind the back of such And Benedick love on I will requite thee Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band For others say thou dost deserve and I Believe it better than reportingly Exit SCENE II A Room in Leonatos House Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick and Leonato DON PEDRO I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Arragon CLAUDIO Ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me DON PEDRO Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks BENEDICK Gallants I am not as I have been LEONATO So say I methinks you are sadder CLAUDIO I hope he be in love DON PEDRO Hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love If he be sad he wants money BENEDICK I have the toothache DON PEDRO Draw it BENEDICK Hang it CLAUDIO You must hang it first and draw it afterwards DON PEDRO What sigh for the toothache LEONATO Where is but a humour or a worm BENEDICK Well everyone can master a grief but he that has it CLAUDIO Yet say I he is in love DON PEDRO There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman today a Frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is CLAUDIO If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode DON PEDRO Hath any man seen him at the barbers CLAUDIO No but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls LEONATO Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard DON PEDRO Nay a rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that CLAUDIO Thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love DON PEDRO The greatest note of it is his melancholy CLAUDIO And when was he wont to wash his face DON PEDRO Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say of him CLAUDIO Nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now governed by stops DON PEDRO Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude he is in love CLAUDIO Nay but I know who loves him DON PEDRO That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not CLAUDIO Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him DON PEDRO She shall be buried with her face upwards BENEDICK Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old signior walk aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobbyhorses must not hear Exeunt Benedick and Leonato DON PEDRO For my life to break with him about Beatrice CLAUDIO Tis even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet Enter Don John DON JOHN My lord and brother God save you DON PEDRO Good den brother DON JOHN If your leisure served I would speak with you DON PEDRO In private DON JOHN If it please you yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns him DON PEDRO Whats the matter DON JOHN To Claudio Means your lordship to be married tomorrow DON PEDRO You know he does DON JOHN I know not that when he knows what I know CLAUDIO If there be any impediment I pray you discover it DON JOHN You may think I love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother I think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit illspent and labour ill bestowed DON PEDRO Why whats the matter DON JOHN I came hither to tell you and circumstances shortenedfor she has been too long a talking ofthe lady is disloyal CLAUDIO Who Hero DON JOHN Even she Leonatos Hero your Hero every mans Hero CLAUDIO Disloyal DON JOHN The words too good to paint out her wickedness I could say she were worse think you of a worse title and I will fit her to it Wonder not till further warrant go but with me tonight you shall see her chamber window entered even the night before her weddingday if you love her then tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind CLAUDIO May this be so DON PEDRO I will not think it DON JOHN If you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know If you will follow me I will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly CLAUDIO If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed there will I shame her DON PEDRO And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with thee to disgrace her DON JOHN I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself DON PEDRO O day untowardly turned CLAUDIO O mischief strangely thwarting DON JOHN O plague right well prevented So will you say when you have seen the sequel Exeunt Scene III A Street Enter Dogberry and

write and read comes by Nature SECOND WATCH Both which Master Constable DOGBERRY You have I knew it would be your answer Well for your favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn This is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the Princes nameSECOND WATCH How if a will not stand DOGBERRY Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave VERGES If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the Princes subjects DOGBERRY True and they are to meddle with none but the Princes subjects You shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured SECOND WATCH We will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch DOGBERRY Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen Well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed SECOND WATCH How if they will not DOGBERRY Why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for SECOND WATCH Well sir DOGBERRY If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty SECOND WATCH If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him DOGBERRY Truly by your office you may but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled The most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company VERGES You have been always called a merciful man partner DOGBERRY Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him VERGES If you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it SECOND WATCH How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us DOGBERRY Why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats VERGES Tis very true DOGBERRY This is the end of the charge You constable are to present the Princes own person if you meet the Prince in the night you may stay him VERGES Nay byr lady that I think a cannot DOGBERRY Five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the Prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will VERGES Byr lady I think it be so DOGBERRY Ha ah ha Well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows counsels and your own and good night Come neighbour SECOND WATCH Well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the church bench till two and then all to bed DOGBERRY One word

WATCH Aside Some treason masters yet stand close BORACHIO Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats CONRADE Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear BORACHIO Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will CONRADE I wonder at it BORACHIO That shows thou art unconfirmed Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man CONRADE Yes it is apparel BORACHIO I mean the fashion CONRADE Yes the fashion is the fashion BORACHIO

gentleman I remember his name BORACHIO Didst thou not hear somebody CONRADE No twas the vane on the house BORACHIO Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty sometime fashioning them like Pharaohs soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god Bels priests in the old church window sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club CONRADE All this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion BORACHIO Not so neither but know that I have tonight wooed Margaret the Lady Heros gentlewoman by the name of Hero she leans me out at her mistress chamber window bids me a thousand times good nightI tell this tale vilelyI should first tell thee how the Prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter CONRADE And thought they Margaret was Hero BORACHIO Two of them did the Prince and Claudio but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villainy which did confirm any slander that Don John had made away went Claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw oer night and send her home again without a husband FIRST WATCH We charge you in the Princes name stand SECOND WATCH Call up the right Master Constable We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth FIRST WATCH And one Deformed is one of them I know him a wears a lock CONRADE Masters masters SECOND WATCH Youll be made bring Deformed forth I warrant you CONRADE
