daughters heart Turnd her obedience which is due to me To stubborn harshness And my gracious Duke Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius I beg the ancient privilege of Athens As she is mine I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Immediately provided in that case THESEUS What say you Hermia Be advisd fair maid To you your father should be as a god One that composd your beauties yea and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it Demetrius is a worthy gentleman HERMIA So is Lysander THESEUS In himself he is But in this kind wanting your fathers voice The other must be held the worthier HERMIA I would my father lookd but with my eyes THESEUS Rather your eyes must with his judgment look HERMIA I do entreat your Grace to pardon me I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts But I beseech your Grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case If I refuse to wed Demetrius THESEUS Either to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men Therefore fair Hermia question your desires Know of your youth examine well your blood Whether if you yield not to your fathers choice You can endure the livery of a nun For aye to be in shady cloister mewd To live a barren sister all your life Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon Thriceblessd they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage But earthlier happy is the rose distilld Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows lives and dies in single blessedness HERMIA So will I grow so live so die my lord Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship whose unwishd yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty THESEUS Take time to pause and by the next new moon The sealingday betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your fathers will Or else to wed Demetrius as he would Or on Dianas altar to protest For aye austerity and single life DEMETRIUS Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield Thy crazd title to my certain right LYSANDER You have her fathers love Demetrius Let me have Hermias Do you marry him EGEUS Scornful Lysander true he hath my love And what is mine my love shall render him And she is mine and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius LYSANDER I am my lord as well derivd as he As well possessd my love is more than his My fortunes every way as fairly rankd If not with vantage as Demetrius And which is more than all these boasts can be I am belovd of beauteous Hermia Why should not I then prosecute my right Demetrius Ill avouch it to his head Made love to Nedars daughter Helena And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry Upon this spotted and inconstant man THESEUS I must confess that I have heard so much And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof But being overfull of selfaffairs My mind did lose itBut Demetrius come And come Egeus you shall go with me I have some private schooling for you both For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your fathers will Or else the law of Athens yields you up Which by no means we may extenuate To death or to a vow of single life Come my Hippolyta What cheer my love Demetrius and Egeus go along I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves EGEUS With duty and desire we follow you Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia LYSANDER How now my love Why is your cheek so pale How chance the roses there do fade so fast HERMIA Belike for want of rain which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes LYSANDER Ay me For aught that I could ever read Could ever hear by tale or history The course of true love never did run smooth But either it was different in blood HERMIA O cross Too high to be enthralld to low LYSANDER Or else misgraffd in respect of years HERMIA O spite Too old to be engagd to young LYSANDER Or else it stood upon the choice of friends HERMIA O hell to choose love by anothers eyes LYSANDER Or if there were a sympathy in choice War death or sickness did lay siege to it Making it momentany as a sound Swift as a shadow short as any dream Brief as the lightning in the collied night That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth And ere a man hath power to say Behold The jaws of darkness do devour it up So quick bright things come to confusion HERMIA If then true lovers have ever crossd It stands as an edict in destiny Then let us teach our trial patience Because it is a customary cross As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs Wishes and tears poor fancys followers LYSANDER A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia I have a widow aunt a dowager Of great revenue and she hath no child From Athens is her house remote seven leagues And she respects me as her only son There gentle Hermia may I marry thee And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then Steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night And in the wood a league without the town Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May There will I stay for thee HERMIA My good Lysander I swear to thee by Cupids strongest bow By his best arrow with the golden head By the simplicity of Venus doves By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves And by that fire which burnd the Carthage queen When the false Trojan under sail was seen By all the vows that ever men have broke In number more than ever women spoke In that same place thou hast appointed me Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee LYSANDER Keep promise love Look here comes Helena Enter Helena HERMIA God speed fair Helena Whither away HELENA Call you me fair That fair again unsay Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair Your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherds ear When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear Sickness is catching O were"

Thus I would teach a dog I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master and I came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg O tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hanged fort sure as I live he had suffered fort You shall judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four

messenger To plead for that which I would not obtain To carry that which I would have refused To praise his faith which I would have dispraised I am my masters true confirmed love But cannot be true

his false finger have profaned the ring Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong JULIA She thanks you SILVIA What sayst thou JULIA I thank you madam that you tender her Poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much SILVIA Dost thou know her JULIA Almost as well as I do know myself To think upon her woes I do protest That I have wept a hundred several times SILVIA Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her JULIA I think she doth and thats her cause of sorrow SILVIA Is she not passing fairJULIA She hath been fairer madam than she is When she did think my master loved her well She in my judgement was as fair as you But since she did neglect her lookingglass And threw her sunexpelling mask away The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks And pinched the lilytincture of her face That now she is become as black as I SILVIA How tall was she JULIA About my stature for at Pentecost When all our pageants of delight were played Our youth got me to play the womans part And I was trimmed in Madam Julias gown Which served me as fit by all mens judgements As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height And at that time I made her weep agood For I did play a lamentable part Madam twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress moved therewithal Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow SILVIA She is beholding to thee gentle youth Alas poor lady desolate and left I weep myself to think upon thy words Here youth there is my purse I give thee this For thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovst her Farewell JULIA And she shall thank you fort if eer you know her Exeunt Silvia and Attendants A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful I hope my masters suit will be but cold Since she respects my mistress love so much Alas how love can trifle with itself Here is her picture let me see I think If I had such a tire this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flattered her a little Unless I flatter with myself too much Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love Ill get me such a coloured periwig Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine Ay but her foreheads low and mines as high What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come shadow come and take this shadow up For tis thy rival O thou senseless form Thou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored And were there sense in his idolatry My substance should be statue in thy stead Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake That used me so or else by Jove I vow I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee Exit ACT V SCENE I Milan An abbey Enter Eglamour EGLAMOUR The sun begins to gild the western sky And now it is about the very hour That Silvia at Friar Patricks cell

of love and peace JULIA Aside But better indeed when you hold your peace THURIO What says she to my valour PROTEUS O sir she makes no doubt of that JULIA Aside She needs not when she knows it cowardice THURIO What says she to my birth PROTEUS That you are well derived JULIA Aside True from a gentleman to a fool THURIO Considers she my possessions PROTEUS O ay and pities them THURIO

late THURIO Not I PROTEUS Nor I DUKE Saw you my daughter PROTEUS Neither DUKE Why then shes fled unto that peasant Valentine And Eglamour is in her company Tis true for Friar Lawrence met them both As he in penance wandered through the forest Him he knew well and guessed that it was she But being masked he was not sure of it Besides she did intend confession At Patricks cell this even and there she was not These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse But mount you presently and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads toward Mantua whither they are fled Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me Exit THURIO Why this it is to be a peevish girl That flies her fortune when it follows her Ill after more to be revenged on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Silvia Exit PROTEUS And I will follow more for Silvias love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her Exit JULIA And I will follow more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love Exit SCENE III Frontiers of Mantua The forest Enter Silvia and Outlaws FIRST OUTLAW Come come be patient We must bring you to our captain SILVIA A thousand more mischances

forest Enter Valentine VALENTINE How use doth breed a habit in a man This shadowy desert unfrequented woods I better brook than flourishing peopled towns Here can I sit alone unseen of any And to the nightingales complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes O thou that dost inhabit in my breast Leave not the mansion so long tenantless Lest growing ruinous the building fall And leave no memory of what it was Repair me with thy presence Silvia Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain Shouts within What hallowing and what stir is this today These are my mates that make their wills

stood it next to death Would I not undergo for one calm look O tis the curse in love and still approved When women cannot love where theyre beloved SILVIA When Proteus cannot love where hes beloved Read over Julias heart thy first best love For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths Descended into perjury to love me Thou hast no faith left now

thats without faith or love For such is a friend now Treacherous man Thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me Who should be trusted when ones right hand Is perjured to the bosom Proteus I am sorry I must never trust thee more But count the world a stranger for thy sake The private wound is deepest O time most accurst Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst PROTEUS My shame and guilt confounds me Forgive me Valentine if hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence I tender t here I do as truly suffer As eer I did commit VALENTINE Then I am paid And once again I do receive thee honest Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased By penitence

thy oaths And entertained em deeply in her heart How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root O Proteus let this habit make thee blush Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment if shame live In a disguise of love It is the lesser blot modesty finds Women to change their shapes than men their minds PROTEUS Than men their minds Tis true O heaven were man But constant he were perfect That one error Fills him with faults makes him run through all th sins Inconstancy falls off ere it begins What is in Silvias face but I may spy More fresh in Julias with a constant eye VALENTINE Come come a hand from either Let me be blest to make this happy close Twere pity two such friends should be long foes PROTEUS Bear witness heaven I have my wish for ever JULIA And I mine

Rosaline Katharine and Maria PRINCESS Sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart If fairings come thus plentifully in A lady walled about with diamonds Look you what I have from the loving King ROSALINE Madam came nothing else along with that PRINCESS Nothing but this Yes as much love in rhyme As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper Writ o both sides the leaf margent and all That he was fain to seal on Cupids name ROSALINE That was the way to make his godhead wax For he hath been five thousand years a boy KATHARINE Ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too ROSALINE Youll neer be friends with him He killed your sister KATHARINE He made her melancholy sad and heavy And so she died Had she been light like you Of such a merry nimble stirring spirit She might ha been a grandam ere she died And so may you for a light heart lives long ROSALINE Whats your dark meaning mouse of this light word KATHARINE A light condition in a beauty dark ROSALINE We need more light to find your meaning out KATHARINE Youll mar the light by taking it in snuff Therefore Ill darkly end the argument ROSALINE Look what you do you do it still i th dark KATHARINE So do not you for you are a light wench

wit well played But Rosaline you have a favour too Who sent it And what is it ROSALINE I would you knew An if my face were but as fair as yours My favour were as great Be witness this Nay I have verses too I thank Berowne The numbers true and were the numbering too I were the fairest goddess on the ground I am compared to twenty thousand fairs O he hath drawn my picture in his letter PRINCESS Anything like ROSALINE Much in the letters nothing in the praise PRINCESS Beauteous as ink a good conclusion KATHARINE Fair as a text B in a copybook ROSALINE Ware pencils how Let me not die your debtor My red dominical my golden letter O that your face were not so full of Os PRINCESS A pox of that jest And beshrew all shrews But Katharine what was sent to you from fair Dumaine KATHARINE Madam

hands might never part PRINCESS We are wise girls to mock our lovers so ROSALINE They are worse fools to purchase mocking so That same Berowne Ill torture ere I go O that I knew he were but in by th

make me proud that jests So pairtauntlike would I oersway his state That he should be my fool and I his fate PRINCESS None are so surely caught when they are catched As wit turned fool Folly in wisdom

fools bears not so strong a note As foolry in the wise when wit doth dote Since all the power thereof it doth apply To prove by wit worth in simplicity Enter Boyet PRINCESS Here comes Boyet and mirth is in his face BOYET O I am stabbed with laughter Wheres her Grace PRINCESS Thy news Boyet BOYET Prepare madam prepare Arm wenches arm Encounters mounted are Against your peace Love doth approach

their breath against us Say scout say BOYET Under the cool shade of a sycamore I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour When lo to interrupt my purposed rest Toward that shade I might behold addressed The King and his companions Warily I stole into a neighbour thicket by And overheard what you shall overhear That by and by disguised they will be here Their herald is a pretty knavish page That well by heart hath conned his embassage Action and accent did they teach him there Thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear And ever and anon they made a doubt Presence majestical would put him out For quoth the King an angel shalt thou see Yet fear not thou but speak audaciously The boy replied An angel is not evil I should have feared her had she been a devil With that all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder Making the bold wag by their praises bolder One rubbed his elbow thus and fleered and swore A better speech was never spoke before Another with his finger and his thumb Cried Via we will do t come what will come The third he capered and cried All goes well The fourth turned on the toe and down he fell With that they all did tumble on the ground With such a zealous laughter so profound That in this spleen ridiculous appears To check their folly passions solemn tears PRINCESS But what but what come they to visit us BOYET They do they do and are apparelled thus Like Muscovites or Russians as I guess Their purpose is to parley court and dance And every one his lovefeat will advance Unto his several mistress which theyll know By favours several which they did bestow PRINCESS And will they so The gallants shall be tasked For ladies we will every one be masked And not a man of them shall have the grace Despite of suit to see a ladys face Hold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wear And then the King will court thee for his dear Hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline And change you favours too so shall your loves Woo contrary deceived by these removes ROSALINE Come on then wear the favours most in sight KATHARINE But in this changing what is your intent PRINCESS The effect of my intent is to cross theirs They do it but in mocking merriment And mock for mock is only my intent Their several counsels they unbosom shall To loves mistook and so be mocked withal Upon the next occasion that we meet With visages displayed to talk and greet ROSALINE But shall we dance if they desire us tot PRINCESS No to the death we will not move a foot Nor to their penned speech render we no grace But while tis spoke each turn away her face BOYET Why that contempt will kill the speakers heart And quite divorce his memory from his part PRINCESS Therefore I do it and I make no doubt The rest will neer come in if he be out Theres no such sport as sport by sport oerthrown To make theirs ours and ours none but our own So shall we stay mocking intended game And they well mocked depart away with shame Sound trumpet within BOYET The trumpet sounds Be masked the maskers come The Ladies mask Enter Blackamoors with music Moth with a speech the King Berowne Longaville and Dumaine disguised MOTH All hail the richest

purposes Know what they would BOYET What would you with the Princess BEROWNE Nothing but peace and gentle visitation ROSALINE What would they say they BOYET Nothing but peace and gentle visitation ROSALINE Why that they have and bid them so be gone BOYET She says you have it and you may be gone KING Say to her we have measured many miles To tread a measure with her on this grass BOYET They say that they have measured many a mile To tread a measure with you on this grass ROSALINE It is not so Ask them how many inches Is in one mile If they have measured many The measure then of one is easily told BOYET If to come hither you have measured miles And many miles the Princess bids you tell How many inches doth fill up one mile BEROWNE Tell her we measure them by weary steps BOYET She hears herself ROSALINE How many weary steps Of many weary miles you have oergone Are numbered in the travel of one mile BEROWNE We number nothing that we spend for you Our duty is so rich so infinite That we may do it still without account Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face That we like savages may worship it ROSALINE My face is but a moon and clouded too KING Blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do Vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine Those clouds removed upon our watery eyne ROSALINE O vain petitioner Beg a greater matter Thou now requests but moonshine in the water KING Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change Thou biddst me beg this begging is not strange ROSALINE Play music then Nay you must do it soon Music plays Not yet No dance Thus change I like the moon

break off break off BEROWNE By heaven all drybeaten with pure scoff KING Farewell mad wenches You have simple wits Exeunt King Lords and Blackamoors PRINCESS Twenty adieus my frozen Muscovites Are

Lord doth know Have not the grace to grace it with such show This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve Had he been Adam he had tempted Eve He can carve too and lisp Why this is he That kissed his hand away in courtesy This is the ape of form Monsieur the Nice That when he plays at tables chides the dice In honourable terms Nay he can sing A mean most meanly and in ushering Mend him who can The ladies call him sweet The stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet This is the flower that smiles on everyone To show his teeth as white as whales bone And consciences that will not die in debt Pay

It is not so my lord My lady to the manner of the days In courtesy gives undeserving praise We four indeed confronted were with four In Russian habit Here they stayed an hour And talked apace and in that hour my lord They did not bless us with one happy word I dare not call them fools but this I think When they are thirsty fools would fain have drink BEROWNE This jest is dry to me My gentle sweet Your wit makes wise things foolish When we greet With eyes best seeing heavens fiery eye By light we lose light Your capacity Is of that nature that to your huge store Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor ROSALINE This proves you wise and rich for in my eye BEROWNE I am a fool and full of poverty ROSALINE But that you take what doth to you belong It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue BEROWNE O I am yours and all that I possess ROSALINE All the fool mine BEROWNE I cannot give you less ROSALINE Which of the visors was it that you wore BEROWNE Where when what visor Why demand you this ROSALINE There then that visor that superfluous case That hid the worse and showed the better face KING We are descried Theyll mock us now downrightDUMAINE Let us confess and turn it

perjury Can any face of brass hold longer out Here stand I lady dart thy skill at me Bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit And I will wish thee never more to dance Nor never more in Russian habit wait O never will I trust to speeches penned Nor to the motion of a schoolboys tongue Nor never come in visor to my friend Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harpers song Taffeta phrases silken terms precise Threepiled hyperboles spruce affectation Figures pedantical these summer flies Have blown me full of maggot ostentation I do forswear them and I here protest By this white glovehow white the hand God knows Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed In russet yeas and honest kersey noes And to begin wench so God help me law My love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw ROSALINE Sans sans I pray you BEROWNE Yet I have a trick Of the old rage Bear with me I am sick Ill leave it by degrees Soft let us see

quench the fire of love with words LUCETTA I do not seek to quench your loves hot fire But qualify the fires extreme rage Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason JULIA The more thou dammst it up the more it burns The current that with gentle murmur glides Thou knowst being stopped impatiently doth rage But when his fair course is not hindered He makes sweet music with th enamelled stones Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage And so by many winding nooks he strays With willing sport to the wild ocean Then let me go and hinder not my course Ill be as patient as a gentle stream And make a pastime of each weary step Till the last step have brought me to my love And there Ill rest as after much turmoil A blessed soul doth in Elysium LUCETTA But in

journey All that is mine I leave at thy dispose My goods my lands my reputation Only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence Come answer not but to it presently I am impatient of my tarriance Exeunt ACT III SCENE I Milan An anteroom in the Dukes palace Enter Duke Thurio and Proteus DUKE Sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile We have some secrets to confer about Exit Thurio Now tell me Proteus whats your will with me PROTEUS My gracious lord that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me undeserving as I am My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend This night intends to steal away your daughter Myself am one made privy to the plot I know you have determined to bestow her On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates And should she thus be stoln away from you It would be much vexation to your age Thus for my dutys sake I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than by concealing it heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down Being unprevented to your timeless grave DUKE Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care Which to requite command me while I live This love of theirs myself have often seen Haply when they have judged me fast asleep And oftentimes have purposed to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so unworthily disgrace the man A rashness that I ever yet have shunned I gave him gentle looks thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosed to me And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested I nightly lodge her in an upper tower The key whereof myself have ever kept And thence she cannot be conveyed away PROTEUS Know noble lord they have devised a mean How he her chamberwindow will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down For which the youthful lover now is gone And this way comes he with it presently Where if it please you you may intercept him But good my lord do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at For love of you not hate unto my friend Hath made me publisher of this pretence DUKE Upon mine honour he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this PROTEUS Adieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming Exit Enter Valentine DUKE Sir Valentine whither away so fast VALENTINE Please it your Grace there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends And I am going to deliver them DUKE Be they of much import VALENTINE The tenor of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court DUKE Nay then no matter Stay with me awhile I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near wherein thou must be secret Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter VALENTINE I know it well my lord and sure the match Were rich and honourable Besides the gentleman Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter Cannot your grace win her to fancy him DUKE No trust me she is peevish sullen froward Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty Neither regarding that she is my child Nor fearing me as if I were her father And may I say to thee this pride of hers Upon advice hath drawn my love from her And where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherished by her childlike duty I now am full resolved to take a wife And turn her out to who will take her in Then let her beauty be her wedding dower For me and my possessions she esteems not VALENTINE What would your Grace have me to do in this DUKE There is a lady of Verona here Whom I affect but she is nice and coy And nought esteems my aged eloquence Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor For long agone I have forgot to court Besides the fashion of the time is changed How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sunbright eye VALENTINE Win her with gifts if she respect not words Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a womans mind DUKE But she did scorn a present that I sent her VALENTINE A woman sometime scorns what best contents her Send her another never give her oer For scorn at first makes afterlove the more If she do frown tis not in hate of you But rather to beget more love in you If she do chide tis not to have you gone Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone Take no repulse whatever she doth say For Get you gone she doth not mean Away Flatter and praise commend extol their graces Though neer so black say they have angels faces That man that hath a tongue I say is no man If with his tongue he cannot win a woman DUKE But she I mean is promised by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth And kept severely from resort of men That no man hath access by day to her VALENTINE Why then I would resort to her by night DUKE Ay but the doors be locked and keys kept safe That no man hath recourse to her by night VALENTINE What lets but one may enter at her window DUKE Her chamber is aloft far from the ground And built so shelving that one cannot climb it Without apparent hazard of his life VALENTINE Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks Would serve to scale another Heros tower So bold Leander would adventure it DUKE Now as thou art a gentleman of blood Advise me where I may have such a ladder VALENTINE When would you use it Pray sir tell me that DUKE This very night for Love is like a child That longs for everything that he can come by VALENTINE By seven oclock Ill get you such a ladder DUKE But hark thee I will go to her alone How shall I best convey the ladder thither VALENTINE It will be light my lord that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length DUKE A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn VALENTINE Ay my good lord DUKE Then let me see thy cloak Ill get me one of such another length VALENTINE Why any cloak will serve the turn my lordDUKE How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me Takes Valentines cloak and finds a letter and a rope ladder concealed under it What letter is this same Whats hereTo Silvia And here an engine fit for my proceeding Ill be so bold to break the seal for once Reads My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly And slaves they are to me that send them flying O could their master come and go as lightly Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them While I their king that thither them importune Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them Because myself do want my servants fortune I curse myself for they are sent by me That they should harbour where their lord should be Whats here Reads Silvia this night I will enfranchise thee Tis so and heres the ladder for the purpose Why Phathonfor thou art Merops son Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car And with thy daring folly burn the world Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee Go base intruder overweening slave Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates And think my patience more than thy desert Is privilege for thy departure hence Thank me for this more than for all the favours Which all too much I have bestowed on thee But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court By heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever bore my daughter or thyself Begone I will not hear thy vain excuse But as thou lovst thy life make speed from hence Exit VALENTINE And why not death rather than living torment To die is to be banished from myself And Silvia is myself banished from her Is self from selfa deadly banishment What light is light if Silvia be not seen What joy is joy if Silvia be not by Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection Except I be by Silvia in the night There is no music in the nightingale Unless I look on Silvia in the day There is no day for me to look upon She is my essence and I leave to be If I be not by her fair influence Fostered illumined cherished kept alive I fly not death to fly his deadly doom Tarry I here I but attend on death But fly I hence I fly away from life Enter Proteus and Lance PROTEUS Run boy run run seek him out LANCE

forsworn me What is your news LANCE Sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished PROTEUS That thou art banishedO thats the news From hence from Silvia and from me thy friend VALENTINE O I have fed upon this woe already And now excess of it will make me surfeit Doth Silvia know that I am banished PROTEUS Ay ay and she hath offered to the doom Which unreversed stands in effectual force A sea of melting pearl which some call tears Those at her fathers churlish feet she tendered With them upon her knees her humble self Wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe But neither bended knees pure hands held up Sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire But Valentine if he be taen must die Besides her intercession chafed him so When she for thy repeal was suppliant That to close prison he commanded her With many bitter threats of biding there VALENTINE No more unless the next word that thou speakst Have some malignant power upon my life If so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear As ending anthem of my endless dolour PROTEUS Cease to lament for that thou canst not help And study help for that which thou lamentst Time is the nurse and breeder of all good Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love Besides thy staying will abridge thy life Hope is a lovers staff walk hence with that And manage it against despairing thoughts Thy letters may be here though thou art hence Which being writ to me shall be delivered Even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love The time now serves not to expostulate

I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point And thus far clear him Now what moved me tot I will be bold with time and your attention Then mark th inducement Thus it came give heed tot My conscience first received a tenderness Scruple and prick on certain speeches uttered By th Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador Who had been hither sent on the debating A marriage twixt the Duke of Orleans and Our daughter Mary I th progress of this business Ere a determinate resolution he I mean the Bishop did require a respite Wherein he might the King his lord advertise Whether our daughter were legitimate Respecting this our marriage with the dowager Sometimes our brothers wife This respite shook The bosom of my conscience entered me Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble The region of my breast which forced such way That many mazed considerings did throng And pressed in with this caution First methought I stood not in the smile of heaven who had Commanded nature that my ladys womb If it conceived a male child by me should Do no more offices of life tot than The grave does to th dead for her male issue Or died where they were made or shortly after This world had aired them Hence I took a thoughtThis was a judgement on me that my kingdom Well worthy the best heir o th world should not Be gladded int by me Then follows that I weighed the danger which my realms stood in By this my issues fail and that gave to me Many a groaning throe Thus hulling in The wild sea of my conscience I did steer Toward this remedy whereupon we are Now present here together Thats to say I meant to rectify my conscience which I then did feel full sick and yet not well By all the reverend fathers of the land And doctors learned First I began in private With you my Lord of Lincoln You remember How under my oppression I did reek When I first moved you LINCOLN Very well my liege KING I have spoke long Be pleased yourself to say How far you satisfied me LINCOLN So please your Highness

consent proceeded Under your hands and seals Therefore go on For no dislike i th world against the person Of the good queen but the sharp thorny points Of my alleged reasons drives this forward Prove but our marriage lawful by my life And kingly dignity we are contented To wear our mortal state to come with her Katherine our Queen before the primest creature Thats paragoned o th world CAMPEIUS So please your Highness The Queen being absent tis a needful fitness That we adjourn this court till further day Meanwhile must be an earnest motion Made to the Queen to call back her appeal She intends

lord thy life thy keeper Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land To watch the night in storms the day in cold Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love fair looks and true obedience Too little payment for so great a debt Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord I am ashamd that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toil and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts Come come you froward and unable worms My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot And place your hands below your husbands foot In token of which duty if he please My hand is ready may it do him ease PETRUCHIO Why theres a wench Come on and kiss me Kate LUCENTIO Well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt hat VINCENTIO Tis a good hearing when children are toward LUCENTIO But a harsh hearing when women are froward PETRUCHIO Come Kate well to bed We three are married but you two are sped Twas I won the wager To Lucentio though you hit the white And being a winner God give you good night

heardst cry which thou sawst sink Sit down For thou must now know farther MIRANDA You have often Begun to tell me what I am but stoppd And left me to a bootless inquisition Concluding Stay not yet

exact like one Who having into truth by telling of it Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie he did believe He was indeed the Duke out o the substitution And executing th outward face

roard to us to sigh To th winds whose pity sighing back again Did us but loving wrong MIRANDA Alack what trouble Was I then to you PROSPERO O a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile

Theres a divinity that shapes our ends Roughhew them how we will HORATIO That is most certain HAMLET Up from my cabin My seagown scarfd about me in the dark Gropd I to find out them had my desire Fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew To mine own room again making so bold My fears forgetting manners to unseal Their grand commission where I found Horatio Oh royal knavery an exact command Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmarks health and Englands too With ho such bugs and goblins in my life That on the supervise no leisure bated No not to stay the grinding of the axe My head should be struck off HORATIO Ist possible HAMLET Heres the commission read it at more leisure But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed HORATIO I beseech you HAMLET Being thus benetted round with villanies Or I could make a prologue to my brains They had begun the playI sat me down Devisd a new commission wrote it fair I once did hold it as our statists do A baseness to write fair and labourd much How to forget that learning but sir now It did me yeomans service Wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote HORATIO Ay good my lord HAMLET An earnest conjuration from the King As England was his faithful tributary As love between them like the palm might flourish As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma tween their amities And many suchlike ases of great charge That on the view and know of these contents Without debatement further more or less He should the bearers put to sudden death Not shrivingtime allowd HORATIO How was this seald HAMLET Why even in that was heaven ordinant I had my fathers signet in my purse Which was the model of that Danish seal Folded the writ up in the form of the other Subscribd it gavet thimpression placd it safely The changeling never known Now the next day Was our seafight and what to this was sequent Thou knowst already HORATIO So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go tot HAMLET Why man they did make love to this employment They are not near my conscience their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites HORATIO Why what a king is this HAMLET Does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon He that hath killd my king and whord my mother Poppd in between thelection and my hopes Thrown out his angle for my proper life And with such cozenageist not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm And ist not to be damnd To let this canker of our nature come In further evil HORATIO It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there HAMLET It will be short The interim is mine And a mans lifes no more than to say One But I am very sorry good Horatio That to Laertes I forgot myself For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his Ill court his favours But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towring passion HORATIO Peace who comes here Enter Osric OSRIC Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark HAMLET I humbly thank you sir Dost know this waterfly HORATIO No my good lord HAMLET Thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him He hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as I say spacious in the possession of dirt OSRIC Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty HAMLET I will receive it with all diligence of spirit Put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head OSRIC I thank your lordship tis very hot HAMLET No believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly OSRIC It is indifferent cold my lord indeed HAMLET Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion OSRIC Exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas twereI cannot tell how But my lord his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head Sir this is the matter HAMLET I beseech you remember Hamlet moves him to put on his hat OSRIC Nay in good faith for mine ease in good faith Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see HAMLET Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy tharithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail But in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more OSRIC Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him HAMLET The concernancy sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath OSRIC Sir HORATIO Ist not possible to understand in another tongue You will dot sir really HAMLET What imports the nomination of this gentleman OSRIC Of Laertes HORATIO His purse is empty already alls golden words are spent HAMLET Of him sir OSRIC I know you are not ignorant HAMLET I would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me Well sir OSRIC You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is HAMLET I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself OSRIC I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowed HAMLET Whats his weapon OSRIC Rapier and dagger HAMLET Thats two of his weapons But well OSRIC The King sir hath wagerd with him six Barbary horses against the which he has imponed as I take it six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so Three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit HAMLET What call you the carriages HORATIO I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done OSRIC The carriages sir are the hangers HAMLET The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then But on Six Barbary horses against six French swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages thats the French bet against the Danish Why is this all imponed as you call it OSRIC The King sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him he shall not exceed you three hits He hath laid on twelve for nine And it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer HAMLET How if I answer no OSRIC I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial HAMLET Sir I will walk here in the hall If it please his Majesty it is the breathing time of day with me Let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the King hold his purpose I will win for him if I can if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hitsOSRIC Shall I redeliver you een so HAMLET To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will OSRIC I commend my duty to your lordship HAMLET Yours yours Exit Osric He does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else fors turn HORATIO This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head HAMLET He did comply with his dug before he suckd it Thus has heand many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out Enter a Lord LORD My lord his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time HAMLET I am constant to my purposes they follow the Kings pleasure If his fitness speaks mine is ready Now or whensoever provided I be so able as now LORD The King and Queen and all are coming down HAMLET In happy time LORD The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play HAMLET She well instructs me Exit Lord HORATIO You will lose this wager my lord HAMLET I do not think so Since he went into France I have been in continual practice I shall win at the odds But thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter HORATIO Nay good my lord HAMLET It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman HORATIO If your mind dislike anything obey it I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit HAMLET Not a whit we defy augury Theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come The readiness is all Since no man has aught of what he leaves what ist to leave betimes Enter King Queen Laertes Lords Osric and Attendants with foils c KING Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me The King puts Laertess hand into Hamlets HAMLET Give me your pardon sir I have done you wrong But pardont as you are a gentleman This presence knows and you must needs have heard How I am punishd with sore distraction What I have done That might your nature honour and exception Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness Wast Hamlet wrongd Laertes Never Hamlet If Hamlet from himself be taen away And when hes not himself does wrong Laertes Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it Who does it then His madness Ift be so Hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd His madness is poor Hamlets enemy Sir in this audience Let my disclaiming from a purposd evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow oer the house And hurt my brother LAERTES I am satisfied in nature Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge But in my terms of honour I stand aloof and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungord But till that time I do receive your offerd love like love And will not wrong it HAMLET I embrace it freely And will this brothers wager frankly play Give us the foils come on LAERTES Come one for me HAMLET Ill be your foil Laertes in mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i th darkest night Stick fiery off indeed LAERTES You mock me sir HAMLET No by this hand KING Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet You know the wager HAMLET Very well my lord Your Grace has laid the odds o the weaker side KING I do not fear it I have seen you both But since he is betterd we have therefore odds LAERTES This is too heavy Let me see another HAMLET This likes me well These foils have all a length They prepare to play OSRIC Ay my good lord KING Set me the stoups of wine upon that table If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange Let all the battlements their ordnance fire The King shall drink to Hamlets better breath And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmarks crown have worn Give me the cups And let the kettle to the trumpet speak The trumpet to the cannoneer without The cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth Now the King drinks to Hamlet Come begin And you the judges bear a wary eye HAMLET Come on sir LAERTES Come my lord They play HAMLET One LAERTES No HAMLET Judgement OSRIC A hit a very palpable hit LAERTES Well again KING Stay give me drink

KING Part them they are incensd HAMLET Nay come again The Queen falls OSRIC Look to the Queen there ho HORATIO They bleed on both sides How is it my lord OSRIC How ist Laertes LAERTES Why as a woodcock to my own springe Osric I am justly killd with mine own treachery HAMLET How does the Queen KING She swoons to see them bleed QUEEN No no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet The drink the drink I am poisond Dies HAMLET O villany Ho Let the door be lockd Treachery Seek it out Laertes falls LAERTES It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain No medicine in the world can do thee good In thee there is not half an hour of life The treacherous instrument is in thy hand Unbated and envenomd The foul practice Hath turnd itself on me Lo here I lie Never to rise again Thy mothers poisond I can no more The King the Kings to blame HAMLET The point envenomd too Then venom to thy work Stabs the King OSRIC and LORDS Treason treason KING O yet defend me friends I am but hurt HAMLET Here thou

Hamlet Mine and my fathers death come not upon thee Nor thine on me Dies HAMLET Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee I am dead Horatio Wretched Queen adieu You that look pale and tremble at this chance That are but mutes or audience to this act Had I but timeas this fell sergeant death Is strict in his arrestO I could tell you But let it be Horatio I am dead Thou livst report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied HORATIO Never believe it I am more an antique Roman than a Dane Heres yet some liquor left HAMLET As thart a man Give me the cup Let go by Heaven Ill havet O good Horatio what a wounded name Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity awhile And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story March afar off and shot within What warlike noise is this OSRIC Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley HAMLET O I die Horatio The potent poison quite oercrows my spirit I cannot live to hear the news from England But I do prophesy thelection lights On Fortinbras He has my dying voice So tell him with the occurrents more and less Which have solicited The rest is silence Dies HORATIO Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest Why does the drum come hither March within Enter Fortinbras the English Ambassadors and others FORTINBRAS Where is this sight HORATIO What is it you would see If aught of woe or wonder cease your search FORTINBRAS This quarry cries on havoc O proud death What feast is toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck FIRST AMBASSADOR The sight is dismal And our affairs from England come too late The ears are senseless that should give us hearing To tell him his commandment is fulfilld That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead Where should we have our thanks HORATIO Not from his mouth Had it thability of life to thank you He never gave commandment for their death But since so jump upon this bloody question You from the Polack wars and you from England Are here arrivd give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view And let me speak to th yet unknowing world How these things came about So shall you hear Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts Of accidental judgements casual slaughters Of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause And in this upshot purposes mistook Falln on the inventors heads All this can I Truly deliver FORTINBRAS Let us haste to hear it And call the noblest to the audience For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune I have some rights of memory in this kingdom Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me HORATIO Of that I shall have also cause to speak And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more But let this same be presently performd Even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance On plots and errors happen FORTINBRAS Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage For he was likely had he been put on To have provd most royally and for his passage The soldiers music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him Take up the bodies Such a sight as this Becomes the field but here shows much amiss Go bid the soldiers shoot A dead march Exeunt bearing off the bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off THE FIRST

Lancaster Earl of Westmoreland with others KING So shaken as we are so wan with care Find we a time for frighted peace to pant And breathe shortwinded accents of new broils To be commenced in strands afar remote No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood No more shall trenching war channel her fields Nor bruise her flowrets with the armed hoofs Of hostile paces those opposed eyes Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven All of one nature of one substance bred Did lately meet in the intestine shock And furious close of civil butchery Shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks March all one way and be no more opposed Against acquaintance kindred and allies The edge of war like an illsheathed knife No more shall cut his master Therefore friends As far as to the sepulchre of Christ Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross We are impressed and engaged to fight Forthwith a power of English shall we levy Whose arms were molded in their mothers womb To chase these pagans in those holy fields Over whose acres walked those blessed feet Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed For our advantage on the bitter cross But this our purpose now is twelve month old And bootless tis to tell you we will go Therefore we meet not now Then let me hear Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland What yesternight our Council did decree In forwarding this dear expedience WESTMORELAND My liege this haste was hot in question And many limits of the charge set down But yesternight when all athwart there came A post from Wales loaden with heavy news Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight Against the irregular and wild Glendower Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken A thousand of his people butchered Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse Such beastly shameless transformation By those Welshwomen done as may not be Without much shame retold or spoken of KING It seems then that the tidings of this broil Brake off our business for the Holy Land WESTMORELAND This matched with other did my gracious lord For more uneven and unwelcome news Came from the North and thus it did import On Holyrood day the gallant Hotspur there Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald That evervaliant and approved Scot At Holmedon met where they did spend A sad and bloody hour As by discharge of their artillery And shape of likelihood the news was told For he that brought them in the very heat And pride of their contention did take horse Uncertain of the issue any way KING Here is a dear and

eldest son To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Athol Of Murray Angus and Menteith And is not this an honourable spoil A gallant prize Ha cousin is it not WESTMORELAND In faith it is a conquest for a prince to boast of KING Yea there thou makst me sad and makst me sin In envy that my Lord Northumberland Should be the father to so blest a son A son who is the theme of honours tongue Amongst a grove the very straightest plant Who is sweet Fortunes minion and her pride Whilst I by looking on the praise of him See riot and dishonour stain the brow Of my young Harry O that it could be proved That some nighttripping fairy had exchanged In cradleclothes our children where they lay And called mine Percy his Plantagenet Then would I have his Harry and he mine But let him from my thoughts What think you coz Of this young Percys pride The prisoners Which he in this adventure hath surprised To his own use he keeps and sends me word I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife WESTMORELAND This is his uncles teaching this is Worcester Malevolent to you in all aspects Which makes him prune himself and bristle up The crest of youth against your dignity KING But I have sent for him to answer this And for this cause awhile we must neglect Our holy purpose to Jerusalem Cousin on Wednesday next our Council we Will hold at Windsor so inform the lords But come yourself with speed to us again

was about to tell thee when my heart As wedged with a sigh would rive in twain Lest Hector or my father should perceive me I have as when the sun doth light a storm Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile But sorrow that is couchd in seeming gladness Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadnessPANDARUS An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helens well go to there were no more comparison between the women But for my part she is my kinswoman I would not as they term it praise her but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did I will not dispraise your sister Cassandras wit but TROILUS O Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drownd Reply not in how many fathoms deep They lie indrenchd I tell thee I am mad In Cressids love Thou answerst She is fair Pourst in the open ulcer of my heart Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice Handlest in thy discourse O that her hand In whose comparison all whites are ink Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure The cygnets down is harsh and spirit of sense Hard as the palm of ploughman This thou tellst me As true thou tellst me when I say I love her But saying thus instead of oil and balm Thou layst in every gash that love hath given me The knife that made it PANDARUS I speak no more than truth TROILUS Thou dost not speak so much PANDARUS Faith Ill not meddle int Let her be as she is if she be fair tis the better for her and she be not she has the mends in her own hands TROILUS Good Pandarus How now Pandarus PANDARUS I have had my labour for my travail ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you gone between and between but small thanks for my labour TROILUS What art thou angry Pandarus What with me PANDARUS Because shes kin to me therefore shes not so fair as Helen And she were not kin to me she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday But what care I I care not and she were a blackamoor tis all one to me TROILUS Say I she is not fair PANDARUS I do not care whether you do or no Shes a fool to stay behind her father Let her to the Greeks and so Ill tell her the next time I see her For my part Ill meddle nor make no more i the matter TROILUS Pandarus PANDARUS Not I TROILUS Sweet Pandarus PANDARUS Pray you speak no more to me I will leave all as I found it and there an end Exit Pandarus An alarum TROILUS Peace you ungracious clamours Peace rude sounds Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair When with your blood you daily paint her thus I cannot fight upon this argument It is too starvd a subject for my sword But Pandarus O gods how do you plague me I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar And hes as tetchy to be wood to woo As she is stubbornchaste against all suit Tell me Apollo for thy Daphnes love What Cressid is what Pandar and what we Her bed is India there she lies a pearl Between our Ilium and where she resides Let it be calld the wild and wandering flood Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark Alarum Enter Aeneas AENEAS How now Prince Troilus Wherefore not afield TROILUS Because not there This womans answer sorts For womanish it is to be from thence What news Aeneas from the field today AENEAS That Paris is returned home and hurt TROILUS By whom Aeneas AENEAS Troilus by Menelaus TROILUS Let Paris bleed tis but a scar to scorn Paris is gord with Menelaus horn Alarum AENEAS Hark what good sport is out of town today TROILUS Better at home if would I might were may But to the sport abroad Are you bound thither AENEAS In all swift haste TROILUS Come go we then together Exeunt SCENE II Troy A street Enter Cressida and her man Alexander CRESSIDA Who were those went by ALEXANDER Queen Hecuba and Helen CRESSIDA And whither go they ALEXANDER Up to the eastern tower Whose height commands as subject all the vale To see the battle Hector whose patience Is as a virtue fixd today was movd He chid Andromache and struck his armourer And like as there were husbandry in war Before the sun rose he was harnessd light And to the field goes he where every flower Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw In Hectors wrath CRESSIDA What was his cause of anger ALEXANDER The noise goes this there is among the Greeks A lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hector They call him Ajax CRESSIDA Good and what of him ALEXANDER They say he is a very man per se And stands alone CRESSIDA So do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs ALEXANDER This man lady hath robbd many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephanta man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushd into folly his folly sauced with discretion There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of everything but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight CRESSIDA But how should this man that makes me smile make Hector angry ALEXANDER They say he yesterday copd Hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking Enter Pandarus CRESSIDA Who comes here ALEXANDER Madam your uncle Pandarus CRESSIDA Hectors a gallant man ALEXANDER As may be in the world lady PANDARUS Whats that Whats that CRESSIDA Good morrow uncle Pandarus PANDARUS Good morrow cousin Cressid What do you talk ofGood morrow AlexanderHow do you cousin

Troilus is the better man of the two CRESSIDA O Jupiter theres no comparison PANDARUS What not between Troilus and Hector Do you know a man if you see him CRESSIDA Ay if I ever saw him before and knew him PANDARUS Well I say Troilus is Troilus CRESSIDA Then you say as I say for I am sure he is not Hector PANDARUS No nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees CRESSIDA Tis just to each of them he is himself PANDARUS Himself Alas poor Troilus I would he were CRESSIDA So he is PANDARUS Condition I had gone barefoot to India CRESSIDA He is not Hector PANDARUS Himself no hes not himself Would a were himself Well the gods are above time must friend or end Well Troilus well I would my heart were in her body No Hector is not a better man than Troilus CRESSIDA Excuse me PANDARUS He is elder CRESSIDA Pardon me pardon me PANDARUS Thothers not come tot you shall tell me another tale when thothers come tot Hector shall not have his wit this year CRESSIDA He shall not need it if he have his own ANDARUS Nor his qualities CRESSIDA No matter PANDARUS Nor his beauty CRESSIDA Twould not become him his owns better PANDARUS You have no judgement niece Helen herself swore thother day that Troilus for a brown favour for so tis I must confessnot brown neither CRESSIDA No but brown PANDARUS Faith to say truth brown and not brown CRESSIDA To say the truth true and not true PANDARUS She praisd his complexion above Paris CRESSIDA Why Paris hath colour enough PANDARUS So he has CRESSIDA Then Troilus should have too much If she praisd him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion I had as lief Helens golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose PANDARUS I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris CRESSIDA Then shes a merry Greek indeed PANDARUS Nay I am sure she does She came to him thother day into the compassd windowand you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin CRESSIDA Indeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total PANDARUS Why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector CRESSIDA Is he so young a man and so old a lifter PANDARUS But to prove to you that Helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin CRESSIDA Juno have mercy How came it cloven PANDARUS Why you know tis dimpled I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia CRESSIDA O he smiles valiantly PANDARUS Does he not CRESSIDA O yes an twere a cloud in autumn PANDARUS Why go to then But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus CRESSIDA Troilus will stand to the proof if youll prove it so PANDARUS Troilus Why he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg CRESSIDA If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i th shell PANDARUS I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin Indeed she has a marvells white hand I must needs confess CRESSIDA Without the rack PANDARUS And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin CRESSIDA Alas poor chin Many a wart is richer PANDARUS But there was such laughing Queen Hecuba laughd that her eyes ran oer CRESSIDA With millstones PANDARUS And Cassandra laughd CRESSIDA But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes Did her eyes run oer too PANDARUS And Hector laughd CRESSIDA At what was all this laughing PANDARUS Marry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus chin CRESSIDA Andt had been a green hair I should have laughd too PANDARUS They laughd not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer CRESSIDA What was his answer PANDARUS Quoth she Heres but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white CRESSIDA This is her question PANDARUS Thats true make no question of that Two and fifty hairs quoth he and one white That white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons Jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is Paris my husband The forked one quoth he pluckt out and give it him But there was such laughing and Helen so blushd and Paris so chafd and all the rest so laughd that it passd CRESSIDA So let

soldiers pass PANDARUS Asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran porridge after meat I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus Neer look neer look the eagles are gone Crows and daws crows and daws I had rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece CRESSIDA There is amongst the Greeks Achilles a better man than Troilus PANDARUS Achilles A drayman a porter a very camel CRESSIDA Well well PANDARUS Well well Why have you any discretion Have you any eyes Do you know what a man is Is not birth beauty good shape discourse manhood learning gentleness virtue youth liberality and such like the spice and salt that season a man CRESSIDA Ay a mincd man and then to be bakd with no date in the pie for then the mans date is out PANDARUS You are such a woman A man knows not at what ward you lie CRESSIDA Upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these wards I lie at a thousand watches PANDARUS Say one of your watches CRESSIDA Nay Ill watch you for that and thats one of the chiefest of them too If I cannot ward what I would not have

niece by and by CRESSIDA To bring uncle PANDARUS Ay a token from Troilus Exit Pandarus CRESSIDA By the same token you are a bawd Words vows gifts tears and loves full sacrifice He offers in anothers enterprise But more in Troilus thousandfold I see Than in the glass of Pandars praise may be Yet hold I off Women are angels wooing Things won are done joys soul lies in the doing That she belovd knows naught that knows not this Men prize the thing ungaind more than it is That she was never yet that ever knew Love got so sweet as when desire did sue Therefore this maxim out of love I teach Achievement is command ungaind beseech Then though my hearts content firm love doth bear Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear Exit SCENE III The Grecian camp Before Agamemnons tent Sennet Enter Agamemnon Nestor Ulysses Diomedes Menelaus and others AGAMEMNON Princes What grief hath set these jaundies oer your cheeks The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on earth below Fails in the promisd largeness checks and disasters Grow in the veins of actions highest reard As knots by the conflux of meeting sap Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth Nor princes is it matter new to us That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years siege yet Troy walls stand Sith every action that hath gone before Whereof we have record trial did draw Bias and thwart not answering the aim And that unbodied figure of the thought That gavet surmised shape Why then you princes Do you with cheeks abashd behold our works And call them shames which are indeed naught else But the protractive trials of great Jove To find persistive constancy in men The fineness of which metal is not found In fortunes love For then the bold and coward The wise and fool the artist and unread The hard and soft seem all affind and kin But in the wind and tempest of her frown Distinction with a broad and powerful fan Puffing at all winnows the light away And what hath mass or matter by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled NESTOR With due observance of thy godlike seat Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply Thy latest words In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth How many shallow bauble boats dare sail Upon her patient breast making their way With those of nobler bulk But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis and anon behold The strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut Bounding between the two moist elements Like Perseus horse Wheres then the saucy boat Whose weak untimberd sides but even now Corivalld greatness Either to harbour fled Or made a toast for Neptune Even so Doth valours show and valours worth divide In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks And flies fled under shadewhy then the thing of courage As rousd with rage with rage doth sympathise And with an accent tund in selfsame key Retorts to chiding fortune ULYSSES Agamemnon Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit In whom the tempers and the minds of all Should be shut uphear what Ulysses speaks Besides thapplause and approbation The which To Agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway To Nestor And thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life I give to both your speecheswhich were such As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece Should hold up high in brass and such again As venerable Nestor hatchd in silver Should with a bond of air strong as the axletree On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears To his experiencd tongueyet let it please both Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak AGAMEMNON Speak Prince of Ithaca and bet of less expect That matter needless of importless burden Divide thy lips than we are confident When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws We shall hear music wit and oracle ULYSSES Troy yet upon his basis had been down And the great Hectors sword had lackd a master But for these instances The specialty of rule hath been neglected And look how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions When that the general is not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair What honey is expected Degree being vizarded Thunworthiest shows as fairly in the mask The heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthrond and spherd Amidst the other whose medcinable eye Corrects the influence of evil planets And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shakd Which is the ladder of all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce from dividable shores The primogenity and due of birth Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels But by degree stand in authentic place Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing melts In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong Between whose endless jar justice resides Should lose their names and so should justice too Then everything includes itself in power Power into will will into appetite And appetite an universal wolf So doubly seconded with will and power Must make perforce an universal preyAnd last eat up himself Great Agamemnon This chaos when degree is suffocate Follows the choking And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward with a purpose It hath to climb The generals disdaind By him one step below he by the next That next by him beneath so every step Exampld by the first pace that is sick Of his superior grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation And tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot Not her own sinews To end a tale of length Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength NESTOR Most wisely hath Ulysses here discoverd The fever whereof all our power is sick AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedy ULYSSES The great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries Excellent Tis Agamemnon right Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration Thats doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies weight Why this hath not a fingers dignity They call this bedwork mappry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution NESTOR Let this be granted and Achilles horse Makes many Thetis sons Tucket AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus MENELAUS From Troy Enter Aeneas AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent AENEAS Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you AGAMEMNON Even this AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles arm Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals AGAMEMNON How AENEAS Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers AENEAS Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd As bending angels thats their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Joves accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praisd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends AGAMEMNON Sir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas AENEAS Ay Greek that is my name AGAMEMNON Whats your affairs I pray you AENEAS Sir pardon tis for Agamemnons ears AGAMEMNON He hears naught privately that comes from Troy AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him I bring a trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speak AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnons sleeping hour That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake He tells thee so himself AENEAS Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fairst of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That feeds his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none hell say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so much AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hectors grandsire suckd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put this witherd brawns And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood Ill prove this troth with my three drops of blood AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ULYSSES Amen AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you sir Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor ULYSSES Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape NESTOR What ist ULYSSES This tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be croppd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all NESTOR Well and how ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgement Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose Pointing on him ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you NESTOR Why tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute With their finst palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly poisd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large It is supposd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As twere from forth us all a man distilld Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertaind limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance theyll sell If not the lustre of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are doggd with two strange followers NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should share with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foild Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lottry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off Well dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our projects life this shape of sense assumes Ajax employd plucks down Achilles plumes NESTOR Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone Exeunt ACT II SCENE I The Grecian camp Enter Ajax and Thersites AJAX Thersites THERSITES

second name of men obeys his points As if he were his officer Desperation Is all the policy strength and defence That Rome can make against them Enter a troop of Citizens MENENIUS Here comes the clusters And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus exile Now hes coming And not a hair upon a soldiers head Which will not prove a whip As many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down And pay you for your voices Tis no matter If he could burn us all into one coal We have deserved it ALL CITIZENS Faith we hear fearful news FIRST CITIZEN For mine own part When I said banish him I said twas pity SECOND CITIZEN And so did I THIRD CITIZEN And so did I And to say the truth so did very many of us

cry Shalls to the Capitol COMINIUS O ay what else Exeunt Cominius and Menenius SICINIUS Go masters get you home Be not dismayed These are a side that would be glad to have This true which they so seem

Even to my person than I thought he would When first I did embrace him Yet his nature In thats no changeling and I must excuse What cannot be amended LIEUTENANT Yet I wish sir I mean for your particularyou had not Joined in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solely AUFIDIUS I understand thee well and be thou sure When he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state Fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon As draw his sword yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine Wheneer we come to our account LIEUTENANT Sir I beseech you think you hell carry Rome AUFIDIUS All places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his The Senators and Patricians love him too The Tribunes are no soldiers and their people Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty To expel him thence I think hell be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish who takes it By sovereignty of nature First he was A noble servant to them but he could not Carry his honours even Whether twas pride Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From th casque to th cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controlled the war but one of these As he hath spices of them allnot all For I dare so far free himmade him feared So hated and so banished But he has a merit To choke it in the uttrance So our virtues Lie in th interpretation of the time And power unto itself most commendable Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair T extol what it hath done One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail

name i th fire Of burning Rome MENENIUS Why so you have made good work A pair of tribunes that have wracked Rome To make coals cheap A noble memory COMINIUS I minded him how royal twas to pardon When it was less expected He replied It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punished MENENIUS Very well Could he say less COMINIUS I offered to awaken his regard Fors private friends His answer to me was He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff He said twas folly For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt And still to nose th offence MENENIUS For one poor grain or two I am one of those His mother wife his child And this brave fellow too we are the grains You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon We must be burnt for you SICINIUS Nay pray be patient If you refuse your aid In this soneverneeded help yet do not Upbraids with our distress But sure if you Would be your countrys pleader your good tongue More than the instant army we can make

faith Ill prove him Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success Exit COMINIUS Hell never hear him SICINIUS Not COMINIUS I tell you he does sit in gold his eye Red as twould burn Rome and his injury The jailer to his pity I kneeled before him Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissed me Thus with his speechless hand What he would do He sent in writing after me what he Would not

Yield him who all thy human sons doth hate From forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb Let it no more bring out ingrateful man Go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face Hath to the marbled mansion all above Never presented O a root dear thanks Dry up thy marrows vines and ploughtorn leas Whereof ingrateful

wretched being Worse than the worst content Thou shouldst desire to die being miserable TIMON Not by his breath that is more miserable Thou art a slave whom Fortunes tender arm With favour never clasped but bred a dog Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded The sweet degrees that this brief world affords To such as may the passive drugs of it Freely command thou wouldst have plunged thyself In general riot melted down thy youth In different beds of lust and never learned The icy precepts of respect but followed The sugared game before thee But myself Who had the world as my confectionary The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men At duty more than I could frame employment That numberless upon me stuck as leaves Do on the oak have with one winters brush Fell from their boughs and left me open bare For every storm that blowsI to bear this That never knew but better is some burden Thy nature did commence in sufferance time Hath made thee hard int Why shouldst

the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers TIMON Women nearest but menmen are the things themselves What wouldst thou do with the world Apemantus if it lay in thy power APEMANTUS Give it the beasts to be rid of the men TIMON Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts APEMANTUS Ay Timon TIMON A beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t attain to If thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner Wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seized by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert germane to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life All thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence What beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast And what beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation APEMANTUS If thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou mightst have hit upon it here The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts TIMON How has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city APEMANTUS Yonder comes a poet and a painter The plague of company light upon thee I will fear to catch it and give way When I know not what else to do Ill see thee again TIMON When there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome I had rather be a beggars dog than Apemantus APEMANTUS Thou art the cap of all the fools alive TIMON Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon APEMANTUS A plague on thee Thou art too bad to curse TIMON All villains that do stand by thee are pure APEMANTUS There is no leprosy but what thou speakst TIMON If I name thee Ill beat thee but I should infect my hands APEMANTUS I would my tongue could rot them off TIMON

Throws a stone at him APEMANTUS Beast TIMON Slave APEMANTUS Toad TIMON Rogue rogue rogue I am sick of this false world and will love nought But even the mere necessities upont Then Timon presently prepare thy grave Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat Thy gravestone daily Make thine epitaph That death in me at others lives may laugh To the gold O thou sweet kingkiller and dear divorce Twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler Of Hymens purest bed thou valiant Mars Thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow That lies on Dians lap thou visible god That solderst close impossibilities And makst them kiss that speakst with every tongue To every purpose O thou touch of hearts Think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue Set them

berries water As beasts and birds and fishes TIMON Nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes You must eat men Yet thanks I must you con That you are thieves professed that you work not In holier shapes for there is boundless theft In limited professions Rascal thieves Heres gold Go suck the subtle blood o th grape Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth And so scape hanging Trust not the physician His antidotes are poison and he slays More than you rob Take wealth and lives together Do villainy do since you protest to dot Like workmen Ill example you with thievery The suns a thief and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea the moons an arrant thief And her pale fire she snatches from the sun The seas a thief whose liquid surge resolves The moon into salt tears the earths a thief That feeds and breeds by a composture stoln From general excrement Each things a thief The laws your curb and whip in their rough power Has unchecked theft Love not yourselves away

know thee not I never had honest man about me I all I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains FLAVIUS The gods are witness Neer did poor steward wear a truer grief For his undone lord than mine eyes for you TIMON What dost thou weep Come nearer then I love thee Because thou art a woman and disclaimst Flinty mankind whose eyes do never give But thorough lust and laughter Pitys sleeping Strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping FLAVIUS I beg of you to know me good my lord T accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts To entertain me as your steward still TIMON Had I a steward So true so just and now so comfortable It almost turns my dangerous nature mild Let me behold thy face Surely this man Was born of woman Forgive my general and exceptless rashness You perpetual sober gods I do proclaim One honest man mistake me not but one No more I pray and hes a steward How fain would I have hated all mankind And thou redeemst thyself But all save thee I fell with curses Methinks thou art more honest now than wise For by oppressing and betraying me Thou mightst have sooner got another service For many so arrive at second masters Upon their first lords neck But tell me true For I must ever doubt though neer so sure Is not thy kindness subtle covetous A usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts Expecting in return twenty for one FLAVIUS No my most worthy master in whose breast Doubt and suspect alas are placed too late You should have feared false times when you did feast Suspect still comes where an estate is least That which I show heaven knows is merely love Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind Care of your food and living And believe it My most honoured lord For any benefit that points to me Either in hope or present Id exchange For this one wish that you had power and wealth To requite me by making rich yourself TIMON Look thee tis so Thou singly honest man Here take The gods out of my misery Have sent thee treasure Go live rich and happy But thus conditioned thou shalt build from men Hate all curse all show charity to none But let the famished flesh slide from the bone Ere thou relieve the beggar give to dogs What thou

Painter PAINTER As I took note of the place it cannot be far where he abides POET Whats to be thought of him Does the rumour hold for true that he is so full of gold PAINTER Certain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him He likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum POET Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends PAINTER Nothing else You shall see him a palm in Athens again and flourish with the highest Therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his It will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be a just and true report that goes of his having POET What have you now to present unto him PAINTER Nothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent piece POET I must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming toward him PAINTER Good as the best Promising is the very air o th time it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it Enter Timon from his cave TIMON Aside Excellent workman Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself POET I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him It must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the

Give me some music Now good morrow friends Now good Cesario but that piece of song That old and antique song we heard last night Methought it did relieve my passion much More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddypaced times Come but one verse CURIO He is not here so please your lordship that should sing it DUKE Who was it CURIO Feste the jester my lord a fool that the Lady Olivias father took much delight in He is about the house DUKE Seek him out and play the tune the while Exit Curio Music plays Come hither boy If ever thou shalt love In the sweet pangs

your favour DUKE What kind of woman ist VIOLA Of your complexion DUKE She is not worth thee then What years i faith VIOLA About your years my lord DUKE Too old by heaven Let still the woman take An elder than herself so wears she to him So sways she level in her husbands heart For boy however we do praise ourselves Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm More longing wavering sooner lost and worn Than womens are VIOLA I think it well my lord DUKE Then let thy love be younger than thyself Or thy affection cannot hold the bent For women are as roses whose fair flower Being once displayd doth fall that very hour VIOLA And so they are alas that they are so To die even when they to perfection grow Enter Curio and Clown DUKE O fellow come the song we had last night Mark it Cesario it is old and plain The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it it is silly sooth And dallies with the innocence of love Like the old age CLOWN Are you ready sir DUKE Ay prithee sing Music The Clowns song Come away come away death And in sad cypress let me be laid Fly away fly away breath I am slain by a fair cruel maid My shroud of

sir DUKE Ill pay thy pleasure then CLOWN Truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another DUKE Give me now leave to leave thee CLOWN Now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy

have for Olivia you cannot love her You tell her so Must she not then be answerd DUKE There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart no womans heart So big to hold so much they lack retention Alas their love may be called appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia VIOLA Ay but I know DUKE What dost thou know VIOLA Too well what love women to men may owe In faith they are as true of heart as we My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be perhaps were I a woman I should your lordship DUKE And whats her history VIOLA A blank my lord She never told her love But let concealment like a worm i th bud Feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like patience on a monument Smiling at grief Was not this love

wash off gross acquaintance I will be pointdevice the very man I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me She did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being crossgartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking I thank my stars I am happy I will be strange stout in yellow stockings and crossgartered even with the swiftness of putting on Jove and my stars be praisedHere is yet a postscript Reads Thou canst not choose but know who

whence you come who you are and what you would are out of my welkin I might say element but the word is overworn Exit VIOLA This fellow is wise enough to play the fool And to do that well craves a kind of wit He must observe their mood on whom he jests The quality of persons and the time And like the haggard check at every feather That comes before his eye This is a practice As full of labour

come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf OLIVIA O by your leave I pray you I bade you never speak again of him But would you undertake another suit I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres VIOLA Dear lady OLIVIA Give me leave beseech you I did send After the last enchantment you did here A ring in chase of you So did I abuse Myself my servant and I fear me you Under your hard construction must I sit To force that on you in a shameful cunning Which you knew none of yours What might you think Have you not set mine honour at the stake And baited it with all th

have you be VIOLA Would it be better madam than I am I wish it might for now I am your fool OLIVIA O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip A murdrous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid Loves night is noon Cesario by the roses of the spring By maidhood honour truth and everything I love thee so that maugre all thy pride Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide Do not extort thy reasons from this clause For that I woo thou therefore hast no cause But rather reason thus with reason fetter Love sought is good but given unsought is better VIOLA By innocence I swear and by my youth I have one heart one bosom and one truth And that no woman has nor never none Shall mistress be of it save I alone And so adieu good madam never more Will I my masters tears to you deplore OLIVIA Yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move That heart which now abhors to like his love Exeunt SCENE II A Room in Olivias House Enter Sir Toby Sir Andrew

grandjurymen since before Noah was a sailor FABIAN She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver You should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness This was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my ladys opinion where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy SIR ANDREW Andt be any way it must be with valour for policy I hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician SIR TOBY Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour Challenge me the Counts youth to fight with him Hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no lovebroker in the world can more prevail in mans commendation with woman than report of valour FABIAN There is no way but this Sir Andrew SIR ANDREW Will either of you bear me a challenge to him SIR TOBY Go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention Taunt him with the licence of ink If thou thoust him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy

who shortly shall be dead Exeunt SCENE V London The Tower Walls Enter Richard and Buckingham in rotten armour marvellous illfavoured RICHARD Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colourMurder thy breath in middle of a word And then again begin and stop again As if thou were distraught and mad with terror BUCKINGHAM Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian Speak and look back and pry on every side Tremble and start at wagging of a straw Intending deep suspicion Ghastly looks Are at my service like enforced smiles And both are ready in their offices At anytime to grace my stratagems But what is Catesby gone RICHARD He is and see he brings the Mayor along Enter the Lord Mayor and Catesby BUCKINGHAM Lord Mayor RICHARD Look to the drawbridge there BUCKINGHAM Hark a drum RICHARD Catesby oerlook the walls BUCKINGHAM Lord Mayor the reason we have sent RICHARD Look back Defend thee here are enemies BUCKINGHAM God and our innocence defend and guard us Enter Lovell and Ratcliffe with Hastings head RICHARD Be patient they are friends Ratcliffe and Lovell LOVELL Here is the head of that ignoble traitor The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings RICHARD So dear I loved the man that I must weep I took him for the plainest harmless creature That breathed upon the earth a Christian Made him my book wherein my soul recorded The history of all her secret thoughts So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That his apparent open guilt omitted I mean his conversation with Shores wife He lived from all attainder of suspects BUCKINGHAM Well well he was the covertst sheltered traitor That ever lived Would you imagine or almost believe Weret not that by great preservation We live to tell it that the subtle traitor This day had plotted in the councilhouse To murder me and my good lord of Gloucester MAYOR Had he done so RICHARD What think you we are Turks or Infidels Or that we would against the form of law Proceed thus rashly in the villains death But that the extreme peril of the case The peace of England and our persons safety Enforced us to this execution MAYOR Now fair befall you He deserved his death And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts BUCKINGHAM I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore Yet had we not determined he should die Until your lordship came to see his end Which now the loving haste of these our friends Something against our meanings have prevented Because my lord we would have had you heard The traitor speak and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens who haply may Misconster us in him and wail his death MAYOR But my good lord your Graces word shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak And do not doubt right noble princes both But Ill acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case RICHARD And to that end we wished your lordship here T avoid the censures of the carping world BUCKINGHAM But since you come too late of our intent Yet witness what you hear we did intend And so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell Exit Lord Mayor RICHARD Go after after cousin Buckingham The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post There at your meetst advantage of the time Infer the bastardy of Edwards children Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the Crownmeaning indeed his house Which by the sign thereof was termed so Moreover urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust Which stretched unto their servants daughters wives Even where his raging eye or savage heart Without control lusted to make a prey Nay for a need thus far come near my person Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward noble York My princely father then had wars in France And by true computation of the time Found that the issue was not his begot Which well appeared in his lineaments Being nothing like the noble Duke my father Yet touch this sparingly as twere far off Because my lord you know my mother lives BUCKINGHAM Doubt not my lord Ill play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself And so my lord adieu RICHARD If you thrive well bring them to Baynards Castle Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and welllearned bishops BUCKINGHAM I go and towards three or four oclock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords Exit RICHARD Go Lovell with all speed to Doctor Shaa To Ratcliffe Go thou to Friar Penker bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynards Castle Exeunt Ratcliffe and Lovell Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight And to give order that no manner person Have any time recourse unto the Princes Exit SCENE VI London A street Enter a Scrivener SCRIVENER Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed That it may be today read oer in Pauls And mark how well the sequel hangs together Eleven hours I have spent to write it over For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me The precedent was full as long adoing And yet within these five hours Hastings lived Untainted unexamined free at liberty Heres a good world the while Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device Yet who so bold but says he sees it not Bad is the world and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought Exit SCENE VII London Court of Baynards Castle Enter Richard and Buckingham at several doors RICHARD How now how now What say the citizens BUCKINGHAM Now by the holy mother of our Lord The citizens are mum say not a word RICHARD Touched you the bastardy of Edwards children BUCKINGHAM I did with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France Th insatiate greediness of his desire And his enforcement of the city wives His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy As being got your father then in France And his resemblance being not like the Duke Withal I did infer your lineaments Being the right idea of your father Both in your form and nobleness of mind Laid open all your victories in Scotland Your discipline in war wisdom in peace Your bounty virtue fair humility Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouched or slightly handled in discourse And when mine oratory drew toward end I bid them that did love their countrys good Cry God save Richard Englands royal King RICHARD And did they so BUCKINGHAM No so God help me they spake not a word But like dumb statues or breathing stones Stared each on other and looked deadly pale Which when I saw I reprehended them And asked the Mayor what meant this wilful silence His answer was the people were not used To be spoke to but by the Recorder Then he was urged to tell my tale again Thus saith the Duke thus hath the Duke inferred But nothing spoke in warrant from himself When he had done some followers of mine own At lower end of the hall hurled up their caps And some ten voices cried God save King Richard And thus I took the vantage of those few Thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I This general applause and cheerful shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard And even here brake off and came away RICHARD What tongueless blocks were they Would they not speak Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come BUCKINGHAM The mayor is here at hand Intend some fear Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit And look you get a prayerbook in your hand And stand between two churchmen good my lord For on that ground Ill make a holy descant And be not easily won to our requests Play the maids part still answer nay and take it RICHARD I go and if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself No doubt we bring it to a happy issue BUCKINGHAM Go go up to the leads the Lord Mayor knocks Exit Richard Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens Welcome my lord I dance attendance here I think the Duke will not be spoke withal Enter Catesby Now Catesby what says your lord to my request CATESBY He doth entreat your Grace my noble lord To visit him tomorrow or next day He is within with two right reverend fathers Divinely bent to meditation And in no worldly suits would he be moved To draw him from his holy exercise BUCKINGHAM Return good Catesby to the gracious Duke Tell him myself the Mayor and aldermen In deep designs in matter of great moment No less importing than our general good Are come to have some conference with his Grace CATESBY Ill signify so much unto him straight Exit BUCKINGHAM Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward He is not lolling on a lewd lovebed But on his knees at meditation Not dallying with a brace of courtesans But meditating with two deep divines Not sleeping to engross his idle body But praying to enrich his watchful soul Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof But sure I fear we shall not win him to it MAYOR Marry God defend his Grace should say us nay BUCKINGHAM I fear he will Here Catesby comes again Enter Catesby Now Catesby what says his Grace CATESBY He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him His Grace not being warned thereof before He fears my lord you mean no good to him BUCKINGHAM Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him By heaven we come to him in perfect love And so once more return and tell his Grace Exit Catesby When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads tis much to draw them thence So sweet is zealous contemplation Enter Richard aloft between two Bishops Catesby reenters MAYOR See where his Grace stands tween two clergymen BUCKINGHAM Two props of virtue for a Christian prince To stay him from the fall of vanity And see a book of prayer in his hand True ornaments to know a holy man Famous Plantagenet most gracious Prince Lend favourable ear to our requests And pardon us the interruption Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal RICHARD My lord there needs no such apology I do beseech your Grace to pardon me Who earnest in the service of my God Deferred the visitation of my friends But leaving this what is your Graces pleasure BUCKINGHAM Even that I hope which pleaseth God above And all good men of this ungoverned isle RICHARD I do suspect I have done some offence That seems disgracious in the citys eye And that you come to reprehend my ignorance BUCKINGHAM You have my lord Would it might please your GraceOn our entreaties to amend your fault RICHARD Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land BUCKINGHAM Know then it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat the throne majestical The sceptered office of your ancestors Your state of fortune and your due of birth The lineal glory of your royal house To the corruption of a blemished stock Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts Which here we waken to our countrys good The noble isle doth want her proper limbs Her face defaced with scars of infamy Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion Which to recure we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land Not as Protector steward substitute Or lowly factor for anothers gain But as successively from blood to blood Your right of birth your empery your own For this consorted with the citizens Your very worshipful and loving friends And by their vehement instigation In this just cause come I to move your Grace RICHARD I cannot tell if to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof Best fitteth my degree or your condition If not to answer you might haply think Tonguetied ambition not replying yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty Which fondly you would here impose on me If to reprove you for this suit of yours So seasoned with your faithful love to me Then on the other side I checked my friends Therefore to speak and to avoid the first And then in speaking not to incur the last Definitively thus I answer you Your love deserves my thanks but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request First if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth Yet so much is my poverty of spirit So mighty and so many my defects That I would rather hide me from my greatness Being a bark to brook no mighty sea Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapour of my glory smothered But God be thanked there is no need of me And much I need to help you were there need The royal tree hath left us royal fruit Which mellowed by the stealing hours of time Will well become the seat of majesty And make no doubt us happy by his reign On him I lay that you would lay on me The right and fortune of his happy stars Which God defend that I should wring from him BUCKINGHAM My lord this argues conscience in your Grace But the respects thereof are nice and trivial All circumstances well considered You say that Edward is your brothers son So say we too but not by Edwards wife For first was he contract to Lady Lucy Your mother lives a witness to his vow And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona sister to the King of France These both put off a poor petitioner A carecrazed mother to a many sons A beautywaning and distressed widow Even in the afternoon of her best days Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward whom our manners call the Prince More bitterly could I expostulate Save that for reverence to some alive I give a sparing limit to my tongue Then good my lord take to your royal self This proffered benefit of dignity If not to bless us and the land withal Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal truederived course MAYOR Do good my lord Your citizens entreat you BUCKINGHAM Refuse not mighty lord this proffered love CATESBY O make them joyful grant their lawful suit RICHARD Alas why would you heap those cares on me I am unfit for state and majesty I do beseech you take it not amiss I cannot nor I will not yield to you BUCKINGHAM If you refuse it as in love and zeal Loath to depose the child your brothers son As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle kind effeminate remorse Which we have noted in you to your kindred And equally indeed to all estates Yet know wheer you accept our suit or no Your brothers son shall never reign our king But we will plant some other in the throne To the disgrace and downfall of your house And in this resolution here we leave you Come citizens zounds Ill entreat no more Exeunt Buckingham the Mayor and citizens CATESBY Call him again sweet Prince accept their suit If you deny them all the land will rue it RICHARD Will you enforce me to a world of cares Call them again I am not made of stones But penetrable to your kind entreaties Albeit against my conscience and my soul Enter Buckingham and the rest Cousin of Buckingham and sage grave men Since you will buckle Fortune on my back To bear her burden wheer I will or no I must have patience to endure the load But if black scandal or foulfaced reproach Attend the sequel of your imposition Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and stains thereof For God doth know and you may partly see How far I am from the desire of this MAYOR God bless your Grace We see it and will say it RICHARD In saying so you shall but say the truth BUCKINGHAM Then I salute you with this royal title Long live King Richard Englands worthy King ALL Amen BUCKINGHAM Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned RICHARD Even when you please for you will have it so BUCKINGHAM Tomorrow then we will attend your Grace And so most joyfully we take our leave RICHARD To the Bishops Come let us to our holy work again Farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I London Before the Tower Enter Queen Elizabeth the

hatched to the world Whose unavoided eye is murderous STANLEY Come madam come I in all haste was sent ANNE And I with all unwillingness will go O would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal

To feed my humour wish thyself no harm ANNE No Why When he that is my husband now Came to me as I followed Henrys corse When scarce the blood was well washed from his hands Which issued from my other angel husband And that dear saint which then I weeping followed O when I say I looked on Richards face This was my wish Be thou quoth I accursed For making me so young so old a widow And when thou weddst let sorrow haunt thy bed And be thy wife if any be so mad More miserable by the life of thee Than thou hast made me by my dear lords death Lo ere I can repeat this curse again Within so small a time my womans heart Grossly grew captive to his honey words And proved the subject of mine own souls curse Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest For never yet one hour in his bed Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep But with his timorous dreams was still awaked Besides he hates me for my father Warwick And will no doubt shortly be rid of me QUEEN ELIZABETH Poor heart adieu I pity thy complaining ANNE No more than with my soul I mourn for yours DORSET Farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory ANNE Adieu poor soul that takst thy leave of it DUCHESS To Dorset Go thou to Richmond and good fortune guide thee To Anne Go thou to Richard and good angels tend thee To Queen Elizabeth Go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me

deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of Dighton and Forrest who I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery Albeit they were fleshed villains bloody dogs Melted with

arms Their lips were four red roses on a stalk And in their summer beauty kissed each other A book of prayers on their pillow lay Which once quoth Forrest almost changed my mind But O the devil There

Give mine the benefit of seigniory And let my griefs frown on the upper hand If sorrow can admit society Sitting down with them Tell oer your woes again by viewing mine I had an Edward till a Richard killed him I had a husband till a Richard killed him Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him DUCHESS I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him I had a Rutland too thou holpst to kill himQUEEN MARGARET Thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard killed him From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death That dog that had his teeth before his eyes To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood That excellent grand tyrant of the earth That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls That foul defacer of Gods handiwork Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves O upright just and truedisposing God How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mothers body And makes her pewfellow with others moan DUCHESS O Harrys wife triumph not in my woes God witness with me I have wept for thine QUEEN MARGARET Bear with me I am hungry for revenge And now I cloy me with beholding it Thy Edward he is dead that killed my Edward The other Edward dead to quit my Edward Young York he is but boot because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward And the beholders of this frantic play Th adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey Untimely smothered in their dusky graves Richard yet lives hells black intelligencer Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither But at hand at hand Ensues his piteous and unpitied end Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray To have him suddenly conveyed from hence Cancel his bond of life dear God I pray That I may live to say The dog is dead QUEEN ELIZABETH O thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider that foul bunchbacked toad QUEEN MARGARET I called thee then vain flourish of my fortune I called thee then poor shadow painted queen The presentation of but what I was The flattering index of a direful pageant One heaved ahigh to be hurled down below A mother only mocked with two fair babes A dream of what thou wast a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot A sign of dignity a breath a bubble A queen in jest only to fill the scene Where is thy husband now Where be thy brothers Where are thy two sons Wherein dost thou joy Who sues and kneels and says God save the Queen Where be the bending peers that flattered thee Where be the thronging troops that followed thee Decline all this and see what now thou art For happy wife a most distressed widow For joyful mother one that wails the name For one being sued to one that humbly sues For Queen a very caitiff crowned with care For she that scorned at me now scorned of me For she being feared of all now fearing one For she commanding all obeyed of none Thus hath the course of justice wheeled about And left thee but a very prey to time Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more being what thou art Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke From which even here I slip my weary head And leave the burden of it all on thee Farewell Yorks wife and Queen of sad mischance These English woes shall make me smile in France QUEEN ELIZABETH O thou well skilled in curses stay awhile And teach me how to curse mine enemies QUEEN MARGARET Forbear to sleep the night and fast the days Compare dead happiness with living woe Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were And he that slew them fouler than he is Bettering thy loss makes the badcauser worse Revolving this will teach thee how to curse QUEEN ELIZABETH My words are dull O quicken them with thine QUEEN MARGARET Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine Exit DUCHESS Why should calamity be full of words QUEEN ELIZABETH Windy attorneys to their clients woes Airy succeeders of intestate joys Poor breathing orators of miseries Let them have scope though what they do impart Help nothing else yet do they ease the heart DUCHESS If so then be not tonguetied Go with me And in the breath of bitter words lets smother My damned son that thy two sweet sons smothered A trumpet sounds The trumpet sounds Be copious in exclaims Enter King Richard and his Train including Catesby marching KING RICHARD Who intercepts me in my expedition DUCHESS O she that might have intercepted thee By strangling thee in her accursed womb From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done QUEEN ELIZABETH Hidst thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded if that right were right The slaughter of the Prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers Tell me thou villainslave where are my children DUCHESS Thou toad thou toad where is thy brother Clarence And little Ned Plantagenet his son QUEEN ELIZABETH Where is the gentle Rivers Vaughan Grey DUCHESS Where is kind Hastings KING RICHARD A flourish trumpets Strike alarum drums Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lords anointed Strike I say Flourish Alarums Either be patient and entreat me fair Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations DUCHESS Art thou my son KING RICHARD Ay I thank God my father and yourself DUCHESS Then patiently hear my impatience KING RICHARD Madam I have a touch of your condition That cannot brook the accent of reproof DUCHESS O let me speak KING RICHARD Do then but Ill not hear DUCHESS I will be mild and gentle in my words KING RICHARD And brief good mother for I am in haste DUCHESS Art thou so hasty I have stayed for thee God knows in torment and in agony KING RICHARD And came I not at last to comfort you DUCHESS No by the Holy Rood thou knowst it well Thou camst on earth to make the earth my hell A grievous burden was thy birth to me Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy Thy schooldays frightful desprate wild and furious Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous Thy age confirmed proud subtle sly and bloody More mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred What comfortable hour canst thou name That ever graced me with thy company KING RICHARD Faith none but Humphrey Hower that called your Grace To breakfast once forth of my company If I be so disgracious in your eye Let me march on and not offend you madam Strike up the drum DUCHESS I prithee hear me speak KING RICHARD You speak too bitterly DUCHESS Hear me a word For I shall never speak to thee again KING RICHARD So DUCHESS Either thou wilt die by Gods just ordinance Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish And never more behold thy face again Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armour that thou wearst My prayers on the adverse party fight And there the little souls of Edwards children Whisper the spirits of thine enemies And promise them success and victory Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH Though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me I say amen to her KING RICHARD Stay madam I must talk a word with you QUEEN ELIZABETH I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter For my daughters Richard They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens And therefore level not to hit their lives KING RICHARD You have a daughter called Elizabeth Virtuous and fair royal and gracious QUEEN ELIZABETH And must she die for this O let her live And Ill corrupt her manners stain her beauty Slander myself as false to Edwards bed Throw over her the veil of infamy So she may live unscarred"

soles I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move MERCUTIO You are a lover borrow Cupids wings And soar with them above a common bound ROMEO I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe Under loves heavy burden do I sink MERCUTIO And to sink in it should you burden love Too great oppression for a tender thing ROMEO Is love a tender thing It is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn MERCUTIO If love be rough with you be rough with love Prick love for pricking and you beat love down Give me a case to put my visage in Putting on a mask A visor for a visor What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities Here are the beetlebrows shall blush for me BENVOLIO Come knock

Well what was yours MERCUTIO That dreamers often lie ROMEO In bed asleep while they do dream things true MERCUTIO O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you She is the fairies midwife and she comes In shape no bigger than an agatestone On the forefinger of an alderman Drawn with a team of little atomies Over mens noses as they lie asleep Her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs The cover of the wings of grasshoppers Her traces of the smallest spiders web The collars of the moonshines watery beams Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film Her waggoner a small greycoated gnat Not half so big as a round little worm Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains and then they dream of love Oer courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees Oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep Then dreams he of another benefice Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats Of breaches ambuscados Spanish blades Of healths five fathom deep and then anon Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs Which once untangled much misfortune bodes This is the hag when maids lie on their backs That presses them and learns them first to bear Making them women of good carriage This is she ROMEO Peace peace Mercutio peace Thou talkst of nothing MERCUTIO True I talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Begot of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north And being angerd puffs away from thence Turning his side to the dewdropping south BENVOLIO This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves Supper is done and we shall come too lateROMEO I fear too early for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this nights revels and expire the term Of a despised life closd in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death But he that hath the steerage of my course Direct my suit On lusty gentlemen BENVOLIO Strike drum Exeunt SCENE V A Hall in Capulets House Musicians waiting Enter Servants FIRST SERVANT Wheres Potpan that he helps not to take away He shift a trencher He scrape a trencher SECOND SERVANT When good manners shall lie all in one or two mens hands and they unwashd too tis a foul thing

lie And young affection gapes to be his heir That fair for which love groand for and would die With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair Now Romeo is belovd and loves again Alike bewitched by the charm of looks But to his foe supposd he must complain And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks Being held a foe he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear And she as much in love her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere But passion lends them power time means to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet Exit SCENE I An open place adjoining Capulets Garden Enter Romeo ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out He climbs the wall and leaps down within it Enter Benvolio and Mercutio BENVOLIO Romeo My cousin Romeo Romeo MERCUTIO He is wise And on my life hath stoln him home to bed BENVOLIO He ran this way and leapd this orchard wall Call good Mercutio MERCUTIO Nay Ill conjure too Romeo Humours

purblind son and heir Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lovd the beggarmaid He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not The ape is dead and I must conjure him I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes By her high forehead and her scarlet lip By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh And the demesnes that there adjacent lie That in thy likeness thou appear to us BENVOLIO An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him MERCUTIO This cannot anger him Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress circle Of some strange nature letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjurd it down That were some spite My invocation Is fair and honest and in his mistress name I conjure only but to raise up him BENVOLIO Come he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night Blind is his love and best befits the dark MERCUTIO If love be blind love cannot hit the mark Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone O Romeo that she were O that she were An openarse and thou a poperin pear Romeo good night Ill to my trucklebed This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep Come shall we go BENVOLIO Go then for tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found Exeunt SCENE II Capulets Garden Enter Romeo ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound Juliet appears above at a window But soft what light through yonder window breaks It is the east and Juliet is the sun Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she Be not her maid since she is envious Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it cast it off It is my lady O it is my love O that she knew she were She speaks yet she says nothing What of that Her eye discourses I will answer it I am too bold tis not to me she speaks Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return What if her eyes were there they in her head The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night See how she leans her cheek upon her hand O that I were a glove upon that handThat I might touch that cheek JULIET Ay me ROMEO She speaks O speak again bright angel for thou art As glorious to this night being oer my head As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazypuffing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air JULIET O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo Deny thy father and refuse thy name Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love And Ill no longer be a Capulet ROMEO Aside Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this JULIET Tis but thy name that is my enemy Thou art thyself though not a Montague Whats Montague It is nor hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man O be some other name Whats in a name That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title Romeo doff thy name And for thy name which is no part of thee Take all myself ROMEO I take thee at thy word Call me but love and Ill be new baptisd Henceforth I never will be Romeo JULIET What man art thou that thus bescreend in night So stumblest on my counsel ROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am My name dear saint is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee Had I it written I would tear the word JULIET My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words Of thy tongues utterance yet I know the sound Art thou not Romeo and a Montague ROMEO Neither fair maid if either thee dislike JULIET How camst thou hither tell me and wherefore The orchard walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art If any of my kinsmen find thee here ROMEO With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls For stony limits cannot hold love out And what love can do that dares love attempt Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me JULIET If they do see thee they will murder thee ROMEO Alack there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet And I am proof against their enmity JULIET I would not for the world they saw thee here ROMEO I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes And but thou love me let them find me here My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued wanting of thy love JULIET By whose direction foundst thou out this place ROMEO By love that first did prompt me to enquire He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes I am no pilot yet wert thou as far As that vast shore washd with the farthest sea I should adventure for such merchandise JULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny What I have spoke but farewell compliment Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay And I will take thy word Yet if thou swearst Thou mayst prove false At lovers perjuries They say Jove laughs"

rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla Dennis Enter Dennis DENNIS Calls your worship OLIVER Was not Charles the Dukes wrestler here to speak with me DENNIS So please you he is here at

Whats the new news at the new court CHARLES Theres no news at the court sir but the old news That is the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander OLIVER Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter be banished with her father CHARLES O no for the Dukes daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do OLIVER Where will the old Duke live CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world OLIVER What you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in Therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will OLIVER Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other For I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come tomorrow Ill give him his payment If ever he go alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more And so God keep your worship Exit OLIVER Farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an end of him for my soulyet I know not whyhates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that I am altogether misprized But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about Exit SCENE II A Lawn before the Dukes Palace Enter Rosalind and Celia CELIA I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry ROSALIND Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure CELIA Herein I see thou lovst me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine So wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee ROSALIND Well I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours CELIA You know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection By mine honour I will And when I break that oath let me turn monster Therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry ROSALIND From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let me seewhat think you of falling in love CELIA Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again ROSALIND What shall be our sport then CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally ROSALIND I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women CELIA Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very illfavouredly ROSALIND Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of Nature Enter Touchstone CELIA No When Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ROSALIND Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of Natures wit CELIA Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the witsHow now wit whither wander you TOUCHSTONE Mistress you must come away to your father CELIA Were you made the messenger TOUCHSTONE No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you ROSALIND Where learned you that oath fool TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught Now Ill stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn CELIA How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ROSALIND Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom TOUCHSTONE Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave CELIA By our beards if we had them thou art TOUCHSTONE By my knavery if I had it then I were But if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn No more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard CELIA Prithee who ist that thou meanst TOUCHSTONE One that old Frederick your father loves CELIA My fathers love is enough to honour him Enough Speak no more of him Youll be whipped for taxation one of these days TOUCHSTONE The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly CELIA By my troth thou sayest true For since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le BeauEnter Le Beau ROSALIND With his mouth full of news CELIA Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young ROSALIND Then shall we be newscrammed CELIA All the better we shall be the more marketable Bonjour Monsieur Le Beau Whats the news LE BEAU Fair princess you have lost much good sport CELIA Sport Of what colour LE BEAU What colour madam How shall I answer you ROSALIND As wit and fortune will TOUCHSTONE Or as the destinies decrees CELIA Well said That was laid on with a trowel TOUCHSTONE Nay if I keep not my rank ROSALIND Thou losest thy old smell LE BEAU You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of ROSALIND Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling LE BEAU I will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it CELIA Well the beginning that is dead and buried LE BEAU There comes an old man and his three sons CELIA I could match this beginning with an old tale LE BEAU Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence ROSALIND With bills on their necks Be it known unto all men by these presents LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the Dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him So he served the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping ROSALIND Alas TOUCHSTONE But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost LE BEAU Why this that I speak of TOUCHSTONE Thus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies CELIA Or I I promise thee ROSALIND But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon ribbreaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin LE BEAU You must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it CELIA Yonder sure they are coming Let us now stay and see it Flourish Enter Duke Frederick Lords Orlando Charles and Attendants DUKE FREDERICK Come on Since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness ROSALIND Is yonder the man LE BEAU Even he madam CELIA Alas he is too young Yet he looks successfully DUKE FREDERICK How now daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ROSALIND Ay my liege so please you give us leave DUKE FREDERICK You will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man In pity of the challengers youth I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if you can move him CELIA Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau DUKE FREDERICK Do so Ill not be by Duke Frederick steps aside LE BEAU Monsieur the challenger the Princess calls for you ORLANDO I attend them with all respect and duty ROSALIND Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler ORLANDO No fair princess He is the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth CELIA Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years You have seen cruel proof of this mans strength If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt ROSALIND Do young sir Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward ORLANDO I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty ROSALIND The little strength that I have I would it were with you CELIA And mine to eke out hers ROSALIND Fare you well Pray heaven I be deceived in you CELIA Your hearts desires be with you CHARLES Come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ORLANDO Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working DUKE FREDERICK You shall try but one fall CHARLES No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first ORLANDO You mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before But come your ways ROSALIND Now Hercules be thy speed young man CELIA I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg Orlando and Charles wrestle ROSALIND O excellent young man CELIA If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down Charles is thrown Shout DUKE FREDERICK No more no more ORLANDO Yes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathed DUKE FREDERICK How dost thou Charles LE BEAU He cannot speak my lord DUKE FREDERICK Bear him away Charles is carried off by Attendants What is thy name young man ORLANDO Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys DUKE FREDERICK I would thou hadst been son to some man else The world esteemed thy father honourable But I did find him still mine enemy Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house But"

Enter Valentine and Proteus VALENTINE Cease to persuade my loving Proteus Homekeeping youth have ever homely wits Weret not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honoured love I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad Than living dully sluggardized at home Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness But since thou lovst love still and thrive therein Even as I would when I to love begin PROTEUS Wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel Wish me partaker in

love For he was more than over shoes in love VALENTINE Tis true for you are over boots in love And yet you never swam the Hellespont PROTEUS Over the boots Nay give me not the boots VALENTINE No I will not for it boots thee not PROTEUS What VALENTINE To be in love where scorn is bought with groans Coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moments mirth With twenty watchful weary tedious nights

twere best pound you SPEED Nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter PROTEUS You mistake I mean the pound a pinfold SPEED From a pound to a pin Fold it over and over Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover PROTEUS But what said she SPEED Nods his head Ay PROTEUS NodAy Why thats noddy SPEED You mistook sir I say she did nod and you ask me if she

Julia and Lucetta JULIA But say Lucetta now we are alone Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love LUCETTA Ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully JULIA Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me In thy opinion which is worthiest love LUCETTA Please you repeat their names Ill show my mind According to my shallow simple skill JULIA What thinkst thou of the fair Sir Eglamour LUCETTA As of a knight wellspoken neat and fine But were I you he never should be mine JULIA What thinkst thou of the rich Mercatio LUCETTA Well of his wealth but of himself soso JULIA What thinkst thou of the gentle Proteus LUCETTA Lord Lord to see what folly reigns in us JULIA How now What means this passion at his name LUCETTA Pardon dear madam tis a passing shame That I unworthy body as I am Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen JULIA Why not on Proteus as of all the rest LUCETTA Then thus of many good I think him best JULIA Your reason LUCETTA I have no other but a womans reason I think him so because I think him so JULIA And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him LUCETTA Ay if you thought your love not cast away JULIA Why he of all the rest hath never moved me LUCETTA Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye JULIA His little speaking shows his love but small LUCETTA Fire thats closest kept burns most of all JULIA They do not love that do not show their love LUCETTA O they love least that let men know their love JULIA I would I knew his mind LUCETTA Peruse this paper madam Gives her a letter JULIA To JuliaSay from whom LUCETTA That the contents will show JULIA Say say who gave it theeLUCETTA Sir Valentines page and sent I think from Proteus He would have given it you but I being in the way Did in your name receive it Pardon the fault I pray JULIA Now by my modesty a goodly broker Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines To whisper and conspire against my youth Now trust me tis an office of great worth And you an officer fit for the place There take the paper see it be returned Or else return no more into my sight LUCETTA To plead for love deserves more fee than hate JULIA Will ye be gone LUCETTA That you may ruminate Exit JULIA And yet I would I had oerlooked the letter It were a shame to call her back again And pray her to a fault for which I chid her What fool is she that knows I am a maid And would not force the letter to my view Since maids in modesty say No to that Which they would have the profferer construe Ay Fie fie how wayward is this foolish love That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse And presently all humbled kiss the rod How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence When willingly I would have had her here How angerly I taught my brow to frown When inward joy enforced my heart to smile My penance is to call Lucetta back And ask remission for my folly past What ho Lucetta Enter Lucetta LUCETTA What would your ladyship JULIA Is t near dinner time LUCETTA I would it were That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maid Drops and picks up the letter JULIA What ist that you took up so gingerly LUCETTA Nothing JULIA Why didst thou stoop then LUCETTA To take a paper up that I let fall JULIA And is that paper nothing LUCETTA Nothing concerning me JULIA Then let it lie for those that it concerns LUCETTA Madam it will not lie where it concerns Unless it have a false interpreter JULIA Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme LUCETTA That I might sing it madam to a tune Give me a note Your ladyship can set JULIA As little by such toys as may be possible Best sing it to the tune of Light o Love LUCETTA It is too heavy for so light a tune JULIA Heavy Belike it hath some burden then LUCETTA Ay and melodious were it would you sing it JULIA And why not you LUCETTA I cannot reach so high JULIA Lets see your song Taking the letter How now minion LUCETTA Keep tune there still so you will sing it out And yet methinks I do not like this tune JULIA You do not LUCETTA No madam it is too sharp JULIA You minion are too saucy LUCETTA Nay now you are too flat And mar the concord with too harsh a descant There wanteth but a mean to fill your song JULIA The mean is drowned with your unruly bass LUCETTA Indeed I bid the base for Proteus JULIA This babble shall not henceforth trouble me Here is a coil with protestation Tears the letter Go get you gone and let the papers lie You would be fingering them to anger me LUCETTA She makes it strange but she would be best pleased To be so angered with another letter Exit JULIA Nay would I were so angered with the same O hateful hands to tear such loving words Injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings Ill kiss each several paper for amends Look here is writ kind Julia Unkind Julia As in revenge of thy ingratitude I throw thy name against the bruising stones Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain And here is writ lovewounded Proteus Poor wounded name my bosom as a bed Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss But twice or thrice was Proteus written down Be calm good wind blow not a word away Till I have found each letter in the letter Except mine own name That some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged fearful hanging rock And throw it thence into the raging sea Lo here in one line is his name twice writ Poor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus To the sweet Julia That Ill tear away And yet I will not sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names Thus will I fold them one upon another Now kiss embrace contend do what you will Enter Lucetta LUCETTA Madam dinner is ready and your father stays JULIA Well let us go LUCETTA What shall these papers lie like telltales here JULIA If you respect them best to take them up LUCETTA Nay I was taken up for laying them down Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold Picks up pieces of the letter JULIA I see you have a months mind to them LUCETTA Ay madam you may say what sights you see I see things too although you judge I wink JULIA Come come willt please you go Exeunt SCENE III The same A room in Antonios house Enter Antonio and Pantino ANTONIO Tell me Pantino what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister PANTINO Twas of his nephew Proteus your son ANTONIO Why what of him PANTINO He wondered that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home While other men of slender reputation Put forth their sons to seek preferment out Some to the wars to try their fortune there Some to discover islands far away Some to the studious universities For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home Which would be great impeachment to his age In having known no travel in his youth ANTONIO Nor needst thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering I have considered well his loss of time And how he cannot be a perfect man Not being tried and tutored in the world Experience is by industry achieved And perfected by the swift course of time Then tell me whither were I best to send him PANTINO I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion youthful Valentine Attends the Emperor in his royal court ANTONIO I know it well PANTINO Twere good I think your lordship sent him thither There shall he practise tilts and tournaments Hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth ANTONIO I like thy counsel well hast thou advised And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it The execution of it shall make known Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the Emperors court PANTINO Tomorrow may it please you Don Alphonso With other gentlemen of good esteem Are journeying to salute the Emperor And to commend their service to his will ANTONIO Good company With them shall Proteus go Enter Proteus reading a letter And in good time Now will we break with him PROTEUS Sweet love sweet lines sweet life Here is her hand the agent of her heart Here is her oath for love her honours pawn O that our fathers would applaud our loves To seal our happiness with their consents O heavenly Julia ANTONIO How now What letter are you reading there PROTEUS Mayt please your lordship tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine Delivered by a friend that came from him ANTONIO Lend me the letter Let me see what news PROTEUS There is no news my lord but that he writes How happily he lives how well beloved And daily graced by the Emperor Wishing me with him partner of his fortune ANTONIO And how stand you affected to his wish PROTEUS As one relying on your lordships will And not depending on his friendly wish ANTONIO My will is something sorted with his wish Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed For what I will I will and there an end I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the Emperors court What maintenance he from his friends receives Like exhibition thou shalt have from me Tomorrow be in readiness to go Excuse it not for I am peremptory PROTEUS My lord I cannot be so soon provided Please you deliberate a day or two ANTONIO Look what thou wantst shall be sent after thee No more of stay Tomorrow thou must go Come on Pantino you shall be employed To hasten on his expedition Exeunt Antonio and Pantino PROTEUS Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning And drenched me in the sea where I am drowned I feared to show my father Julias letter Lest he should take exceptions to my love And with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love O how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day Which now shows all the beauty of the sun And by an by a cloud takes all away Enter Pantino PANTINO Sir Proteus your father calls for you He is in haste Therefore I pray you go PROTEUS Why this it is my heart accords thereto And yet a thousand times it answers No Exeunt ACT II SCENE I Milan A room in the Dukes palace Enter Valentine and Speed SPEED Sir your glove VALENTINE Not mine My gloves are on SPEED

was last chidden for being too slow VALENTINE Go to sir Tell me do you know Madam Silvia SPEED She that your worship loves VALENTINE Why how know you that I am in love SPEED Marry by these special marks first you have learned like Sir Proteus to wreathe your arms like a malcontent to relish a lovesong like a robin redbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his ABC to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas You were wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walked to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you looked sadly it was for want of money And now you are metamorphosed with a mistress that when I look on you I can hardly think you my master VALENTINE Are all these things perceived in me SPEED They are all perceived without ye VALENTINE Without me They cannot SPEED Without you Nay thats certain for without you were so simple none else would But you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady VALENTINE But tell me dost thou know my lady Silvia SPEED She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper VALENTINE

not in a lovediscourse VALENTINE Ay Proteus but that life is altered now I have done penance for contemning Love Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me With bitter fasts with penitential groans With nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs For in revenge of my contempt of love Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes And made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow O gentle Proteus Loves a mighty lord And hath so humbled me as I confess There is no woe to his correction Nor to his service no such joy on earth Now no discourse except it be of love Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep Upon the very naked name of love PROTEUS Enough I read your fortune in your eye Was this the idol that you worship so VALENTINE Even she and is she not a heavenly saint PROTEUS No but she is an earthly paragon VALENTINE Call her divine PROTEUS I will not flatter her VALENTINE O flatter me for love delights in praises PROTEUS When I was sick you gave me bitter pills And I must minister the like to you VALENTINE Then speak the truth by her if not divine Yet let her be a principality Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth PROTEUS Except my mistress VALENTINE Sweet except not any Except thou wilt except against my love PROTEUS Have I not reason to prefer mine own VALENTINE And I will help thee to prefer her too She shall be dignified with this high honour To bear my ladys train lest the base earth Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss And of so great a favour growing proud Disdain to root the summerswelling flower And make rough winter everlastingly PROTEUS Why Valentine what braggartism is this VALENTINE Pardon me Proteus all I can is nothing To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing She is alone PROTEUS Then let her alone VALENTINE Not for the world Why man she is mine own And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl The water nectar and the rocks pure gold Forgive me that I do not dream on thee Because thou seest me dote upon my love My foolish rival that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge Is gone with her along and I must after For love thou knowst is full of jealousy PROTEUS But she loves you VALENTINE Ay and we are betrothed nay more our marriage hour With all the cunning manner of our flight Determined of how I must climb her window The ladder made of cords and all the means Plotted and greed on for my happiness Good Proteus go with me to my chamber In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel PROTEUS Go on before I shall enquire you forth I must unto the road to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use And then Ill presently attend you VALENTINE Will you make haste PROTEUS I will Exit Valentine Even as one heat another heat expels Or as one nail by strength drives out another So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten Is it mine eye or Valentines praise Her true perfection or my false transgression That makes me reasonless to reason thus She is fair and so is Julia that I love That I did love for now my love is thawed Which like a waxen image gainst a fire Bears no impression of the thing it was Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold And that I love him not as I was wont O but I love his lady too too much And thats the reason I love him so little How shall I dote on her with more advice That thus without advice begin to love her Tis but her picture I have yet beheld And that hath dazzled my reasons light But when I look on her perfections There is no reason but I shall be blind If I can check my erring love I will If not to compass her Ill use my skill Exit SCENE V The same A street Enter Speed and Lance with his dog Crab SPEED Lance by mine honesty welcome to Milan LANCE Forswear

Petruchio should be married And yet we hear not of our soninlaw What will be said What mockery will it be To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage What says Lucentio to this shame of ours KATHERINA No shame but mine I must forsooth be forcd To give my hand opposd against my heart Unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen Who wood in haste and means to wed at leisure I told you I he was a frantic fool Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour And to be noted for a merry man Hell woo a thousand point the day of marriage Make friends invite and proclaim the banns Yet never means to wed where he hath wood Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say Lo there is mad Petruchios wife If it would please him come and marry her TRANIO

of Petruchios coming BAPTISTA Is he come BIONDELLO Why no sir BAPTISTA What then BIONDELLO He is coming BAPTISTA When will he be here BIONDELLO When he stands where I am and sees you there TRANIO But say what to thine old news BIONDELLO Why Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair of boots that have been candlecases one buckled another laced an old rusty sword taen out of the town armoury with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten nearlegged before and with a halfchecked bit and a headstall of sheeps leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six times pieced and a womans crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthread BAPTISTA Who comes with him BIONDELLO O sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies prickd int for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian footboy or a gentlemans lackey TRANIO Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion Yet oftentimes he goes but meanapparelld BAPTISTA I am glad hes come howsoeer he comes BIONDELLO Why sir he comes not BAPTISTA Didst thou not say he comes BIONDELLO Who that Petruchio came BAPTISTA Ay that Petruchio came BIONDELLO No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back BAPTISTA Why thats all one BIONDELLO Nay by Saint Jamy I hold you a penny A horse and a man

Now sadder that you come so unprovided Fie doff this habit shame to your estate An eyesore to our solemn festival TRANIO And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detaind you from your wife And sent you hither so unlike yourself PETRUCHIO Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear Sufficeth I am come to keep my word Though in some part enforced to digress Which at more leisure I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal But where is Kate I stay too long from her The morning wears tis time we were at church TRANIO See not your bride in these unreverent robes Go to my chamber put on clothes of mine PETRUCHIO Not I believe me thus Ill visit her BAPTISTA But thus I trust you will not marry her PETRUCHIO Good sooth even thus therefore ha done with words To me shes married not unto my clothes Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements Twere well for Kate and better for myself But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss Exeunt Petruchio Grumio and Biondello TRANIO He hath some meaning in his mad attire We will persuade him be it possible To put on better ere he go to church BAPTISTA Ill after him and see the event of this Exeunt Baptista Gremio and Attendants TRANIO But sir to love concerneth us to add Her fathers liking which to bring to

than I have promised So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent LUCENTIO Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Biancas steps so narrowly Twere good methinks to steal our marriage Which once performd let all the world say no Ill keep mine own despite of all the world TRANIO That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business Well overreach the greybeard Gremio The narrowprying father Minola The quaint musician amorous Licio All for my masters sake Lucentio Reenter Gremio Signior Gremio came you from the church GREMIO As willingly as eer I came from school TRANIO And is the bride and bridegroom coming home GREMIO A bridegroom say you Tis a groom indeed A grumbling groom and that the girl shall find TRANIO Curster than she Why tis impossible GREMIO Why hes a devil a devil a very fiend TRANIO Why shes a devil a devil the devils dam GREMIO Tut shes a lamb a dove a fool to him Ill tell you Sir Lucentio when the priest Should ask if Katherine should be his wife Ay by gogswouns quoth he and swore so loud That all amazd the priest let fall the book And as he stoopd again to take it up The madbraind bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book and book and priest Now take them up quoth he if any list TRANIO What said the wench when he rose again GREMIO Trembled and shook for why he stampd and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him But after many ceremonies done He calls for wine A health quoth he as if He had been abroad carousing to his mates After a storm quaffd off the muscadel And threw the sops all in the sextons face Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seemd to ask him sops as he was drinking This done he took the bride about the neck And kissd her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo And I seeing this came thence for very shame And after me I know the rout is coming Such a mad marriage never was before Hark hark I hear the minstrels play Music plays Enter Petruchio Katherina Bianca Baptista Hortensio Grumio and Train PETRUCHIO Gentlemen and friends I thank you for your pains I know you think to dine with me today And have prepard great store of wedding cheer But so it is my haste doth call me hence And therefore here I mean to take my leave BAPTISTA Ist possible you will away tonight PETRUCHIO I

noble MartiusBRUTUS Hes a lamb indeed that baas like a bear MENENIUS Hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb You two are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you BOTH TRIBUNES Well sir MENENIUS In what enormity is Martius poor in that you two have not in abundance BRUTUS Hes poor in no one fault but stored with all SICINIUS Especially in pride BRUTUS And topping all others in boasting MENENIUS This is strange now Do you two know how you are censured here in the city I mean of us o th righthand file do you BOTH TRIBUNES Why how are we censured MENENIUS Because you talk of pride now will you not be angry BOTH TRIBUNES Well well sir well MENENIUS Why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame Martius for being proud BRUTUS We do it not alone sir MENENIUS I know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single Your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone You talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of

said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning

cannot say your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables And though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces If you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough too BRUTUS Come sir come we know you well enough MENENIUS You know neither me yourselves nor anything You are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and a faucetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves You are a pair of strange ones BRUTUS Come come You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss packsaddle Yet you must be saying Martius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen Good een to your Worships More of your

oaths He had sworn to marry me When his wifes dead therefore Ill lie with him When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid Marry that will I live and die a maid Only in this disguise I thinkt no sin

intelligence FIRST LORD Ay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verity SECOND LORD I am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this FIRST LORD How mightily

with his hand That it beguiled attention charmed the sight In speech it seemed his beard all silver white Wagged up and down and from his lips did fly Thin winding breath which purled up to the sky About him were a press of gaping faces Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice All jointly listning but with several graces As if some mermaid did their ears entice Some high some low the painter was so nice The scalps of many almost hid behind To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind Here one mans hand leaned on anothers head His nose being shadowed by his neighbours ear Here one being thronged bears back all bolln and red Another smothered seems to pelt and swear And in their rage such signs of rage they bear As but for loss of Nestors golden words It seemed they would debate with angry swords For much imaginary work was there Conceit deceitful so compact so kind That for Achilles image stood his spear Griped in an armed hand himself behind Was left unseen save to the eye of mind A hand a foot a face a leg a head Stood for the whole to be imagined And from the walls of strongbesieged Troy When their brave hope bold Hector marched to field Stood many Trojan mothers sharing joy To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield And to their hope they such odd action yield That through their light joy seemed to appear Like bright things stained a kind of heavy fear And from the strand of Dardan where they fought To Simois reedy banks the red blood ran Whose waves to imitate the battle sought With swelling ridges and their ranks began To break upon the galled shore and then Retire again till meeting greater ranks They join and shoot their foam at Simois banks To this wellpainted piece is Lucrece come To find a face where all distress is stelled Many she sees where cares have carved some But none where all distress and dolour dwelled Till she despairing Hecuba beheld Staring on Priams wounds with her old eyes Which bleeding under Pyrrhus proud foot lies In her the painter had anatomized Times ruin beautys wrack and grim cares reign Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised Of what she was no semblance did remain Her blue blood changed to black in every vein Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed Showed life imprisoned in a body dead On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes And shapes her sorrow to the beldams woes Who nothing wants to answer her but cries And bitter words to ban her cruel foes The painter was no god to lend her those And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong To give her so much grief and not a tongue Poor instrument quoth she without a sound Ill tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue And drop sweet balm in Priams painted wound And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies Show me the strumpet that began this stir That with my nails her beauty I may tear Thy heat of lust fond Paris did incur This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here And here in Troy for trespass of thine eye The sire the son the dame and daughter die Why should the private pleasure of some one Become the public plague of many moe Let sin alone committed light alone Upon his head that hath transgressed so Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe For ones offence why should so many fall To plague a private sin in general Lo here weeps Hecuba here Priam dies Here manly Hector faints here Troilus swounds Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds And one mans lust these many lives confounds Had doting Priam checked his sons desire Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire Here feelingly she weeps Troys painted woes For sorrow like a heavyhanging bell Once set on ringing with his own weight goes Then little strength rings out the doleful knell So Lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow She lends them words and she their looks doth borrow She throws her eyes about the painting round And who she finds forlorn she doth lament At last she sees a wretched image bound That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent His face though full of cares yet showed content Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes So mild that patience seemed to scorn his woes In him the painter laboured with his skill To hide deceit and give the harmless show An humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe Cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so That blushing red no guilty instance gave Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have But like a constant and confirmed devil He entertained a show so seeming just And therein so ensconced his secret evil That jealousy itself could not mistrust Falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such blackfaced storms Or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms The wellskilled workman this mild image drew For perjured Sinon whose enchanting story The credulous Old Priam after slew Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory Of richbuilt Ilion that the skies were sorry And little stars shot from their fixed places When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces This picture she advisedly perused And chid the painter for his wondrous skill Saying some shape in Sinons was abused So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill And still on him she gazed and gazing still Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied That she concludes the picture was belied It cannot be quoth she that so much guile She would have said can lurk in such a look But Tarquins shape came in her mind the while And from her tongue can lurk from cannot took It cannot be she in that sense forsook And turned it thus It cannot be I find But such a face should bear a wicked mind For even as subtle Sinon here is painted So sobersad so weary and so mild As if with grief or travail he had fainted To me came Tarquin armed too beguiled With outward honesty but yet defiledWith inward vice As Priam him did cherish So did I Tarquin so my Troy did perish Look look how listening Priam wets his eyes To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds Priam why art thou old and yet not wise For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds His eye drops fire no water thence proceeds Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city Such devils steal effects from lightless hell For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold And in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell These contraries such unity do hold Only to flatter fools and make them bold So Priams trust false Sinons tears doth flatter That he finds means to burn his Troy with water Here all enraged such passion her assails That patience is quite beaten from her breast She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails Comparing him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself detest At last she smilingly with this gives oer Fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow And time doth weary time with her complaining She looks for night and then she longs for morrow And both she thinks too long with her remaining Short time seems long in sorrows sharp sustaining Though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps And they that watch see time how slow it creeps Which all this time hath overslipped her thought That she with painted images hath spent Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep surmise of others detriment Losing her woes in shows of discontent It easeth some though none it ever cured To think their dolour others have endured But now the mindful messenger come back Brings home his lord and other company Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black And round about her teardistained eye Blue circles streamed like rainbows in the sky These watergalls in her dim element Foretell new storms to those already spent Which when her sadbeholding husband saw Amazedly in her sad face he stares Her eyes though sod in tears looked red and raw Her lively colour killed with deadly cares He hath no power to ask her how she fares Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance Met far from home wondring each others chance At last he takes her by the bloodless hand And thus begins What uncouth ill event Hath thee befalln that thou dost trembling stand Sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent Why art thou thus attired in discontent Unmask dear dear this moody heaviness And tell thy grief that we may give redress Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire Ere once she can discharge one word of woe At length addressed to answer his desire She modestly prepares to let them know Her honour is taen prisoner by the foe While Collatine and his consorted lords With sad attention long to hear her words And now this pale swan in her watry nest Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending Few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best Where no excuse can give the fault amending In me more woes than words are now depending And my laments would be drawn out too long To tell them all with one poor tired tongue Then be this all the task it hath to say Dear husband in the interest of thy bed A stranger came and on that pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head And what wrong else may be imagined By foul enforcement might be done to me From that alas thy Lucrece is not free For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight With shining falchion in my chamber came A creeping creature with a flaming light And softly cried Awake thou Roman dame And entertain my love else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will inflict If thou my loves desire do contradict For some hardfavoured groom of thine quoth he Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will Ill murder straight and then Ill slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsome act of lust and so did kill The lechers in their deed This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy With this I did begin to start and cry And then against my heart he sets his sword Swearing unless I took all patiently I should not live to speak another word So should my shame still rest upon record And never be forgot in mighty Rome The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom Mine enemy was strong my poor self weak And far the weaker with so strong a fear My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak No rightful plea might plead for justice there His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies O teach me how to make mine own excuse Or at the least this refuge let me find Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse Immaculate and spotless is my mind That was not forced that never was inclined To accessary yieldings but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure Lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss With head declined and voice dammed up with woe With sad set eyes and wretched arms across From lips newwaxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so But wretched as he is he strives in vain What he breathes out his breath drinks up again As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast In rage sent out recalled in rage being past Even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw To push grief on and back the same grief draw Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh Dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth Another power no flood by raining slaketh My woe too sensible thy passion maketh More feelingpainful Let it then suffice To drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes And for my sake when I might charm thee so For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me Be suddenly revenged on my foe Thine mine his own Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late yet let the traitor die For sparing justice feeds iniquity But ere I name him you fair lords quoth she Speaking to those that came with Collatine Shall plight your honourable faiths to me With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine For tis a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms Knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms At this request with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid As bound in knighthood to her imposition Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed But she that yet her sad task hath not said The protestation stops O speak quoth she How may this forced stain be wiped from me What is the quality of my offence Being constrained with dreadful circumstance May my pure mind with the foul act dispense My lowdeclined honour to advance May any terms acquit me from this chance The poisoned fountain clears itself again And why not I from this compelled stain With this they all at once began to say Her bodys stain her mind untainted clears While with a joyless smile she turns away The face that map which deep impression bears Of hard misfortune carved in it with tears No no quoth she no dame hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuses giving Here with a sigh as if her heart would break She throws forth Tarquins name He he she says But more than he her poor tongue could not speak Till after many accents and delays Untimely breathings sick and short assays She utters this He he fair lords tis he That guides this hand to give this wound to me Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast A harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed That blow did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted prison where it breathed Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed Her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly Lifes lasting date from cancelled destiny Stonestill astonished with this deadly deed Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew Till Lucrece father that beholds her bleed Himself on her selfslaughtered body threw And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murdrous knife and as it left the place Her blood in poor revenge held it in chase And bubbling from her breast it doth divide In two slow rivers that the crimson blood Circles her body in on every side Who like a latesacked island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood Some of her blood still pure and red remained And some looked black and that false Tarquin stained About the mourning and congealed face Of that black blood a watry rigol goes Which seems to weep upon the tainted place And ever since as pitying Lucrece woes Corrupted blood some watery token shows And blood untainted still doth red abide Blushing at that which is so putrified Daughter dear daughter old Lucretius cries That life was mine which thou hast here deprived If in the child the fathers image lies Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived Thou wast not to this end from me derived If children predecease progenitors We are their offspring and they none of ours Poor broken glass I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born But now that fair fresh mirror dim and old Shows me a bareboned death by time outworn O from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn And shivered all the beauty of my glass That I no more can see what once I was O time cease thou thy course and last no longer If they surcease to be that should survive Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger And leave the faltring feeble souls alive The old bees die the young possess their hive Then live sweet Lucrece live again and see Thy father die and not thy father thee By this starts Collatine as from a dream And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place And then in keycold Lucrece bleeding stream He falls and bathes the pale fear in his face And counterfeits to die with her a space Till manly shame bids him possess his breath And live to be revenged on her death The deep vexation of his inward soul Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue Who mad that sorrow should his use control Or keep him from hearteasing words so long Begins to talk but through his lips do throng Weak words so thick come in his poor hearts aid That no man could distinguish what he said Yet sometime Tarquin was pronounced plain But through his teeth as if the name he toreThis windy tempest till it blow up rain Held back his sorrows tide to make it more At last it rains and busy winds give oer Then son and father weep with equal strife Who should weep most for daughter or for wife The one doth call her his the other his Yet neither may possess the claim they lay The father says Shes mine O mine she is Replies her husband Do not take away My sorrows interest let no mourner say He weeps for her for she was only mine And only must be wailed by Collatine O quoth Lucretius I did give that life Which she too early and too late hath spilled Woe woe quoth Collatine she was my wife I owed her and tis mine that she hath killed My daughter and my wife with clamours filled The dispersed air who holding Lucrece life Answered their cries my daughter and my wife Brutus who plucked the knife from Lucrece side Seeing such emulation in their woe Began to clothe his wit in state and pride Burying in Lucrece wound his follys show He with the Romans was esteemed so As silly jeering idiots are with kings For sportive words and uttring foolish things But now he throws that shallow habit by Wherein deep policy did him disguise And armed his longhid wits advisedly To check the tears in Collatinus eyes Thou wronged lord of Rome quoth he arise Let my unsounded self supposed a fool Now set thy longexperienced wit to school Why Collatine is woe the cure for woe Do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds Is it revenge to give thyself a blow For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so To slay herself that should have slain her foe Courageous Roman do not steep thy heart In such relenting dew of lamentations But kneel with me and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with invocations That they will suffer these abominations Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased Now by the Capitol that we adore And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained By heavens fair sun that breeds the fat earths store By all our country rights in Rome maintained And by chaste Lucrece soul that late complained Her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife We will revenge the death of this true wife This said he struck his hand upon his breast And kissed the fatal knife to end his vow And to his protestation urged the rest Who wondring at him did his words allow Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow And that deep vow which Brutus made before He doth again repeat and that they swore When they had sworn to this advised doom They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence To show her bleeding body thorough Rome And so to publish Tarquins foul offence Which being done with speedy diligence The Romans plausibly did give consent To Tarquins everlasting banishment VENUS AND ADONIS Vilia miretur vulgus mihi flavus Apollo Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON and Baron of Titchfield Right Honourable I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your lordship nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen only if your honour seem but pleased I account myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of all idle hours till I have honoured you with some graver labour But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather and never after ear so barren a land for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest I leave it to your honourable survey and your honour to your hearts content which I wish may always answer your own wish and the worlds hopeful expectation Your honours in all duty WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE VENUS AND ADONIS Even as the sun with purplecolourd face Had taen his last leave of the weeping morn Rosecheekd Adonis hied him to the chase Hunting he lovd but love he laughd to scorn 4 Sickthoughted Venus makes amain unto him And like a boldfacd suitor gins to woo him Thrice fairer than myself thus she began The fields chief flower sweet above compare 8 Stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man More white and red than doves or roses are Nature that made thee with herself at strife Saith that the world hath ending with thy life 12 Vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed And rein his proud head to the saddlebow If thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know 16 Here come and sit where never serpent hisses And being set Ill smother thee with kisses And yet not cloy thy lips with loathd satiety But rather famish them amid their plenty 20 Making them red and pale with fresh variety Ten kisses short as one one long as twenty A summers day will seem an hour but short Being wasted in such timebeguiling sport 24 With this she seizeth on his sweating palm The precedent of pith and livelihood And trembling in her passion calls it balm Earths sovereign salve to do a goddess good 28 Being so enragd desire doth lend her force Courageously to pluck him from his horse Over one arm the lusty coursers rein Under her other was the tender boy 32 Who blushd and pouted in a dull disdain With leaden appetite unapt to toy She red and hot as coals of glowing fire He red for shame but frosty in desire 36 The studded bridle on a ragged bough Nimbly she fastensO how quick is love The steed is stalled up and even now To tie the rider she begins to prove 40 Backward she pushd him as she would be thrust And governd him in strength though not in lust So soon was she along as he was down Each leaning on their elbows and their hips 44 Now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown And gins to chide but soon she stops his lips And kissing speaks with lustful language broken If thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open 48 He burns with bashful shame she with her tears Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs To fan and blow them dry again she seeks 52 He saith she is immodest blames her miss What follows more she murders with a kiss Even as an empty eagle sharp by fast Tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone 56 Shaking her wings devouring all in haste Till either gorge be stuffd or prey be gone Even so she kissd his brow his cheek his chin And where she ends she doth anew begin 60 Forcd to content but never to obey Panting he lies and breatheth in her face She feedeth on the steam as on a prey And calls it heavenly moisture air of grace 64 Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers So they were dewd with such distilling showers Look how a bird lies tangled in a net So fastend in her arms Adonis lies 68 Pure shame and awd resistance made him fret Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes Rain added to a river that is rank Perforce will force it overflow the bank 72 Still she entreats and prettily entreats For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale Still is he sullen still he lours and frets Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale 76 Being red she loves him best and being white Her best is betterd with a more delight Look how he can she cannot choose but love And by her fair immortal hand she swears 80 From his soft bosom never to remove Till he take truce with her contending tears Which long have raind making her cheeks all wet And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt Upon this promise did he raise his chin 85 Like a divedapper peering through a wave Who being lookd on ducks as quickly in So offers he to give what she did crave 88 But when her lips were ready for his pay He winks and turns his lips another way Never did passenger in summers heat More thirst for drink than she for this good turn 92 Her help she sees but help she cannot get She bathes in water yet her fire must burn O pity gan she cry flinthearted boy Tis but a kiss I beg why art thou coy 96 I have been wood as I entreat thee now Even by the stern and direful god of war Whose sinewy neck in battle neer did bow Who conquers where he comes in every jar 100 Yet hath he been my captive and my slave And beggd for that which thou unaskd shalt have Over my altars hath he hung his lance His batterd shield his uncontrolled crest 104 And for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance To toy to wanton dally smile and jest Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red Making my arms his field his tent my bed 108 Thus he that overruld I overswayd Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain Strongtemperd steel his stronger strength obeyd Yet was he servile to my coy disdain 112 Oh be not proud nor brag not of thy might For mastring her that foild the god of fight Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine Though mine be not so fair yet are they red 116 The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine What seest thou in the ground hold up thy head Look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies Then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes 120 Art thou ashamd to kiss then wink again And I will wink so shall the day seem night Love keeps his revels where there are but twain Be bold to play our sport is not in sight 124 These blueveind violets whereon we lean Never can blab nor know not what we mean The tender spring upon thy tempting lip 127 Shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted Make use of time let not advantage slip Beauty within itself should not be wasted Fair flowers that are not gatherd in their prime Rot and consume themselves in little time 132 Were I hardfavourd foul or wrinkled old Illnurturd crooked churlish harsh in voice Oerworn despised rheumatic and cold Thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice 136 Then mightst thou pause for then I were not for thee But having no defects why dost abhor me Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow 139 Mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow My flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning My smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt Would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt 144 Bid me discourse I will enchant thine ear Or like a fairy trip upon the green Or like a nymph with long dishevelld hair Dance on the sands and yet no footing seen 148 Love is a spirit all compact of fire Not gross to sink but light and will aspire Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie 151These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky From morn till night even where I list to sport me Is love so light sweet boy and may it be That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee 156 Is thine own heart to thine own face affected Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left Then woo thyself be of thyself rejected Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft 160 Narcissus so himself himself forsook And died to kiss his shadow in the brook Torches are made to light jewels to wear Dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use 164 Herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear Things growing to themselves are growths abuse Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty Thou wast begot to get it is thy duty 168 Upon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed Unless the earth with thy increase be fed By law of nature thou art bound to breed That thine may live when thou thyself art dead 172 And so in spite of death thou dost survive In that thy likeness still is left alive By this the lovesick queen began to sweat For where they lay the shadow had forsook them 176 And Titan tired in the midday heat With burning eye did hotly overlook them Wishing Adonis had his team to guide So he were like him and by Venus side 180 And now Adonis with a lazy spright And with a heavy dark disliking eye His louring brows oerwhelming his fair sight Like misty vapours when they blot the sky 184 Souring his cheeks cries Fie no more of love The sun doth burn my face I must remove Ay me quoth Venus young and so unkind What bare excuses makst thou to be gone 188 Ill sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind Shall cool the heat of this descending sun Ill make a shadow for thee of my hairs If they burn too Ill quench them with my tears 192 The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm And lo I lie between that sun and thee The heat I have from thence doth little harm Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me 196 And were I not immortal life were done Between this heavenly and earthly sun Art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel Nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth 200 Art thou a womans son and canst not feel What tis to love how want of love tormenteth O had thy mother borne so hard a mind She had not brought forth thee but died unkind 204 What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this Or what great danger dwells upon my suit What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss Speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute 208 Give me one kiss Ill give it thee again And one for intrest if thou wilt have twain Fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone Wellpainted idol image dull and dead 212 Statue contenting but the eye alone Thing like a man but of no woman bred Thou art no man though of a mans complexion For men will kiss even by their own direction 216 This said impatience chokes her pleading tongue And swelling passion doth provoke a pause Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong Being judge in love she cannot right her cause 220 And now she weeps and now she fain would speak And now her sobs do her intendments break Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand Now gazeth she on him now on the ground 224 Sometimes her arms infold him like a band She would he will not in her arms be bound And when from thence he struggles to be gone She locks her lily fingers one in one 228 Fondling she saith since I have hemmd thee here Within the circuit of this ivory pale Ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer Feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 232 Graze on my lips and if those hills be dry Stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie Within this limit is relief enough Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain 236 Round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough To shelter thee from tempest and from rain Then be my deer since I am such a park 239 No dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark At this Adonis smiles as in disdain That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple Love made those hollows if himself were slain He might be buried in a tomb so simple 244 Foreknowing well if there he came to lie Why there love livd and there he could not die These lovely caves these round enchanting pits Opend their mouths to swallow Venus liking 248 Being mad before how doth she now for wits Struck dead at first what needs a second striking Poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn 252 Now which way shall she turn what shall she say Her words are done her woes the more increasing The time is spent her object will away And from her twining arms doth urge releasing 256 Pity she cries some favour some remorse Away he springs and hasteth to his horse But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by A breeding jennet lusty young and proud 260 Adonis tramping courser doth espy And forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud The strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he 264 Imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds And now his woven girths he breaks asunder The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds Whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder The iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth 269 Controlling what he was controlled with His ears upprickd his braided hanging mane Upon his compassd crest now stand on end 272 His nostrils drink the air and forth again As from a furnace vapours doth he send His eye which scornfully glisters like fire Shows his hot courage and his high desire 276 Sometime he trots as if he told the steps With gentle majesty and modest pride Anon he rears upright curvets and leaps As who should say Lo thus my strength is tried And this I do to captivate the eye 281 Of the fair breeder that is standing by What recketh he his riders angry stir His flattering Holla or his Stand I say 284 What cares he now for curb or pricking spur For rich caparisons or trappings gay He sees his love and nothing else he sees For nothing else with his proud sight agrees 288 Look when a painter would surpass the life In limning out a wellproportiond steed His art with natures workmanship at strife As if the dead the living should exceed 292 So did this horse excel a common one In shape in courage colour pace and bone Roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long Broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide Look what a horse should have he did not lack Save a proud rider on so proud a back 300 Sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares Anon he starts at stirring of a feather To bid the wind a base he now prepares And where he run or fly they know not whether 304 For through his mane and tail the high wind sings Fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings He looks upon his love and neighs unto her She answers him as if she knew his mind 308 Being proud as females are to see him woo her She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels Beating his kind embracements with her heels 312 Then like a melancholy malcontent He vails his tail that like a falling plume Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 316 His love perceiving how he was enragd Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd His testy master goeth about to take him When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear 320 Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him With her the horse and left Adonis there As they were mad unto the wood they hie them Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them 324 All swoln with chafing down Adonis sits Banning his boisterous and unruly beast And now the happy season once more fits That lovesick love by pleading may be blest 328 For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong When it is barrd the aidance of the tongue An oven that is stoppd or river stayd Burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 332 So of concealed sorrow may be said Free vent of words loves fire doth assuage But when the hearts attorney once is mute The client breaks as desperate in his suit 336 He sees her coming and begins to glow Even as a dying coal revives with wind And with his bonnet hides his angry brow Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 340 Taking no notice that she is so nigh For all askance he holds her in his eye O what a sight it was wistly to view How she came stealing to the wayward boy 344 To note the fighting conflict of her hue How white and red each other did destroy But now her cheek was pale and by and by It flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky 348 Now was she just before him as he sat And like a lowly lover down she kneels With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 352 His tendrer cheek receives her soft hands print As apt as newfalln snow takes any dint Oh what a war of looks was then between them Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 356 His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them Her eyes wood still his eyes disdaind the wooing And all this dumb play had his acts made plain With tears which choruslike her eyes did rain Full gently now she takes him by the hand 361 A lily prisond in a gaol of snow Or ivory in an alabaster band So white a friend engirts so white a foe 364 This beauteous combat wilful and unwilling Showd like two silver doves that sit abilling Once more the engine of her thoughts began O fairest mover on this mortal round 368 Would thou wert as I am and I a man My heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee Though nothing but my bodys bane would cure thee Give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it Give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it And being steeld soft sighs can never grave it 376 Then loves deep groans I never shall regard Because Adonis heart hath made mine hard For shame he cries let go and let me go My days delight is past my horse is gone 380 And tis your fault I am bereft him so I pray you hence and leave me here alone For all my mind my thought my busy care Is how to get my palfrey from the mare 384 Thus she replies Thy palfrey as he should Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desireAffection is a coal that must be coold Else sufferd it will set the heart on fire 388 The sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone How like a jade he stood tied to the tree Servilely masterd with a leathern rein 392 But when he saw his love his youths fair fee He held such petty bondage in disdain Throwing the base thong from his bending crest Enfranchising his mouth his back his breast 396 Who sees his truelove in her naked bed Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white But when his glutton eye so full hath fed His other agents aim at like delight 400 Who is so faint that dare not be so bold To touch the fire the weather being cold Let me excuse thy cour"

Lepidus and henceforth know It is not Caesars natural vice to hate Our great competitor From Alexandria This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he hardly gave audience or Vouchsafed to think he had partners You shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults That all men follow LEPIDUS I must not think there are Evils enough to darken all his goodness His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven More fiery by nights blackness hereditary Rather than purchased what he cannot change Than what he chooses CAESAR You are too indulgent Lets grant it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of PtolemyTo give a kingdom for a mirth to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat Say this becomes him As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemishyet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him fort But to confound such time

judgment Enter a Messenger LEPIDUS Heres more news MESSENGER Thy biddings have been done and every hour Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report How tis abroad Pompey is strong at sea And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar To the ports The discontents repair and mens reports Give him much wronged CAESAR I should have known no less It hath been taught us from the primal

name strikes more Than could his war resisted CAESAR Antony Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once Was beaten from Modena where thou slewst Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel Did famine follow whom thou foughtst against Though daintily brought up with patience more Than savages could suffer Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets The barks of trees thou browsed On the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh Which some did die to look on And all this It wounds thine honour that I speak it now Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek So much as lanked not LEPIDUS Tis pity of him CAESAR Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i th field and to that end Assemble we immediate council Pompey Thrives in our idleness LEPIDUS Tomorrow Caesar I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time CAESAR Till which encounter It is my business too Farewell LEPIDUS Farewell my lord What you shall know meantime

Wheres my serpent of old Nile For so he calls me Now I feed myself With most delicious poison Think on me That am with Phbus amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time Broadfronted Caesar When

Is twice the other twain But let us rear The higher our opinion that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypts widow pluck The neer lustwearied Antony MENAS I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together His wife thats dead did trespasses to Caesar His brother warred upon him although I think Not moved by Antony POMPEY I know not Menas How lesser enmities may give way to greater Weret not that we stand up against them all Twere pregnant they should square between themselves For they have entertained cause enough To draw their swords But how the fear of us May cement their divisions

their contestation Was theme for you you were the word of war ANTONY You do mistake your business My brother never Did urge me in his act I did inquire it And have my learning from some true reports

his side and I to peruse him by items PHILARIO You speak of him when he was less furnishd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within FRENCHMAN I have seen him in France we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he IACHIMO This matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I doubt not a great deal from the matter FRENCHMAN And then his banishment IACHIMO Ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgement which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintance PHILARIO His father and I were soldiers together to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life Enter Posthumus Here comes the Briton Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a

nature POSTHUMUS By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller rather shunnd to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others experiences but upon my mended judgement if I offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight FRENCHMAN Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have falln both IACHIMO Can we with manners ask what was the difference FRENCHMAN Safely I think Twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report It was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in FranceIACHIMO That lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this worn out POSTHUMUS She holds her virtue still and I my mind IACHIMO You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy POSTHUMUS Being so far provokd as I was in France I would abate her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend IACHIMO As fair and as gooda kind of handinhand comparisonhad been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours

given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods IACHIMO Which the gods have given you POSTHUMUS Which by their graces I will keep IACHIMO You may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds Your ring may be stoln too So your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a thatwayaccomplishd courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last POSTHUMUS Your Italy contains none so accomplishd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ring PHILARIO Let us leave here gentlemen POSTHUMUS Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first IACHIMO With five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friend POSTHUMUS No no IACHIMO I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion oervalues it something But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any lady in the world POSTHUMUS You are a great deal abusd in too bold a persuasion and I doubt not you sustain what yare worthy of by your attempt IACHIMO Whats that POSTHUMUS A repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too PHILARIO Gentlemen enough of this It came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquainted IACHIMO Would I had put my estate and my neighbours on th approbation of what I have spoke POSTHUMUS What lady would you choose to assail IACHIMO Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where

POSTHUMUS Will you I shall but lend my diamond till your return Let there be covenants drawn betweens My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to this match heres my ring PHILARIO I will have it no lay IACHIMO By the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyd the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too If I come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment POSTHUMUS I embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevaild I am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseducd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and th assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword IACHIMO Your hand a covenant We will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for Britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve I will fetch my gold and

I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I cannot do it Yet Ill hammer it out My brain Ill prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of stillbreeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermixed With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word as thus Come little ones And then again It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a needles eye Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortunes slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I kinged again and by and by Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing But whateer I be Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased With being nothing Music do I hear Music Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept So is it in the music of mens lives And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disordered string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numbring clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dials point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this allhating world Enter a Groom of the stable GROOM Hail royal Prince RICHARD Thanks noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear What art thou and how comest thou hither Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live GROOM I was a poor groom of thy stable king When thou wert king who travelling towards York With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal masters face O how it erned my heart when I beheld In London streets that coronation day When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary That horse that thou so often hast bestrid That horse that I so carefully have dressed RICHARD Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend How went he under him GROOM So proudly as if he disdained the ground RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he not stumble Would he not fall down Since pride must have a fall and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp his back Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee Since thou created to be awed by man Wast born to bear I was not made a horse And yet I bear a burden like an ass Spurred galled and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke Enter Keeper with a dish KEEPER To the Groom Fellow give place Here is

wont to do KEEPER My lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton Who lately came from the King commands the contraryRICHARD The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee Patience is stale and I am weary of it Strikes the Keeper KEEPER Help help help Enter Exton and Servants armed RICHARD How now What means death in this rude assault Villain thy own hand yields thy deaths instrument Snatching a weapon and killing one Go thou and fill another room in hell He kills another then Exton strikes him down That hand shall burn in neverquenching fire That staggers thus my person Exton thy fierce hand Hath with the Kings blood stained the Kings own land Mount mount my soul Thy seat is up on high Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die Dies EXTON As full of valour as of royal blood Both have I spilled O would the deed were good For now the devil that told me I did well Says that this deed is chronicled in hell This dead king to the living king Ill bear Take hence the rest and give them burial here Exeunt SCENE VI Windsor An Apartment in the Castle Flourish Enter King Henry and York with Lords and Attendants KING HENRY Kind uncle York the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have

Carlisle PERCY The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster With clog of conscience and sour melancholy Hath yielded up his body to the grave But here is Carlisle living to abide Thy kingly doom and

For though mine enemy thou hast ever been High sparks of honour in thee have I seen Enter Exton with attendants bearing a coffin EXTON Great king within this coffin I present Thy buried fear Herein all breathless lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought KING HENRY Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous land EXTON From your own mouth my lord did I this deed KING HENRY They love not poison that do poison need Nor do I thee Though I did wish him dead I hate the murderer love him murdered The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour But neither my good word nor princely favour With Cain go wander thorough shades of night And never show thy head by day nor light Lords I protest my soul is full of woe That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow Come mourn with me for what I do lament And put on sullen black incontinent Ill make a voyage to the Holy Land To wash this

Messengers Ghosts Soldiers c SCENE England ACT I SCENE I London A street Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester alone RICHARD Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths Our bruised arms hung up for monuments Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings Our dreadful marches to delightful measures Grimvisaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front And now instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass I that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph I that am curtailed of this fair proportion Cheated of feature by dissembling nature Deformed unfinished sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them Why I in this weak piping time of peace Have no delight to pass away the time Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity And therefore since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair wellspoken days I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days Plots have I laid inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle false and treacherous This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that G Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes Enter Clarence guarded and Brakenbury Brother good day What means this armed guard That waits upon your Grace CLARENCE His Majesty Tendring my persons safety hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower RICHARD Upon what cause CLARENCE Because my name is George RICHARD Alack my lord that fault is none of yours He should for that commit your godfathers O belike his Majesty hath some intent That you should be newchristened in the Tower But whats the matter Clarence May I know CLARENCE Yea Richard when I know for I protest As yet I do not But as I can learn He hearkens after prophecies and dreams And from the crossrow plucks the letter G And says a wizard told him that by G His issue disinherited should be And for my name of George begins with G It follows in his thought that I am he These as I learn and such like toys as these Hath moved his Highness to commit me now RICHARD Why this it is when men are ruled by women Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower My Lady Grey his wife Clarence tis she That tempers him to this extremity Was it not she and that good man of worship Antony Woodville her brother there That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower From whence this present day he is delivered We are not safe Clarence we are not safe CLARENCE By heaven I think there is no man secure But the Queens kindred and nightwalking heralds That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore Heard you not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery RICHARD Humbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty Ill tell you what I think it is our way If we will keep in favour with the King To be her men and wear her livery The jealous oerworn widow and herself Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen Are mighty gossips in our monarchy BRAKENBURY I beseech your Graces both to pardon me His Majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference Of what degree soever with your brother RICHARD Even so an please your worship Brakenbury You may partake of anything we say We speak no treason man We say the King Is wise and virtuous and his noble Queen Well struck in years fair and not jealous We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue And that the Queens kindred are made gentlefolks How say you sir Can you deny all this BRAKENBURY With this my lord myself have naught to do RICHARD Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee fellow He that doth naught with her excepting one Were best to do it secretly alone BRAKENBURY What one my lord RICHARD Her husband knave Wouldst thou betray me BRAKENBURY I do beseech your Grace to pardon me and withal Forbear your conference with the noble Duke CLARENCE We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey RICHARD We are the Queens abjects and must obey Brother farewell I will unto the KingAnd whatsoeer you will employ me in Were it to call King Edwards widow sister I will perform it to enfranchise you Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagine CLARENCE I know it pleaseth neither of us well RICHARD Well your imprisonment shall not be long I will deliver or else lie for you Meantime have patience CLARENCE I must perforce Farewell Exeunt Clarence Brakenbury and guard RICHARD Go tread the path that thou shalt neer return Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven If heaven will take the present at our hands But who comes here The newdelivered Hastings Enter Lord Hastings HASTINGS Good time of day unto my gracious lord RICHARD As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain Well are you welcome to the open air How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment HASTINGS With patience noble lord as prisoners must But I shall live my lord to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonment RICHARD No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too For they that were your enemies are his And have prevailed as much on him as you HASTINGS More pity that the eagles should be mewed Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty RICHARD What news abroad HASTINGS No news so bad abroad as this at home The King is sickly weak and melancholy And his physicians fear him mightily RICHARD Now by Saint John that news is bad indeed O he hath kept an evil diet long And overmuch consumed his royal person Tis very grievous to be thought upon Where is he in his bed HASTINGS He is RICHARD Go you before and I will follow you Exit Hastings He cannot live I hope and must not die Till George be packed with posthorse up to heaven Ill in to urge his hatred more to Clarence With lies well steeled with weighty arguments And if I fail not in my deep intent Clarence hath not another day to live Which done God take King Edward to his mercy And leave the world for me to bustle in For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter What though I killed her husband and her father The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father The which will I not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto But yet I run before my horse to market Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns When they are gone then must I count my gains Exit SCENE II London Another street Enter the corse of King Henry the Sixth with Halberds to guard it Lady Anne being the mourner Tressel and Berkeley and other Gentlemen ANNE Set down set down your honourable load If honour may be shrouded in a hearse Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament Th untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster Poor keycold figure of a holy king Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost To hear the lamentations of poor Anne Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughtered son Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds Lo in these windows that let forth thy life I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes O cursed be the hand that made these holes Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence More direful hap betide that hated wretch That makes us wretched by the death of thee Than I can wish to adders spiders toads Or any creeping venomed thing that lives If ever he have child abortive be it Prodigious and untimely brought to light Whose ugly and unnatural aspect May fright the hopeful mother at the view And that be heir to his unhappiness If ever he have wife let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my young lord and thee Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load Taken from Pauls to be interred there And still as you are weary of this weight Rest you whiles I lament King Henrys corse They take up the bier Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester RICHARD Stay you that bear the corse and set it down ANNE What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds RICHARD Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul Ill make a corse of him that disobeys GENTLEMAN My lord stand back and let the coffin pass RICHARD Unmannered dog stand thou when I command Advance thy halberd higher than my breast Or by Saint Paul Ill strike thee to my foot And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness They set down the bier ANNE What do you tremble Are you all afraid Alas I blame you not for you are mortal And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell Thou hadst but power over his mortal body His soul thou canst not have therefore begone RICHARD Sweet saint for charity be not so curst ANNE Foul devil for Gods sake hence and trouble us not For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds Behold this pattern of thy butcheries O gentlemen see see dead Henrys wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity For tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural Provokes this deluge most unnatural O God which this blood madst revenge his death O earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick As thou dost swallow up this good Kings blood Which his hellgoverned arm hath butchered RICHARD Lady you know no rules of charity Which renders good for bad blessings for curses ANNE Villain thou knowst nor law of God nor man No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity RICHARD But I know none and therefore am no beast ANNE O wonderful when devils tell the truth RICHARD More wonderful when angels are so angry Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman Of these supposed crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself ANNE Vouchsafe diffused infection of a man Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self RICHARD Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself ANNE Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself RICHARD By such despair I should accuse myself ANNE And by despairing shalt thou stand excused For doing worthy vengeance on thyself That didst unworthy slaughter upon others RICHARD Say that I slew them not ANNE Then say they were not slain But dead they are and devilish slave by thee RICHARD I did not kill your husband ANNE Why then he is alive RICHARD Nay he is dead and slain by Edwards hand ANNE In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw Thy murdrous falchion smoking in his blood The which thou once didst bend against her breast But that thy brothers beat aside the point RICHARD I was provoked by her slandrous tongue That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders ANNE Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind That never dreamst on aught but butcheries Didst thou not kill this King RICHARD I grant ye ANNE Dost grant me hedgehog Then God grant me too Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed O he was gentle mild and virtuous RICHARD The better for the King of Heaven that hath him ANNE He is in heaven where thou shalt never come RICHARD Let him thank me that holp to send him thither For he was fitter for that place than earth ANNE And thou unfit for any place but hell RICHARD Yes one place else if you will hear me name it ANNE Some dungeon RICHARD Your bedchamber ANNE Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest RICHARD So will it madam till I lie with you ANNE I hope so RICHARD I know so But gentle Lady Anne To leave this keen encounter of our wits And fall something into a slower method Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward As blameful as the executioner ANNE Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect RICHARD Your beauty was the cause of that effect Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom ANNE If I thought that I tell thee homicide These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks RICHARD These eyes could not endure that beautys wrack You should not blemish it if I stood by As all the world is cheered by the sun So I by that it is my day my life ANNE Black night oershade thy day and death thy life RICHARD Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both ANNE I would I were to be revenged on thee RICHARD It is a quarrel most unnatural To be revenged on him that loveth thee ANNE It is a quarrel just and reasonable To be revenged on him that killed my husband RICHARD He that bereft thee lady of thy husband Did it to help thee to a better husband ANNE His better doth not breathe upon the earth RICHARD He lives that loves thee better than he could ANNE Name him RICHARD Plantagenet ANNE Why that was he RICHARD The selfsame name but one of better nature ANNE Where is he RICHARD Here She spits at him Why dost thou spit at me ANNE Would it were mortal poison for thy sake RICHARD Never came poison from so sweet a place ANNE Never hung poison on a fouler toad Out of my sight Thou dost infect mine eyes RICHARD Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine ANNE Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead RICHARD I would they were that I might die at once For now they kill me with a living death Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears Shamed their aspects with store of childish drops These eyes which never shed remorseful tear No when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When blackfaced Clifford shook his sword at him Nor when thy warlike father like a child Told the sad story of my fathers death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep That all the standersby had wet their cheeks Like trees bedashed with rain In that sad time My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping I never sued to friend nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word But now thy beauty is proposed my fee My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak She looks scornfully at him Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made For kissing lady not for such contempt If thy revengeful heart cannot forgiveLo here I lend thee this sharppointed sword Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee He kneels and lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry But twas thy beauty that provoked me Nay now dispatch twas I that stabbed young Edward But twas thy heavenly face that set me on She falls the sword Take up the sword again or take up me ANNE Arise dissembler Though I wish thy death I will not be thy executioner RICHARD Then bid me kill myself and I will do it ANNE I have already RICHARD That was in thy rage Speak it again and even with the word This hand which for thy love did kill thy love Shall for thy love kill a far truer love To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary ANNE I would I knew thy heart RICHARD Tis figured in my tongue ANNE I fear me both are false RICHARD Then never was man true ANNE Well well put up your sword RICHARD Say then my peace is made ANNE That shalt thou know hereafter RICHARD But shall I live in hope ANNE All men I hope live so RICHARD Vouchsafe to wear this ring ANNE To take is not to give He places the ring on her hand RICHARD Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart Wear both of them for both of them are thine And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favour at thy gracious hand Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever ANNE What is it RICHARD That it may please you leave these sad designs To him that hath most cause to be a mourner And presently repair to Crosby Place Where after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monastery this noble King And wet his grave with my repentant tears I will with all expedient duty see you For divers unknown reasons I beseech you Grant me this boon ANNE With all my heart and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent Tressel and Berkeley go along with me RICHARD Bid me farewell ANNE Tis more than you deserve But since you teach me how to flatter you Imagine I have said farewell already Exeunt Lady Anne Tressel and Berkeley RICHARD Sirs take up the corse GENTLEMAN Towards Chertsey noble lord RICHARD No to White Friars there attend my coming Exeunt Halberds and Gentlemen with corse Was ever woman in this humour wooed Was ever woman in this humour won Ill have her but I will not keep her long What I that killed her husband and his father To take her in her hearts extremest hate With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes The bleeding witness of her hatred by Having God her conscience and these bars against me And I no friends to back my suit at all But the plain devil and dissembling looks And yet to win her all the world to nothing Ha Hath she forgot already that brave prince Edward her lord whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewksbury A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman Framed in the prodigality of nature Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal The spacious world cannot again afford And will she yet abase her eyes on me That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed On me whose all not equals Edwards moiety On me that halt and am

thereunto But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do DESDEMONA O heavy ignorance Thou praisest the worst best But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself IAGO She that was ever fair and never proud Had tongue at will and yet was never loud Never lackd gold and yet went never gay Fled from her wish and yet said Now I may She that being angerd her revenge being nigh Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cods head for the salmons tail She that could think and neer disclose her mind See suitors following and not look behind She was a wight if ever such wight were DESDEMONA To do what IAGO To suckle fools and chronicle

madam You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar IAGO Aside He takes her by the palm Ay well said whisper With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good well kissed an excellent courtesy Tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clysterpipes for your sake Trumpets within The Moor I know his trumpet CASSIO Tis truly so DESDEMONA Lets meet him and receive him CASSIO Lo where he comes Enter Othello and Attendants OTHELLO O my fair warrior DESDEMONA My dear Othello OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me O my souls joy If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have wakend death And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympushigh and duck again as low As hells from heaven If it were now to die Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate DESDEMONA The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow OTHELLO Amen to that sweet powers I cannot speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords be They kiss That eer our hearts shall make IAGO Aside O you are well tund now But Ill set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I am OTHELLO Come let us to the castle News friends our wars are done the Turks are drownd How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey you shall be well desird in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comfortsI prithee good Iago Go to the bay and disembark my coffers Bring thou the

at the harbour Come hither If thou best valiantas they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him RODERIGO With him Why tis not possible IAGO Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed And what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none A slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after A pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already RODERIGO I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition IAGO Blest figs end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that RODERIGO Yes that I did But that was but courtesy IAGO Lechery by this hand An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embracd together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight For the command Ill layt upon you Cassio knows you not Ill not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister RODERIGO Well IAGO Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell RODERIGO Adieu Exit IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evend with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash For his quick hunting stand the putting on Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And

I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello CASSIO Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainmentIAGO O they are our friends but one cup Ill drink for you CASSIO I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more IAGO What man Tis a night of revels The gallants desire it

and do but see his vice Tis to his virtue a just equinox The one as long as th other Tis pity of him I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island MONTANO But is he often thus IAGO Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep Hell watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle MONTANO It were well The general were put in mind of it Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils is not this true Enter Roderigo IAGO Aside to him How now Roderigo I pray you after the lieutenant go Exit Roderigo MONTANO And tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity It were an honest action to say so To the Moor

IAGO Hold ho lieutenantsirMontanogentlemen Have you forgot all place of sense and duty Hold The general speaks to you hold hold for shame OTHELLO Why how now ho From whence ariseth this Are we turnd Turks and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety What is the matter masters Honest Iago that looks dead with grieving Speak who began this On thy love I charge thee IAGO I do not know Friends all but now even now In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed and then but now As if some planet had unwitted men Swords out and tilting one at others breast In opposition bloody I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it OTHELLO How comes it Michael you are thus forgot CASSIO I pray you pardon me I cannot speak OTHELLO Worthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure whats the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler Give me answer to it MONTANO Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger Your officer Iago can inform you While I spare speech which something now offends me Of all that I do know nor know I aught By me thats said or done amiss this night Unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us OTHELLO Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way Zounds if I stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approvd in this offence Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety Tis monstrous Iago who begant MONTANO If partially affind or leagud in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier IAGO Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determind sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamour as it so fell out The town might fall in fright he swift of foot Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I neer might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass OTHELLO I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine Enter Desdemona attended Look if my gentle love be not raisd up Ill make thee an example DESDEMONA Whats the matter OTHELLO Alls well now sweeting come away to bed Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon Lead him off Montano is led off Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted Come Desdemona tis the soldiers life To have their balmy slumbers wakd with strife Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio IAGO What are you hurt lieutenant CASSIO Ay past all surgery IAGO Marry Heaven forbid CASSIO Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation IAGO As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you CASSIO I know not IAGO Ist possible CASSIO I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains That we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beastsIAGO Why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself IAGO Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good CASSIO I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblessd and the ingredient is a devil IAGO Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love you CASSIO I have well approved it sirI drunk IAGO You or any man living may be drunk at a time man Ill tell you what you shall do Our generals wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her Importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before CASSIO You advise me well IAGO I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness CASSIO I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here IAGO You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch CASSIO Good night honest Iago Exit IAGO And whats he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit Shes framd as fruitful As the free elements And then for her To win the Moor weret to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetterd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now for whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor Ill pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her bodys lust And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all Enter Roderigo How now Roderigo RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice IAGO How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time Doest not go well Cassio hath beaten thee And thou by that small hurt hast cashierd Cassio Though other things grow fair against the sun Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe Content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee gone Exit Roderigo Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress Ill set her on Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife Ay thats the way Dull not device by coldness and delay Exit ACT III SCENE I Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Cassio and some Musicians CASSIO Masters play here I will content your pains Something thats brief and bid Good morrow general Music Enter

entreats her a little favour of speech Wilt thou do this CLOWN She is stirring sir if she will stir hither I shall seem to notify unto her CASSIO Do good my friend Exit Clown Enter Iago In happy time Iago IAGO You have not been abed then CASSIO Why no The day had broke Before we parted I have made bold Iago To send in to your wife My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access IAGO Ill send her to you presently And Ill devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way that your converse and business May be more free CASSIO I humbly thank you fort Exit Iago I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest Enter Emilia EMILIA Good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again CASSIO Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone EMILIA Pray you come in I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely CASSIO I am much bound to you Exeunt SCENE II Cyprus A Room in the Castle

love my lord You have known him long and be you well assurd He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distance CASSIO Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstance That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service DESDEMONA Do not doubt that Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee If I do vow a friendship Ill perform it To the last article My lord shall never rest Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift Ill intermingle everything he does With Cassios suit Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away Enter Othello and Iago EMILIA Madam here comes my lord CASSIO Madam Ill take my leave DESDEMONA Why stay and hear me speak CASSIO Madam not now I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes DESDEMONA Well do your discretion Exit Cassio IAGO Ha I like not that OTHELLO What dost thou say IAGO Nothing my lord or ifI know not what OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife IAGO Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike Seeing you coming OTHELLO I do believe twas he DESDEMONA How now my lord I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure OTHELLO Who ist you mean DESDEMONA Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back OTHELLO Went he hence now DESDEMONA Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him back OTHELLO Not now sweet Desdemon some other time DESDEMONA But shallt be shortly OTHELLO The sooner sweet for you DESDEMONA Shallt be tonight at supper OTHELLO No not tonight

prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith hes penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason Save that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath taen your part to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do much OTHELLO Prithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothingDESDEMONA Why this is not a boon Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this To leave me but a little to myself DESDEMONA Shall I deny you No farewell my lord OTHELLO Farewell my Desdemona Ill come to thee straight DESDEMONA Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you Whateer you be I am obedient Exit with Emilia OTHELLO Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee And when I love thee not Chaos is come again IAGO My noble lord OTHELLO What dost thou say Iago IAGO Did Michael Cassio when you wood my lady Know of your love OTHELLO He did from first to last Why dost thou ask IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought No further harm OTHELLO Why of thy thought Iago IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her OTHELLO O yes and went between us very oft IAGO Indeed OTHELLO Indeed Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that Is he not honest IAGO Honest my lord OTHELLO Honest ay honest IAGO My lord for aught I know OTHELLO What dost thou think IAGO Think my lord OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou likst not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me Show me thy thought IAGO My lord you know I love you OTHELLO I think thou dost And for I know thourt full of love and honesty And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just Theyre close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule IAGO For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest OTHELLO I think so too IAGO Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem IAGO Why then I think Cassios an honest man OTHELLO Nay yet theres more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words IAGO Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As wheres that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear A stranger to thy thoughts IAGO I do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my natures plague To spy into abuses and of my jealousy Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts OTHELLO What dost thou mean IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed OTHELLO By heaven Ill know thy thoughts IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody OTHELLO Ha IAGO O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he oer Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves OTHELLO O misery IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy OTHELLO Why why is this Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolvd exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abusd Look tot I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience Is not to leave undone but keep unknown OTHELLO Dost thou say so IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most OTHELLO And so she did IAGO Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever IAGO I see this hath a little dashd your spirits OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot IAGO Trust me I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see youre movd I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion OTHELLO I will not IAGO Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend My lord"

partly in the Usurpers court and partly in the Forest of Arden ACT I SCENE I An Orchard near Olivers house Enter Orlando and Adam ORLANDO As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayst charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit For my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid itEnter Oliver ADAM Yonder comes my master your brother ORLANDO Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up Adam retires OLIVER Now sir what make you here ORLANDO Nothing I am not taught to make anything OLIVER What mar you then sir ORLANDO Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness OLIVER Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile ORLANDO Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury OLIVER Know you where you are sir ORLANDO O sir very well here in your orchard OLIVER Know you before whom sir ORLANDO Ay better than him I am before knows me I know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the firstborn but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence OLIVER What boy ORLANDO Come come elder brother you are too young in this OLIVER Wilt thou lay hands on me villain ORLANDO I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so Thou has railed on thyself ADAM Coming forward Sweet masters be patient For your fathers remembrance be at accord OLIVER Let me go I say ORLANDO I will not till I please You shall hear me My father charged you in his will to give me good education You have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy my fortunes OLIVER And what wilt thou do Beg when that is spent Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled with you You shall have some part of your will I pray you leave me ORLANDO I no further offend you than becomes me for my good OLIVER Get you with him you old dog ADAM Is old dog my reward Most true I have lost my teeth in your service God be with my old master He would not have spoke such a word Exeunt Orlando and Adam OLIVER Is it even so Begin you to grow upon me I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla Dennis Enter Dennis DENNIS Calls your worship OLIVER Was not Charles the Dukes wrestler here to speak with me DENNIS So please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you OLIVER Call him in Exit Dennis Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is Enter Charles CHARLES Good morrow to your worship OLIVER Good Monsieur Charles Whats the new news at the new court CHARLES Theres no news at the court sir but the old news That is the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander OLIVER Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter be banished with her father CHARLES O no for the Dukes daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do OLIVER Where will the old Duke live CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world OLIVER What you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in Therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will OLIVER Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other For I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come tomorrow Ill give him his payment If ever he go alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more And so God keep your worship Exit OLIVER Farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an end of him for my soulyet I know not whyhates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that I am altogether misprized But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about Exit SCENE II A Lawn before the Dukes Palace Enter Rosalind and Celia CELIA I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry ROSALIND Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure CELIA Herein I see thou lovst me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine So wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee ROSALIND Well I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours CELIA You know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection By mine honour I will And when I break that oath let me turn monster Therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry ROSALIND From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let me seewhat think you of falling in love CELIA Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again ROSALIND What shall be our sport then CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally ROSALIND I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women CELIA Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very illfavouredly ROSALIND Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of Nature Enter Touchstone CELIA No When Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ROSALIND Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of Natures wit CELIA Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the witsHow now wit whither wander you TOUCHSTONE Mistress you must come away to your father CELIA Were you made the messenger TOUCHSTONE No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you ROSALIND Where learned you that oath fool TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught Now Ill stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn CELIA How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ROSALIND Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom TOUCHSTONE Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave CELIA By our beards if we had them thou art TOUCHSTONE By my knavery if I had it then I were But if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn No more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard CELIA Prithee who ist that thou meanst TOUCHSTONE One that old Frederick your father loves CELIA My fathers love is enough to honour him Enough Speak no more of him Youll be whipped for taxation one of these days TOUCHSTONE The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly CELIA By my troth thou sayest true For since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le BeauEnter Le Beau ROSALIND With his mouth full of news CELIA Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young ROSALIND Then shall we be newscrammed CELIA All the better we shall be the more marketable Bonjour Monsieur Le Beau Whats the news LE BEAU Fair princess you have lost much good sport CELIA Sport Of what colour LE BEAU What colour madam How shall I answer you ROSALIND As wit and fortune will TOUCHSTONE Or as the destinies decrees CELIA Well said That was laid on with a trowel TOUCHSTONE Nay if I keep not my rank ROSALIND Thou losest thy old smell LE BEAU You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of ROSALIND Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling LE BEAU I will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it CELIA Well the beginning that is dead and buried LE BEAU There comes an old man and his three sons CELIA I could match this beginning with an old tale LE BEAU Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence ROSALIND With bills on their necks Be it known unto all men by these presents LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the Dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him So he served the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping ROSALIND Alas TOUCHSTONE But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost LE BEAU Why this that I speak of TOUCHSTONE Thus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies CELIA Or I I promise thee ROSALIND But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon ribbreaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin LE BEAU You must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it CELIA Yonder sure they are coming Let us now stay and see it Flourish Enter Duke Frederick Lords Orlando Charles and Attendants DUKE FREDERICK Come on Since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness ROSALIND Is yonder the man LE BEAU Even he madam CELIA Alas he is too young Yet he looks successfully DUKE FREDERICK How now daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ROSALIND Ay my liege so please you give us leave DUKE FREDERICK You will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man In pity of the challengers youth I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if you can move him CELIA Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau DUKE FREDERICK Do so Ill not be by Duke Frederick steps aside LE BEAU Monsieur the challenger the Princess calls for you ORLANDO I attend them with all respect and duty ROSALIND Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler ORLANDO No fair princess He is the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth CELIA Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years You have seen cruel proof of this mans strength If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt ROSALIND Do young sir Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward ORLANDO I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty ROSALIND The little strength that I have I would it were with you CELIA And mine to eke out hers ROSALIND Fare you well Pray heaven I be deceived in you CELIA Your hearts desires be with you CHARLES Come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ORLANDO Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working DUKE FREDERICK You shall try but one fall CHARLES No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first ORLANDO You mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before But come your ways ROSALIND Now Hercules be thy speed young man CELIA I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg Orlando and Charles wrestle ROSALIND O excellent young man CELIA If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down Charles is thrown Shout DUKE FREDERICK No more no more ORLANDO Yes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathed DUKE FREDERICK How dost thou Charles LE BEAU He cannot speak my lord DUKE FREDERICK Bear him away Charles is carried off by Attendants What is thy name young man ORLANDO Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys DUKE FREDERICK I would thou hadst been son to some man else The world esteemed thy father honourable But I did find him still mine enemy Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth I would thou hadst told me of another father Exeunt Duke Frederick Le Beau and Lords CELIA Were I my father coz would I do this ORLANDO I am more proud to be Sir Rowlands son His youngest son and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick ROSALIND My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul And all the world was of my fathers mind Had I before known this young man his son I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured CELIA Gentle cousin Let us go thank him and encourage him My fathers rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heartSir you have well deserved If you do keep your promises in love But justly as you have exceeded promise Your mistress shall be happy ROSALIND Gentleman Giving him a chain from her neck Wear this for meone out of suits with Fortune That could give more but that her hand lacks means Shall we go coz CELIA AyFare you well fair gentleman ORLANDO Can I not say I thank you My better parts Are all thrown down and that which here stands up Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block ROSALIND He calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes Ill ask him what he wouldDid you call sir Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemies CELIA Will you go coz ROSALIND Have with youFare you well Exeunt Rosalind and Celia ORLANDO What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue I cannot speak to her yet she urged conference O poor Orlando thou art overthrown Or Charles or something weaker masters thee Enter Le Beau LE BEAU Good sir I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place Albeit you have deserved High commendation true applause and love Yet such is now the Dukes condition That he misconsters all that you have done The Duke is humorous what he is indeed More suits you to conceive than I to speak of ORLANDO I thank you sir and pray you tell me this Which of the two was daughter of the Duke That here was at the wrestling LE BEAU Neither his daughter if we judge by manners But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter The other is daughter to the banished Duke And here detained by her usurping uncle To keep his daughter company whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters But I can tell you that of late this Duke Hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good fathers sake And on my life his malice gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well Hereafter in a better world than this I shall desire more love and knowledge of you ORLANDO I rest much bounden to you fare you well Exit Le Beau Thus must I from the smoke into the smother From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother But heavenly Rosalind Exit SCENE III A Room in the Palace Enter Celia and Rosalind CELIA Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy Not a word ROSALIND Not one to throw at a dog CELIA No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs Throw some of them at me Come lame me with reasons ROSALIND Then there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any CELIA But is all this for your father ROSALIND No some of it is for my childs father O how full of briers is this workingday world CELIA They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them ROSALIND I could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart CELIA Hem them away ROSALIND I would try if I could cry hem and have him CELIA Come come wrestle with thy affections ROSALIND O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself CELIA O a good wish upon you You will try in time in despite of a fall But turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowlands youngest son ROSALIND The Duke my father loved his father dearly CELIA Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate not Orlando ROSALIND No faith hate him not for my sake CELIA Why should I not Doth he not deserve well Enter Duke Frederick with Lords ROSALIND Let me love him for that and do you love him because I doLook here comes the Duke CELIA With his eyes full of anger DUKE FREDERICK Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste And get you from our court ROSALIND Me uncle DUKE FREDERICK You cousin Within these ten days if that thou best found So near our public court as twenty miles Thou diest for it ROSALIND I do beseech your Grace Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me If with myself I hold intelligenceOr have acquaintance with mine own desires If that I do not dream or be not frantic As I do trust I am notthen dear uncle Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness DUKE FREDERICK Thus do all traitors If their purgation did consist in words They are as innocent as grace itself Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not ROSALIND Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor Tell me whereon the likelihood depends DUKE FREDERICK Thou art thy fathers daughter theres enough ROSALIND So was I when your highness took his dukedom So was I when your highness banished him Treason is not inherited my lord Or if we did derive it from our friends Whats that to me My father was no traitor Then good my liege mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous CELIA Dear sovereign hear me speak DUKE FREDERICK Ay Celia we stayed her for your sake Else had she with her father ranged along CELIA I did not then entreat to have her stay It was your pleasure and your own remorse I was too young that time to value her But now I know her If she be a traitor Why so am I We still have slept together Rose at an instant learned played ate together And wheresoeer we went like Junos swans Still we went coupled and inseparable DUKE FREDERICK She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people and they pity her Thou art a fool She robs thee of thy name And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone Then open not thy lips Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her She is banished CELIA Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege I cannot live out of her company DUKE FREDERICK You are a fool You niece provide yourself If you outstay the time upon mine honour And in the greatness of my word you die Exeunt Duke Frederick and Lords CELIA O my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou go Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am ROSALIND I have more cause CELIA Thou hast not cousin Prithee be cheerful Knowst thou not the Duke Hath banished me his daughter ROSALIND That he hath not CELIA No hath not Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one Shall we be sundered Shall we part sweet girl No let my father seek another heir Therefore devise with me how we may fly Whither to go and what to bear with us And do not seek to take your change upon you To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale Say what thou canst Ill go along with thee ROSALIND Why whither shall we go CELIA To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden ROSALIND Alas what danger will it be to us Maids as we are to travel forth so far Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold CELIA Ill put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face The like do you so shall we pass along And never stir assailants ROSALIND Were it not better Because that I am more than common tall That I did suit me all points like a man A gallant curtalaxe upon my thigh A boarspear in my hand and in my heart Lie there what hidden womans fear there will Well have a swashing and a martial outside As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances CELIA What shall I call thee when thou art a man ROSALIND Ill have no worse a name than Joves own page And therefore look you call me Ganymede But what will you be called CELIA Something that hath a reference to my state No longer Celia but Aliena ROSALIND But cousin what if we assayed to steal The clownish fool out of your fathers court Would he not be a comfort to our travel CELIA Hell go along oer the wide world with me Leave me alone to woo him Lets away And get our jewels and our wealth together Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight Now go we in content To liberty and not to banishment Exeunt ACT II SCENE I The Forest of Arden Enter Duke Senior Amiens and two or three Lords dressed as foresters DUKE SENIOR Now my comates and brothers in exile Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court Here feel we not the penalty of Adam The seasons difference as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winters wind Which when it bites and blows upon my body Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say This is no flattery These are counsellors That feelingly persuade me what I am Sweet are the uses of adversity Which like the toad ugly and venomous Wears yet a precious jewel in his head And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks Sermons in stones and good in everything AMIENS I would not change it Happy is your grace That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style DUKE SENIOR Come shall we go and kill us venison And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools Being native burghers of this desert city Should in their own confines with forked heads Have their round haunches gored FIRST LORD Indeed my lord The melancholy Jaques grieves at that And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banished you Today my lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood To the which place a poor sequestered stag That from the hunters aim had taen a hurt Did come to languish and indeed my lord The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase And thus the hairy fool Much marked of the melancholy Jaques Stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook Augmenting it with tears DUKE SENIOR But what said Jaques Did he not moralize this spectacle FIRST LORD O yes into a thousand similes First for his weeping into the needless stream Poor deer quoth he thou makst a testament As worldlings do giving thy sum of more To that which had too much Then being there alone Left and abandoned of his velvet friends Tis right quoth he thus misery doth part The flux of company Anon a careless herd Full of the pasture jumps along by him And never stays to greet him Ay quoth

corners thrown Take that and He that doth the ravens feed Yea providently caters for the sparrow Be comfort to my age Here is the gold All this I give you Let me be your servant Though I look old yet

THERSITES Now she sharpens Well said whetstone DIOMEDES I shall have it CRESSIDA What this DIOMEDES Ay that CRESSIDA O all you gods O pretty pretty pledge Thy master now lies thinking on his bed Of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove And gives memorial dainty kisses to it As I kiss thee Nay do not snatch it from me He that takes that doth take my heart withal DIOMEDES I had your heart before this follows it TROILUS I did swear patience CRESSIDA You shall not have it Diomed faith you shall not Ill give you something else DIOMEDES I will have this Whose was it CRESSIDA It is no matter DIOMEDES Come tell me whose it was CRESSIDA Twas ones that lovd me better than you will But now you have it take it DIOMEDES Whose was it CRESSIDA By all Dianas waiting women yond And by herself I will not tell you whose DIOMEDES Tomorrow will I wear it on my helm And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it TROILUS Wert thou the devil and worst it on thy horn It should be challengd CRESSIDA Well well tis done tis past and yet it is not I will not keep my word DIOMEDES Why then farewell Thou never shalt mock Diomed again CRESSIDA You shall not go One cannot speak a word

I shall be plagud DIOMEDES Farewell till then CRESSIDA Good night I prithee come Exit Diomedes Troilus farewell One eye yet looks on thee But with my heart the other eye doth see Ah poor our sex this fault in us I find The error of our eye directs our mind What error leads must err O then conclude Minds swayd by eyes are full of turpitude Exit THERSITES A proof of strength she could not publish more Unless she said My mind is now turnd whore ULYSSES Alls done my lord TROILUS It is ULYSSES Why stay we then TROILUS To make a recordation to my soul Of every syllable that here was spoke But if I tell how these two did coact Shall I not lie in publishing a truth Sith yet there is a credence in my heart An esperance so obstinately strong That doth invert thattest of eyes and ears As if those organs had deceptious functions Created only to calumniate Was Cressid here ULYSSES I cannot conjure Trojan TROILUS She was not sure ULYSSES Most sure she was TROILUS Why my negation hath no taste of madness ULYSSES Nor mine my lord Cressid was here but now TROILUS Let it not be believd for womanhood Think we had mothers do not give advantage To stubborn critics apt without a theme For depravation to square the general sex By Cressids rule Rather think this not Cressid ULYSSES What hath she done Prince that can soil our mothers TROILUS Nothing at all unless that this were she THERSITES Will he swagger himself out ons own eyes TROILUS This she No this is Diomeds Cressida If beauty have a soul this is not she If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies If sanctimony be the gods delight If there be rule in unity itself This was not she O madness of discourse That cause sets up with and against itself Bifold authority where reason can revolt Without perdition and loss assume all reason Without revolt this is and is not Cressid Within my soul there doth conduce a fight Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate Divides more wider than the sky and earth And yet the spacious breadth of this divisionAdmits no orifice for a point as subtle As Ariachnes broken woof to enter Instance O instance strong as Plutos gates Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven Instance O instance strong as heaven itself The bonds of heaven are slippd dissolvd and loosd And with another knot fivefingertied The fractions of her faith orts of her love The fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics Of her oereaten faith are given to Diomed ULYSSES May worthy Troilus be half attachd With that which here his passion doth express TROILUS Ay Greek and that shall be divulged well In characters as red as Mars his heart Inflamd with Venus Never did young man fancy With so eternal and so fixd a soul Hark Greek as much as I do Cressid love So much by weight hate I her Diomed That sleeve is mine that hell bear on his helm Were it a casque composd by Vulcans skill My sword should bite it Not the dreadful spout Which shipmen do the hurricano call Constringd in mass by the almighty sun Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptunes ear In his descent than shall my prompted sword Falling on Diomed THERSITES Hell tickle it for his concupy TROILUS O Cressid O false Cressid false false false Let all untruths stand by thy stained name And theyll seem glorious ULYSSES O contain yourself Your passion draws ears hither Enter Aeneas AENEAS I have been seeking you this hour my lord Hector by this is arming him in Troy Ajax your guard stays to conduct you home TROILUS Have with you Prince My courteous lord adieu Fairwell revolted fair and Diomed Stand fast and wear a castle on thy head ULYSSES Ill bring you to the gates TROILUS Accept distracted thanks Exeunt Troilus Aeneas and Ulysses THERSITES Would I could meet that rogue Diomed I would croak like a raven I would bode I would bode Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab Lechery lechery Still wars and lechery Nothing else holds fashion A burning devil take them Exit SCENE III Troy Before Priams palace Enter Hector and Andromache ANDROMACHE When was my lord so much ungently temperd To stop his ears against

of chivalry Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong And tempt not yet the brushes of the war Unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy Ill stand today for thee and me and Troy TROILUS Brother you have a vice of mercy in you Which better fits a lion than a man HECTOR What vice is that Good Troilus chide me for it TROILUS When many times the captive Grecian falls Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword You bid them rise and live HECTOR O tis fair play TROILUS Fools play by heaven Hector HECTOR How now how now TROILUS For th love of all the gods Lets leave the hermit Pity with our mother And when we have our armours buckled on The venomd vengeance ride upon our swords Spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth HECTOR Fie savage fie TROILUS Hector then tis wars HECTOR Troilus I would not have you fight today TROILUS Who should withhold me Not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees Their eyes oergalled

thy wounds do bleed at many vents Hark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries out How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth Behold distraction frenzy and amazement Like witless antics one another meet And all cry Hector Hectors dead O Hector TROILUS Away away CASSANDRA Farewell yet soft Hector I take my leave Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive Exit HECTOR You are amazd my liege at her

TROILUS They are at it hark Proud Diomed believe I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve Enter Pandarus PANDARUS Do you hear my lord Do you hear TROILUS What now PANDARUS Heres a letter come from yond poor girl TROILUS Let me read PANDARUS A whoreson tisick a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles me and the foolish fortune of this girl and what one thing what another that I shall leave you one o

true have often lived alone Which three till now never kept seat in one 106 When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they looked but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we which now behold these present days Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 107 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come Can yet the lease of my true love control Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured And the sad augurs mock their own presage Incertainties now crown themselves assured And peace proclaims olives of endless age Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes And thou in this shalt find thy monument When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 108 Whats in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit Whats new to speak what now to register That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine I must each day say oer the very same Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name So that eternal love in loves fresh case Weighs not the dust and injury of age Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place But makes antiquity for aye his page Finding the first conceit of love there bred Where time and outward form would show it dead 109 O never say that I was false of heart Though absence seemed my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that travels I return again Just to the time not with the time exchanged So that my self bring water for my stain Never believe though in my nature reigned All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood That it could so preposterously be stained To leave for nothing all thy sum of good For nothing this wide universe I call Save thou my rose in it thou art my all 110 Alas tis true I have gone here and there And made my self a motley to the view Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear Made old offences of affections new Most true it is that I have looked on truth Askance and strangely but by all above These blenches gave my heart another youth And worse essays proved thee my best of love Now all is done have what shall have no end Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof to try an older friend A god in love to whom I am confined Then give me welcome next my heaven the best Even to thy pure and most most loving breast 111 O for my sake do you with Fortune chide The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds Thence comes it that my name receives a brand And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in like the dyers hand Pity me then and wish I were renewed Whilst like a willing patient I will drink Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection No bitterness that I will bitter think Nor double penance to correct correction Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me 112 Your love and pity doth th impression fill Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow For what care I who calls me well or ill So you oergreen my bad my good allow You are my all the world and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue None else to me nor I to none alive That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others voices that my adders sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are Mark how with my neglect I do dispense You are so strongly in my purpose bred That all the world besides methinks are dead 113 Since I left you mine eye is in my mind And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function and is partly blind Seems seeing but effectually is out For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch Of his quick objects hath the mind no part Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight The most sweet favour or deformedst creature The mountain or the sea the day or night The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature Incapable of more replete with you My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue 114 Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true And that your love taught it this alchemy To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble Creating every bad a perfect best As fast as objects to his beams assemble O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing And my great mind most kingly drinks it up Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing And to his palate doth prepare the cup If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin 115 Those lines that I before have writ do lie Even those that said I could not love you dearer Yet then my judgement knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer But reckoning time whose millioned accidents Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents Divert strong minds to the course of altring things Alas why fearing of times tyranny Might I not then say Now I love you best When I was certain oer incertainty Crowning the present doubting of the rest Love is a babe then might I not say so To give full growth to that which still doth grow 116 Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove O no it is an everfixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wandring bark Whose worths unknown although his height be taken Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickles compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ nor no man ever loved 117 Accuse me thus that I have scanted all Wherein I should your great deserts repay Forgot upon your dearest love to call Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day That I have frequent been with unknown minds And given to time your own dearpurchased right That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight Book both my wilfulness and errors down And on just proof surmise accumulate Bring me within the level of your frown But shoot not at me in your wakened hate Since my appeal says I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love 118 Like as to make our appetite more keen With eager compounds we our palate urge As to prevent our maladies unseen We sicken to shun sickness when we purge Even so being full of your neercloying sweetness To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness To be diseased ere that there was true needing Thus policy in love t anticipate The ills that were not grew to faults assured And brought to medicine a healthful state Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured But thence I learn and find the lesson true Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 119 What potions have I drunk of Siren tears Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears Still losing when I saw my self to win What wretched errors hath my heart committed Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever O benefit of ill now I find true That better is by evil still made better And ruined love when it is built anew Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater So I return rebuked to my content And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent 120 That you were once unkind befriends me now And for that sorrow which I then did feel Needs must I under my transgression bow Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel For if you were by my unkindness shaken As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime O that our night of woe might have remembered My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits And soon to you as you to me then tendered The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits But that your trespass now becomes a fee Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me 121 Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed When not to be receives reproach of being And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed Not by our feeling but by others seeing For why should others false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood Or on my frailties why are frailer spies Which in their wills count bad what I think good No I am that I am and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own I may be straight though they themselves be bevel By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown Unless this general evil they maintain All men are bad and in their badness reign 122 Thy gift thy tables are within my brain Full charactered with lasting memory Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to eternity Or at the least so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist Till each to razed oblivion yield his partOf thee thy record never can be missed That poor retention could not so much hold Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score Therefore to give them from me was I bold To trust those tables that receive thee more To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me 123 No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel nothing strange They are but dressings of a former sight Our dates are brief and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told Thy registers and thee I both defy Not wondring at the present nor the past For thy records and what we see doth lie Made more or less by thy continual haste This I do vow and this shall ever be I will be true despite thy scythe and thee 124 If my dear love were but the child of state It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered As subject to times love or to times hate Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered No it was builded far from accident It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls It fears not policy that heretic Which works on leases of shortnumbered hours But all alone stands hugely politic That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers To this I witness call the fools of time Which die for goodness who have lived for crime 125 Weret aught to me I bore the canopy With my extern the outward honouring Or laid great bases for eternity Which proves more short than waste or ruining Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet forgoing simple savour Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent No let me be obsequious in thy heart And take thou my oblation poor but free Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art But mutual render only me for thee Hence thou suborned informer a true soul When most impeached stands least in thy control 126 O thou my lovely boy who in thy power Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour Who hast by waning grown and therein showst Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure She may detain but not still keep her treasure Her audit though delayed answered must be And her quietus is to render thee 127 In the old age black was not counted fair Or if it were it bore not beautys name But now is black beautys successive heir And beauty slandered with a bastard shame For since each hand hath put on natures power Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower But is profaned if not lives in disgrace Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem At such who not born fair no beauty lack Slandering creation with a false esteem Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe That every tongue says beauty should look so 128 How oft when thou my music music playst Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst The wiry concord that mine ear confounds Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap To kiss the tender inward of thy hand Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait Making dead wood more blest than living lips Since saucy jacks so happy are in this Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss 129 Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action and till action lust Is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight Past reason hunted and no sooner had Past reason hated as a swallowed bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad Mad in pursuit and in possession so Had having and in quest to have extreme A bliss in proof and proved a very woe Before a joy proposed behind a dream All this the world well knows yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 130 My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun Coral is far more red than her lips red If snow be white why then her breasts are dun If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head I have seen roses damasked red and white But no such roses see I in her cheeks And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks I love to hear her speak yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound I grant I never saw a goddess go My mistress when she walks treads on the ground And yet by heaven I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare 131 Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel Yet in good faith some say that thee behold Thy face hath not the power to make love groan To say they err I dare not be so bold Although I swear it to my self alone And to be sure that is not false I swear A thousand groans but thinking on thy face One on anothers neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgements place In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds And thence this slander as I think proceeds 132 Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain Have put on black and loving mourners be Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east Nor that full star that ushers in the even Doth half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning eyes become thy face O let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace And suit thy pity like in every part Then will I swear beauty herself is black And all they foul that thy complexion lack 133 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me Ist not enough to torture me alone But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken And my next self thou harder hast engrossed Of him my self and thee I am forsaken A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee Perforce am thine and all that is in me 134 So now I have confessed that he is thine And I my self am mortgaged to thy will My self Ill forfeit so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still But thou wilt not nor he will not be free For thou art covetous and he is kind He learned but suretylike to write for me Under that bond that him as fist doth bind The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take Thou usurer that putst forth all to use And sue a friend came debtor for my sake So him I lose through my unkind abuse Him have I lost thou hast both him and me He pays the whole and yet am I not free 135 Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will And Will to boot and Will in overplus More than enough am I that vex thee still To thy sweet will making addition thus Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine Shall will in others seem right gracious And in my will no fair acceptance shine The sea all water yet receives rain still And in abundance addeth to his store So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill Think all but one and me in that one Will 136 If thy soul check thee that I come so near Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will And will thy soul knows is admitted there Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love Ay fill it full with wills and my will one In things of great receipt with case we prove Among a number one is reckoned none Then in the number let me pass untold Though in thy stores account I one must be For nothing hold me so it please thee hold That nothing me a something sweet to thee Make but my name thy love and love that still And then thou lovst me for my name is Will 137 Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes That they behold and see not what they see They know what beauty is see where it lies Yet what the best is take the worst to be If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks Be anchored in the bay where all men ride Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied Why should my heart think that a several plot Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face In things right true my heart and eyes have erred And to this false plague are they now transferred 138 When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although she knows my days are past the best Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed But wherefore says she not she is unjust And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is in seeming trust And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore I lie with her and she with me And in our faults by lies we flattered be 139 O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue Use power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies And therefore from my face she turns my foes That they elsewhere might dart their injuries Yet do not so but since I am near slain Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain140 Be wise as thou art cruel do not press My tonguetied patience with too much disdain Lest sorrow lend me words and words express The manner of my pitywanting pain If I might teach thee wit better it were Though not to love yet love to tell me so As testy sick men when their deaths be near No news but health from their physicians know For if I should despair I should grow mad And in my madness might speak ill of thee Now this illwresting world is grown so bad Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be That I may not be so nor thou belied Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide 141 In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes For they in thee a thousand errors note But tis my heart that loves what they despise Who in despite of view is pleased to dote Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted Nor tender feeling to base touches prone Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be Only my plague thus far I count my gain That she that makes me sin awards me pain 142 Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving O but with mine compare thou thine own state And thou shalt find it merits not reproving Or if it do not from those lips of thine That have profaned their scarlet ornaments And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine Robbed others beds revenues of their rents Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee Root pity in thy heart that when it grows Thy pity may deserve to pitied be If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide By selfexample mayst thou be denied 143 Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch One of her feathered creatures broke away Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face Not prizing her poor infants discontent So runst thou after that which flies from thee Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me And play the mothers part kiss me be kind So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will If thou turn back and my loud crying still 144 Two loves I have of comfort and despair Which like two spirits do suggest me still The better angel is a man right fair The worser spirit a woman coloured ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her foul pride And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell But being both from me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out 145 Those lips that Loves own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said I hate To me that languished for her sake But when she saw my woeful state Straight in her heart did mercy come Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was used in giving gentle doom And taught it thus anew to greet I hate she altered with an end That followed it as gentle day Doth follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away I hate from hate away she threw And saved my life saying not you 146 Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth My sinful earth these rebel powers array Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth Painting thy outward walls so costly gay Why so large cost having so short a lease Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend Shall worms inheritors of this excess Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss And let that pine to aggravate thy store Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross Within be fed without be rich no more So shall thou feed on death that feeds on men And death once dead theres no more dying then 147 My love is as a fever longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill Th uncertain sickly appetite to please My reason the physician to my love Angry that his prescriptions are not kept Hath left me and I desperate now approve Desire is death which physic did except Past cure I am now reason is past care And franticmad with evermore unrest My thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are At random from the truth vainly expressed For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright Who art as black as hell as dark as night 148 O me what eyes hath love put in my head Which have no correspondence with true sight Or if they have where is my judgement fled That censures falsely what they see aright If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote What means the world to say it is not so If it be not then love doth well denote Loves eye is not so true as all mens no How can it O how can loves eye be true That is so vexed with watching and with tears No marvel then though I mistake my view The sun it self sees not till heaven clears O cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find 149 Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not When I against my self with thee partake Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self alltyrant for thy sake Who hateth thee that I do call my friend On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan What merit do I in my self respect That is so proud thy service to despise When all my best doth worship thy defect Commanded by the motion of thine eyes But love hate on for now I know thy mind Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind 150 O from what power hast thou this powerful might With insufficiency my heart to sway To make me give the lie to my true sight And swear that brightness doth not grace the day Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds Who taught thee how to make me love thee more The more I hear and see just cause of hate O though I love what others do abhor With others thou shouldst not abhor my state If thy unworthiness raised love in me More worthy I to be beloved of thee 151 Love is too young to know what conscience is Yet who knows not conscience is born of love Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove For thou betraying me I do betray My nobler part to my gross bodys treason My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason But rising at thy name doth point out thee As his triumphant prize proud of this pride He is contented thy poor drudge to be To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side No want of conscience hold it that I call Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall 152 In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn In vowing new hate after new love bearing But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee When I break twenty I am perjured most For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee And all my honest faith in thee is lost For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness Or made them swear against the thing they see For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I To swear against the truth so foul a lie 153 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep A maid of Dians this advantage found And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valleyfountain of that ground Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love A dateless lively heat still to endure And grew a seething bath which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired The boy for trial needs would touch my breast I sick withal the help of bath desired And thither hied a sad distempered guest But found no cure the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes 154 The little Lovegod lying once asleep Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep Came tripping by but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire Which many legions of true hearts had warmed And so the general of hot desire Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed This brand she quenched in a cool well by Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual Growing a bath and healthful remedy For men diseased but I my mistress thrall Came there for cure and this by that I prove Loves fire heats water water cools not love THE END ALLS WELL THAT

grandsire loved thee well Many a time he danced thee on his knee Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow Many a story hath he told to thee And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind And talk of them when he was dead and gone MARCUS How many thousand times hath these poor lips When they were living warmed themselves on thine O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss Bid him farewell commit him to the grave Do them that kindness and take leave of them YOUNG LUCIUS O grandsire grandsire een with all my heart Would I were dead so you did live again O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth Reenter Attendants with Aaron AEMILIUS You sad Andronici have done with woes Give sentence on the execrable wretch That hath been breeder of these dire events

in the earth AARON Ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb I am no baby I that with base prayers I should repent the evils I have done Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did Would I perform if I might have my will If one good deed in all my life I did I do repent it from my very soul LUCIUS Some loving friends convey the emperor hence And give him burial in his fathers grave My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our households monument As for that ravenous tiger Tamora No funeral rite nor man in mournful weed No mournful bell shall ring her burial But throw her forth to

his valour is crushd into folly his folly sauced with discretion There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of everything but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight

Marry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus chin CRESSIDA Andt had been a green hair I should have laughd too PANDARUS They laughd not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer CRESSIDA What

Cardinal Exeunt all but Wolsey WOLSEY So farewell to the little good you bear me Farewell A long farewell to all my greatness This is the state of man today he puts forth The tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms And bears his blushing honours thick upon him The third day comes a frost a killing frost And when he thinks good easy man full surely His greatness is aripening nips his root And then he falls as I do I have ventured Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders This many summers in a sea of glory But far beyond my depth My highblown pride At length broke under me and now has left me Weary and old with service to the mercy Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye I feel my heart new opened O how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes favours There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin More pangs and fears than wars or women have And when he falls he falls like Lucifer Never to hope again Enter Cromwell standing amazed Why how now Cromwell CROMWELL I have no power to speak sir WOLSEY What amazed At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline Nay an you weep I am fallen indeed CROMWELL How does your Grace WOLSEY Why well Never so truly happy my good Cromwell I know myself now and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities A still and quiet conscience The King has cured me I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders These ruined pillars out of pity taken A load would sink a navy too much honour O tis a burden Cromwell tis a burden Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven CROMWELL I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it WOLSEY I hope I have I am able now methinks Out of a fortitude of soul I feel To endure more miseries and greater far Than my weakhearted enemies dare offer What news abroad CROMWELL The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the King WOLSEY God bless him CROMWELL The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord Chancellor in your place WOLSEY Thats somewhat sudden But hes a learned man May he continue Long in his Highness favour and do justice For truths sake and his conscience that his bones When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings May have a tomb of orphans tears wept on him What more CROMWELL That Cranmer is returned with welcome Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury WOLSEY Thats news indeed CROMWELL Last that the Lady Anne Whom the King hath in secrecy long married This day was viewed in open as his Queen Going to chapel and the voice is now Only about her coronation WOLSEY There was the weight that pulled me down O Cromwell The King has gone beyond me All my glories In that one woman I have lost for ever No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours Or gild again the noble troops that waited Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell I am a poor fallen man unworthy now To be thy lord and master Seek the King That sun I pray may never set I have told him What and how true thou art He will advance thee Some little memory of me will stir him I know his noble naturenot to let Thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell Neglect him not make use now and provide For thine own future safety CROMWELL O my lord Must I then leave you Must I needs forgo So good so noble and so true a master Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord The King shall have my service but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours WOLSEY Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries but thou hast forced me Out of thy honest truth to play the woman Lets dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell And when I am forgotten as I shall be And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in A sure and safe one though thy master missed it Mark but my fall and that that ruined me Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition By that sin fell the angels how can man then The image of his maker hope to win by it Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee Corruption wins not more than honesty Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not Let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys Thy Gods and truths Then if thou fallst O Cromwell Thou fallst a blessed martyr Serve the King And prithee lead me in There take an inventory of all I have To the last penny tis the Kings My robe And my integrity to heaven is all I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king He would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies CROMWELL Good sir have patience WOLSEY So I have Farewell The hopes of court My hopes in heaven do dwellExeunt ACT IV SCENE I A street in Westminster Enter two

people Believe me sir she is the goodliest woman That ever lay by man which when the people Had the full view of such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest As loud and to as many tunes Hats cloaks Doublets I think flew up and had their faces Been loose this day they had been lost Such joy I never saw before Greatbellied women That had not half a week to go like rams In the old

At length her Grace rose and with modest paces Came to the altar where she kneeled and saintlike Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly Then rose again and bowed her to the people When by

Grace Out of the pain you suffered gave no ear tot QUEEN KATHERINE Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died If well he stepped before me happily For my example GRIFFITH Well the voice goes madam For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York and brought him forward As a man sorely tainted to his answer He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill He could not sit his mule QUEEN KATHERINE Alas poor man GRIFFITH At last with easy roads he came to Leicester Lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot With all his covent honourably received him To whom he gave these words O father abbot An old man broken with the storms of state Is come to lay his weary bones among ye Give him a little earth for charity So went to bed where eagerly his sickness Pursued him still and three nights after this About the hour of eight which he himself Foretold should be his last full of repentance Continual meditations tears and sorrows He gave his honours to the world again His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace QUEEN KATHERINE So may he rest His faults lie gently on him Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him And yet with charity He was a man Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking Himself with princes one that by suggestion Tied all the kingdom Simony was fairplay His own opinion was his law I th presence He would say untruths and be ever double Both in his words and meaning He was never But where he meant to ruin pitiful His promises were as he then was mighty But his performance as he is now nothing Of his own body he was ill and gave The clergy ill example GRIFFITH Noble madam Mens evil manners live in brass their virtues We write in water May it please your Highness To hear me speak his good now QUEEN KATHERINE Yes good Griffith I were malicious else GRIFFITH This Cardinal Though from an humble stock undoubtedly Was fashioned to much honour From his cradle He was a scholar and a ripe and good one Exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading Lofty and sour to them that loved him not But to those men that sought him sweet as summer And though he were unsatisfied in getting Which was a sin yet in bestowing madam He was most princely Ever witness for him Those twins of learning that he raised in you Ipswich and Oxford one of which fell with him Unwilling to outlive the good that did it The other though unfinished yet so famous So excellent in art and still so rising That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue His overthrow heaped happiness upon him For then and not till then he felt himself And found the blessedness of being little And to add greater honours to his age Than man could give him he died fearing God QUEEN KATHERINE After my death I wish no other herald No other speaker of my living actions To keep mine honour from corruption But such an honest chronicler as Griffith Whom I most hated living thou hast made me With thy religious truth and modestyNow in his ashes honour Peace be with him Patience be near me still and set me lower I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith Cause the musicians play me that sad note I named my knell whilst I sit meditating On that celestial harmony I go to Sad and solemn music GRIFFITH She is asleep Good wench lets sit down quiet For fear we wake her Softly gentle Patience The vision Enter solemnly tripping one after another six Personages clad in white robes wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in their hands They first congee unto her then dance and at certain changes the first two hold a spare garland over her head at which the other four make reverent curtsies Then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two who observe the same order in their changes and holding the garland over her head which done they deliver the same garland to the last two who likewise observe the same order At which as it were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven And so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them The music continues QUEEN KATHERINE Spirits of peace where are ye Are ye all gone And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye GRIFFITH Madam we are here QUEEN KATHERINE It is not you I call for Saw ye none enter since I slept GRIFFITH None madam QUEEN KATHERINE No Saw you not even now a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun They promised me eternal happiness And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly GRIFFITH I am most joyful madam such good dreams Possess your fancy QUEEN KATHERINE Bid the music leave They are harsh and heavy to me Music ceases PATIENCE Do you note How much her Grace is altered on the sudden

if your highness should intend to sleep And charge that no man should disturb your rest In pain of your dislike or pain of death Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue That slyly glided towards your majesty It were but necessary you were waked Lest being suffered in that harmful slumber The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal And therefore do they cry though you forbid That they will guard you wheer you will or no From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is With whose envenomed and fatal sting Your loving uncle twenty times his worth They say is shamefully bereft of life COMMONS Within An answer from the King my Lord of SalisburySUFFOLK Tis like the commons rude unpolished hinds Could send such message to their sovereign But you my lord were glad to be employed To show how quaint an orator you are But all the honour Salisbury hath won Is that he was the lord ambassador Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King COMMONS Within An answer from the King or we will all break in KING HENRY Go Salisbury and tell them all from me I thank them for their tender loving care And had I not been cited so by them Yet did I purpose as they do entreat For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy Mischance unto my state by Suffolks means And therefore by His majesty I swear Whose far unworthy deputy I am He shall not breathe infection in this air

for him Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath Had I but said I would have kept my word But when I swear it is irrevocable If after three days space thou here best found On any ground that I am ruler of The world shall not be ransom for thy life Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me I have great matters to impart to thee Exeunt all but Queen and Suffolk QUEEN MARGARET Mischance and sorrow go along with you Hearts discontent and sour affliction Be playfellows to keep you company Theres two of you the devil make a third And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps SUFFOLK Cease gentle Queen these execrations And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave QUEEN MARGARET Fie coward woman and softhearted wretch Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemies SUFFOLK A plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them Could curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan I would invent as bitter searching terms As curst as harsh and horrible to hear Delivered strongly through my fixed teeth With full as many signs of deadly hate As leanfaced Envy in her loathsome cave My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint Mine hair be fixed on end as one distract Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban And even now my burdened heart would break Should I not curse them Poison be their drink Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste Their sweetest shade a grove of cypresstrees Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks Their softest touch as smart as lizards stings Their music frightful as the serpents hiss And boding screechowls make the consort full All the foul terrors in darkseated hell QUEEN MARGARET Enough sweet Suffolk thou tormentst thyself And these dread curses like the sun gainst glass Or like an overcharged gun recoil And turns the force of them upon thyself SUFFOLK You bade me ban and will you bid me leave Now by the ground that I am banished from Well could I curse away a winters night

souls treasure Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee And with the southern clouds contend in tears Theirs for the earths increase mine for my sorrows Now get thee hence The King thou knowst is coming If thou be found by me thou art but dead SUFFOLK If I depart from thee I cannot live And in thy sight to die what were it else But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap Here could I breathe my soul into

Suffolk disguised a prisoner The Master a Masters Mate Walter Whitmore and prisoners LIEUTENANT The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day Is crept into the bosom of the sea And now loudhowling wolves arouse the jades That drag the tragic melancholy night Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings Clip dead mens graves and from their misty jaws Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs Here shall they make their ransom on the sand Or with their blood stain this discoloured shore Master this prisoner freely give I thee And thou that art his mate make boot of this The other Walter Whitmore is thy share 1 GENTLEMAN What is my ransom master Let me know MASTER A thousand crowns or else lay down your head MATE And so much shall you give or off goes yours LIEUTENANT What think you much to pay two thousand crowns And bear the name and port of gentlemen Cut both the villains throatsfor die you shall The lives of those which we have lost in fight Be counterpoised with such a petty sum 1 GENTLEMAN Ill give it sir and therefore spare my life 2 GENTLEMAN And so will I and write home for it straight WHITMORE To Suffolk I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die And so should these if I might have my will LIEUTENANT Be not so rash take ransom let him live SUFFOLK Look on my George I am a gentleman Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid WHITMORE And so am I my name is Walter Whitmore How now Why starts thou What doth death affright SUFFOLK Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death A cunning man did calculate my birth And told me that by water I should die Yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded Thy name is Gaultier being rightly sounded WHITMORE Gaultier or Walter which it is I care not Never yet did base dishonour blur our name But with our sword we wiped away the blot Therefore when merchantlike I sell revenge Broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced And I proclaimed a coward through the world SUFFOLK Stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole WHITMORE The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags SUFFOLK Ay but these rags are no part of the Duke Jove sometime went disguised and why not I LIEUTENANT But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be SUFFOLK Obscure and lowly swain King Henrys blood The honourable blood of Lancaster Must not be shed by such a jaded groomHast thou not kissed thy hand and held my stirrup Bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule And thought thee happy when I shook my head How often hast thou waited at my cup Fed from my trencher kneeled down at the board When I have feasted with Queen Margaret Remember it and let it make thee crestfallen Ay and allay thus thy abortive pride How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood And duly waited for my coming forth This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue WHITMORE Speak captain shall I stab the forlorn swain LIEUTENANT First let my words stab him as he hath me SUFFOLK Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou LIEUTENANT Convey him hence and on our longboats side Strike off his head SUFFOLK Thou darst not for thy own LIEUTENANT Yes poll SUFFOLK Pole LIEUTENANT Pool Sir Pool Lord Ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt Troubles the silver spring where England drinks Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth For swallowing the treasure of the realm Thy lips that kissed the Queen shall sweep the ground And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphreys death Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again And wedded be thou to the hags of hell For daring to affy a mighty lord Unto the daughter of a worthless king Having neither subject wealth nor diadem By devilish policy art thou grown great And like ambitious Sylla overgorged With gobbets of thy mothers bleeding heart By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France The false revolting Normans thorough thee Disdain to call us lord and Picardy Hath slain their governors surprised our forts And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home The princely Warwick and the Nevilles all Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain As hating thee are rising up in arms And now the house of York thrust from the crown By shameful murder of a guiltless king And lofty proud encroaching tyranny Burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours Advance our halffaced sun striving to shine Under the which is writ Invitis nubibus The commons here in Kent are up in arms And to conclude reproach and beggary Is crept into the palace of our King And all by theeAway Convey him hence SUFFOLK O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder Upon these paltry servile abject drudges Small things make base men proud This villain here Being captain of a pinnace threatens more Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate Drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives It is impossible that I should die By such a lowly vassal as thyself Thy words move rage and not remorse in me I go of message from the Queen to France I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel LIEUTENANT Walter WHITMORE Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death SUFFOLK Pene gelidus timor occupat artus It is thee I fear WHITMORE Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee What are ye daunted now Now will ye stoop 1 GENTLEMAN My gracious lord entreat him speak him fair SUFFOLK Suffolks imperial tongue is stern and rough Used to command untaught to plead for favour Far be it we should honour such as these With humble suit No rather let my head Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any Save to the God of heaven and to my King And sooner dance upon a bloody pole Than stand uncovered to the vulgar groom True nobility is exempt from fear More can I bear than you dare execute LIEUTENANT Hale him away and let him talk no more SUFFOLK Come soldiers show what cruelty ye can That this my death may never be forgot Great men oft die by vile Bezonians A Roman sworder and banditto slave Murdered sweet Tully Brutus bastard hand Stabbed Julius Caesar savage islanders Pompey

our welldealing countrymen Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives Have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods Excludes all pity from our threatning looks For since the mortal and intestine jars Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay more if any born at Ephesus Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs Again if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to

with the evening sun DUKE Well Syracusian say in brief the cause Why thou departedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camst to Ephesus EGEON A heavier task could not have been imposd Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable Yet that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature not by vile offence Ill utter what my sorrow gives me leave In Syracusa was I born and wed Unto a woman happy but for me And by me had not our hap been bad With her I livd in joy our wealth increasd By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum till my factors death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons And which was strange the one so like the other As could not be distinguishd but by names That very hour and in the selfsame inn A mean woman was delivered Of such a burden male twins both alike Those for their parents were exceeding poor I bought and brought up to attend my sons My wife not meanly proud of two such boys Made daily motions for our home return Unwilling I agreed alas too soon We came aboard A league from Epidamnum had we saild Before the alwayswindobeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm But longer did we not retain much hope For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death Which though myself would gladly have embracd Yet the incessant weepings of my wife Weeping before for what she saw must come And piteous plainings of the pretty babes That mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear Forcd me to seek delays for them and me And this it was for other means was none The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship then sinkingripe to us My wife more careful for the latterborn Had fastned him unto a small spare mast Such as seafaring men provide for storms To him one of the other twins was bound Whilst I had been like heedful of the other The children thus disposd my wife and I Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd Fastned ourselves at either end the mast And floating straight obedient to the stream Was carried towards Corinth as we thought At length the sun gazing upon the earth Dispersd those vapours that offended us And by the benefit of his wished light The seas waxd calm and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this But ere they cameO let me say no more Gather the sequel by that went before DUKE Nay forward old man do not break off so For we may pity though not pardon thee EGEON O had the gods done so I had not now Worthily termd them merciless to us For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues We were encountered by a mighty rock Which being violently borne upon Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst So that in this unjust divorce of us Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in what to sorrow for Her part poor soul seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe Was carried with more speed before the wind And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth as we thought At length another ship had seizd on us And knowing whom it was their hap to save Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrackd guests And would have reft the fishers of their prey Had not their bark been very slow of sail And therefore homeward did they bend their course Thus have you heard me severd from my bliss That by misfortunes was my life prolongd To tell sad stories of my own mishaps DUKE And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for Do me the favour to dilate at full What have befalln of them and thee till now EGEON My youngest boy and yet my eldest care At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother and importund me That his attendant so his case was like Reft of his brother but retaind his name Might bear him company in the quest of him Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see I hazarded the loss of whom I lovd Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia And coasting homeward came to Ephesus Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men But here must end the story of my life And happy were I in my timely death Could all my travels warrant me they live DUKE Hapless Egeon whom the fates have markd To bear the extremity of dire mishap Now trust me were it not against our laws Against my crown my oath my dignity Which princes would they may not disannul My soul should sue as advocate

QUEEN TO KING RICHARD DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER DUCHESS OF YORK Lady attending on the Queen Lords Heralds Officers Soldiers Gardeners Keeper Messenger Groom and other Attendants SCENE Dispersedly in England and Wales ACT I SCENE I London A Room in the palace Enter King Richard John of Gaunt with other Nobles and Attendants KING RICHARD Old John of Gaunt timehonoured Lancaster Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boistrous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray GAUNT I have my liege KING RICHARD Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in him GAUNT As near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aimed at your Highness no inveterate malice KING RICHARD Then call them to our presence Face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak Highstomached are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire Enter Bolingbroke and Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign my most loving liege MOWBRAY Each day still better others happiness Until the heavens envying earths good hap Add an immortal title to your crown KING RICHARD We thank you both Yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray BOLINGBROKE Firstheaven be the record to my speech In the devotion of a subjects love Tendring the precious safety of my prince And free from other misbegotten hate Come I appellant to this princely presence Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to be so and too bad to live Since the more fair and crystal is the sky The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly Once more the more to aggravate the note With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat And wish so please my sovereign ere I move What my tongue speaks my rightdrawn sword may prove MOWBRAY Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal Tis not the trial of a womans war The bitter clamour of two eager tongues Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cooled for this Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hushed and naught at all to say First the fair reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had returned These terms of treason doubled down his throat Setting aside his high bloods royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Wherever Englishman durst set his foot Meantime let this defend my loyalty By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie BOLINGBROKE Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the King And lay aside my high bloods royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honours pawn then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise MOWBRAY I take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder Ill answer thee in any fair degree Or chivalrous design of knightly trial And when I mount alive may I not light If I be traitor or unjustly fight KING RICHARD What doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays charge It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him BOLINGBROKE Look what I speak my life shall prove it true That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your highness soldiers The which he hath detained for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain Besides I say and will in battle prove Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was surveyed by English eye That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death Suggest his soonbelieving adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood like sacrificing Abels cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spent KING RICHARD How high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this MOWBRAY O let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men hate so foul a liar KING RICHARD Mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears Were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir As he is but my fathers brothers son Now by my sceptres awe I make a vow Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul He is our subject Mowbray so art thou Free speech and fearless I to thee allow MOWBRAY Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disbursed I duly to his highness soldiers The other part reserved I by consent For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account Since last I went to France to fetch his queen Now swallow down that lie For Gloucesters death I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case For you my noble Lord of Lancaster The honourable father to my foeOnce did I lay an ambush for your life A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last received the sacrament I did confess it and exactly begged Your Graces pardon and I hope I had it This is my fault As for the rest appealed It issues from the rancour of a villain A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitors foot To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom In haste whereof most heartily I pray Your highness to assign our trial day KING RICHARD Wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me Lets purge this choler without letting blood This we prescribe though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed Good uncle let this end where it begun Well calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son GAUNT To be a makepeace shall become my"

soldier who hath relievd you FRANCISCO Barnardo has my place Give you goodnight Exit MARCELLUS Holla Barnardo BARNARDO Say what is Horatio there HORATIO A piece of him BARNARDO Welcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus MARCELLUS What has this thing appeard again tonight BARNARDO I have seen nothing MARCELLUS Horatio says tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it HORATIO Tush tush twill not appear BARNARDO Sit down awhile And let us once again assail your ears That are so fortified against our story What we two nights have seen HORATIO Well sit we down And let us hear Barnardo speak of this BARNARDO Last night of all When yond same star thats westward from the pole Had made his course tillume that part of heaven Where now it burns Marcellus and myself The bell then beating one MARCELLUS Peace break thee off Look where it comes again Enter Ghost BARNARDO In the same figure like the King thats dead MARCELLUS Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio BARNARDO Looks it not like the King Mark it Horatio HORATIO Most like It harrows me with fear and wonder BARNARDO It would be spoke to MARCELLUS Question it Horatio HORATIO What art thou that usurpst this time of night

Before my God I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes MARCELLUS Is it not like the King HORATIO As thou art to thyself Such was the very armour he had on When he thambitious Norway combated So frownd he once when in an angry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice Tis strange MARCELLUS Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch HORATIO In what particular thought to work I know not But in the gross and scope of my opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our state MARCELLUS Good now sit down and tell me he that knows Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week What might be toward that this sweaty haste Doth make the night jointlabourer with the day Who ist that can inform me HORATIO That can I At least the whisper goes so Our last King Whose image even but now appeard to us Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride Dard to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet For so this side of our known world esteemd him Did slay this Fortinbras who by a seald compact Well ratified by law and heraldry Did forfeit with his life all those his lands Which he stood seizd of to the conqueror Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our King which had returnd To the inheritance of Fortinbras Had he been vanquisher as by the same covnant And carriage of the article designd His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras Of unimproved mettle hot and full Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes For food and diet to some enterprise That hath a stomach int which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to recover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands So by his father lost And this I take it Is the main motive of our preparations The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this posthaste and rummage in the land BARNARDO I think it be no other but een so Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King That was and is the question of these wars HORATIO A mote it is to trouble the minds eye In the most high and palmy state of Rome A little ere the mightiest Julius fell The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood Disasters in the sun and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse And even the like precurse of fierce events As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen Reenter Ghost But soft behold Lo where it comes again Ill cross it though it blast me Stay illusion If thou hast any sound or use of voice Speak to me If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me Speak to me If thou art privy to thy countrys fate Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth For which they say you spirits oft walk in death Speak of it Stay and speak The cock crows Stop it Marcellus MARCELLUS Shall I strike at it with my partisan HORATIO Do if it will not stand BARNARDO Tis here HORATIO Tis here Exit Ghost MARCELLUS Tis gone We do it wrong being so majestical To offer it the show of violence For it is as the air invulnerable And our vain blows malicious mockery BARNARDO It was about to speak when the cock crew HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons I have heard The cock that is the trumpet to the morn Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat Awake the god of day and at his warning Whether in sea or fire in earth or air Thextravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine And of the truth herein This present object made probation MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock Some say that ever gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated The bird of dawning singeth all night long And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad The nights are wholesome then no planets strike No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm So hallowd and so gracious is the time HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it But look the morn in russet mantle clad Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill Break we our watch up and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet for upon my life This spirit dumb to us will speak to him Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it As needful in our loves fitting our duty MARCELLUS Lets dot I pray and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently Exeunt SCENE II Elsinore A room of state in the Castle Enter Claudius King of Denmark Gertrude the Queen Hamlet Polonius Laertes Voltemand Cornelius Lords and Attendant KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death The memory be green and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves Therefore our sometime sister now our queen Thimperial jointress to this warlike state Have we as twere with a defeated joy With one auspicious and one dropping eye With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage In equal scale weighing delight and dole Taken to wife nor have we herein barrd Your better wisdoms which have freely gone With this affair along For all our thanks Now follows that you know young Fortinbras Holding a weak supposal of our worth Or thinking by our late dear brothers death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame Colleagued with this dream of his advantage He hath not faild to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father with all bonds of law To our most valiant brother So much for him Now for ourself and for this time of meeting Thus much the business is we have here writ To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears Of this his nephews purpose to suppress His further gait herein in that the levies The lists and full proportions are all made Out of his subject and we here dispatch You good Cornelius and you Voltemand For bearers of this greeting to old Norway Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow Farewell and let your haste commend your duty CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND In that and all things will we show our duty KING We doubt it nothing heartily farewell Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius And now Laertes whats the news with you You told us of some suit What ist Laertes You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes That shall not be my offer not thy asking The head is not more native to the heart The hand more instrumental to the mouth Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father What wouldst thou have Laertes LAERTES Dread my lordYour leave and favour to return to France From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation Yet now I must confess that duty done My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon KING Have you your fathers leave What says Polonius POLONIUS He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition and at last Upon his will I seald my hard consent I do beseech you give him leave to go KING Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine And thy best graces spend it at thy will But now my cousin Hamlet and my son HAMLET Aside A little more than kin and less than kind KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you HAMLET Not so my lord I am too much i the sun QUEEN Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust Thou knowst tis common all that lives must die Passing through nature to eternity HAMLET Ay madam it is common QUEEN If it be Why seems it so particular with thee HAMLET Seems madam Nay it is I know not seems Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother Nor customary suits of solemn black Nor windy suspiration of forcd breath No nor the fruitful river in the eye Nor the dejected haviour of the visage Together with all forms moods shows of grief That can denote me truly These indeed seem For they are actions that a man might play But I have that within which passeth show These but the trappings and the suits of woe KING Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet To give these mourning duties to your father But you must know your father lost a father That father lost lost his and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow But to persevere In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness Tis unmanly grief It shows a will most incorrect to heaven A heart unfortified a mind impatient An understanding simple and unschoold For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaven A fault against the dead a fault to nature To reason most absurd whose common theme Is death of fathers and who still hath cried From the first corse till he that died today This must be so We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe and think of us As of a father for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg It is most retrograde to our desire And we beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son QUEEN Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you madam KING Why tis a loving and a fair reply Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come This gentle and unforcd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof No jocund health that Denmark drinks today But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell And the Kings rouse the heaven shall bruit again Respeaking earthly thunder Come away Exeunt all but Hamlet HAMLET O that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew Or that the Everlasting had not fixd His canon gainst selfslaughter O God O God How weary stale flat and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world Fie ont Oh fie tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely That it should come to this But two months deadnay not so much not two So excellent a king that was to this Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth Must I remember Why she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on and yet within a month Let me not think ontFrailty thy name is woman A little month or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor fathers body Like Niobe all tearsWhy she even she O God A beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mournd longermarried with mine uncle My fathers brother but no more like my father Than I to Hercules Within a month Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes She married O most wicked speed to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets It is not nor it cannot come to good But break my heart for I must hold my tongue Enter Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo HORATIO Hail to your lordship HAMLET I am glad to see you well Horatio or I do forget myself HORATIO The same my lord And your poor servant ever HAMLET Sir my good friend Ill change that name with you And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio Marcellus MARCELLUS My good lord HAMLET I am very glad to see youGood even sir But what in faith make you from Wittenberg HORATIO A truant disposition good my lord HAMLET I would not hear your enemy say so Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself I know you are no truant But what is your affair in Elsinore Well teach you to drink deep ere you depart HORATIO My lord I came to see your fathers funeral HAMLET I prithee do not mock me fellowstudent I think it was to see my mothers wedding HORATIO Indeed my lord it followd hard upon HAMLET Thrift thrift Horatio The funeral bakd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day Horatio My fathermethinks I see my father HORATIO Where my lord HAMLET In my minds eye Horatio HORATIO I saw him once he was a goodly king HAMLET He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon his like again HORATIO My lord I think I saw him yesternight HAMLET Saw Who HORATIO My lord the King your father HAMLET The King my father HORATIO Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you HAMLET For Gods love let me hear HORATIO Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus and Barnardo on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night Been thus encounterd A figure like your father Armed at point exactly cappie Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd By their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes Within his truncheons length whilst they distilld Almost to jelly with the act of fear Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did And I with them the third night kept the watch Where as they had deliverd both in time Form of the thing each word made true and good The apparition comes I knew your father These hands are not more like HAMLET But where was this MARCELLUS My lord upon the platform where we watch HAMLET Did you not speak to it HORATIO My lord I did But answer made it none yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion like as it would speak But even then the morning cock crew loud And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanishd from our sight HAMLET Tis very strange HORATIO As I do live my honourd lord tis true And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it HAMLET Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me Hold you the watch tonight MARCELLUS and BARNARDO We do my lord HAMLET Armd say you Both Armd my lord HAMLET From top to toe BOTH My lord from head to foot HAMLET Then saw you not his face HORATIO O yes my lord he wore his beaver up HAMLET What lookd he frowningly HORATIO A countenance more in sorrow than in anger HAMLET Pale or red HORATIO Nay very pale HAMLET And fixd his eyes upon you HORATIO Most constantly HAMLET I would I had been there HORATIO It would have much amazd you HAMLET Very like very like Stayd it long HORATIO While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred MARCELLUS and BARNARDO Longer

majesty Atalantas better part Sad Lucretias modesty Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised Of many faces eyes and hearts To have the touches dearest prized Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave ROSALIND O most gentle Jupiter what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried Have patience good people CELIA How now Back friends Shepherd go off a little Go with him sirrah TOUCHSTONE Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage Exeunt Corin and Touchstone CELIA Didst thou hear these verses ROSALIND O yes I heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear CELIA Thats no matter The feet might bear the verses ROSALIND Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse CELIA But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ROSALIND I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what I found on a palmtree I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras time that I was an Irish rat which I can hardly remember CELIA Trow you who hath done this ROSALIND Is it a man CELIA And a chain that you once wore about his neck Change you colour ROSALIND I prithee who CELIA O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter ROSALIND Nay but who is it CELIA Is it possible ROSALIND Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is CELIA O wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping ROSALIND Good my complexion Dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in my disposition One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace I would thou couldst stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of narrowmouthed bottleeither too much at once or none at all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings CELIA So you may put a man in your belly ROSALIND Is he of Gods making What manner of man Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard CELIA Nay he hath but a little beard ROSALIND Why God will send more if the man will be thankful Let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin CELIA It is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestlers heels and your heart both in an instant ROSALIND Nay but the devil take mocking Speak sad brow and true maid CELIA I faith coz tis he ROSALIND Orlando CELIA Orlando ROSALIND Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and hose What did he when thou sawst him What said he How looked he Wherein went he What makes he here Did he ask for me Where remains he How parted he with thee And when shalt thou see him again Answer me in one word CELIA You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first Tis a word too great for any mouth of this ages size To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism ROSALIND But doth he know that I am in this forest and in mans apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled CELIA It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover But take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn ROSALIND It may well be called Joves tree when it drops forth such fruit CELIA Give me audience good madam ROSALIND Proceed CELIA There lay he stretched along like a wounded knight ROSALIND Though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground CELIA Cry holla to thy tongue I prithee It curvets unseasonably He was furnished like a hunter ROSALIND O ominous He comes to kill my heart CELIA I would sing my song without a burden Thou bringst me out of tune ROSALIND Do you not know I am a woman When I think I must speak Sweet say on Enter Orlando and Jaques CELIA You bring me out Soft comes he not here ROSALIND Tis he Slink by and note him Rosalind and Celia step aside JAQUES I thank you for your company but good faith I had as lief have been myself alone ORLANDO And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you too for your society JAQUES God be wi you lets meet as little as we can ORLANDO I do desire we may be better strangers JAQUES I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks ORLANDO I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them illfavouredly JAQUES Rosalind is your loves name ORLANDO Yes just JAQUES I do not like her name ORLANDO There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened JAQUES What stature is she of ORLANDO Just as high as my heart JAQUES You are full of pretty answers Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them out of rings ORLANDO Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions JAQUES You have a nimble wit I think twas made of Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery ORLANDO I will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom I know most faults JAQUES The worst fault you have is to be in love ORLANDO Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue I am weary of you JAQUES By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found you ORLANDO He is drowned in the brook Look but in and you shall see him JAQUES There I shall see mine own figure ORLANDO Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher JAQUES Ill tarry no longer with you Farewell good Signior Love ORLANDO I am glad of your departure Adieu good Monsieur Melancholy Exit JaquesCelia and Rosalind come forward ROSALIND I will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him Do you hear forester ORLANDO Very well What would you ROSALIND I pray you what ist oclock ORLANDO You should ask me what time o day Theres no clock in the forest ROSALIND Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock ORLANDO And why not the swift foot of time Had not that been as proper ROSALIND By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with divers persons Ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal ORLANDO I prithee who doth he trot withal ROSALIND Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized If the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year ORLANDO Who ambles time withal ROSALIND With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These time ambles withal ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal ROSALIND With a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there ORLANDO Who stays it still withal ROSALIND With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves ORLANDO Where dwell you pretty youth ROSALIND With this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat ORLANDO Are you native of this place ROSALIND As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindledORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling ROSALIND I have been told so of many But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ROSALIND There were none principal They were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it ORLANDO I prithee recount some of them ROSALIND No I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind If I could meet that fancymonger I would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him ORLANDO I am he that is so loveshaked I pray you tell me your remedy ROSALIND There is none of my uncles marks upon you He taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner ORLANDO What were his marks ROSALIND A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have notbut I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue Then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man You are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other ORLANDO Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love ROSALIND Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired ORLANDO I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much ROSALIND Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so ROSALIND Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic And thus I cured him and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart that there shall not be one spot of love in t ORLANDO I would not be cured youth ROSALIND I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me ORLANDO Now by the faith of my love I will Tell me where it is ROSALIND Go with me to it and Ill show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you go ORLANDO With all my heart good youth ROSALIND Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go Exeunt SCENE III Another part of the Forest Enter Touchstone and Audrey Jaques at a distance observing them TOUCHSTONE Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your goats Audrey And how Audrey Am I the man yet Doth my simple feature content you AUDREY Your features Lord warrant us What features TOUCHSTONE I am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths JAQUES Aside O knowledge illinhabited worse than Jove in a thatched house TOUCHSTONE When a mans verses cannot be understood nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room Truly I would the gods had made thee poetical AUDREY I do not know what poetical is Is it honest in deed and word Is it a true thing TOUCHSTONE No truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign AUDREY Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical TOUCHSTONE I do truly for thou swearst to me thou art honest Now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst feign AUDREY Would you not have me honest TOUCHSTONE No truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar JAQUES Aside A material fool AUDREY Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me honest TOUCHSTONE Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish AUDREY I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul TOUCHSTONE Well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may be I will marry thee And to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us JAQUES Aside I would fain see this meeting AUDREY Well the gods give us joy TOUCHSTONE Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts But what though Courage As horns are odious they are necessary It is said Many a man knows no end of his goods Right Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting Horns Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man therefore blessed No As a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor And by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want Enter Sir Oliver Martext Here comes Sir Oliver Sir Oliver Martext you are well met Will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel MARTEXT Is there none here to give the woman TOUCHSTONE I will not take her on gift of any man MARTEXT Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful JAQUES Coming forward Proceed proceed Ill give her TOUCHSTONE Good even good Master Whatyecallt how do you sir You are very well met God ild you for your last company I am very glad to see you Even a toy in hand here sir Nay pray be covered JAQUES Will you be married motley TOUCHSTONE As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling JAQUES And will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar Get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp TOUCHSTONE Aside I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife JAQUES Go thou with me and let me counsel thee TOUCHSTONE Come sweet Audrey We must be married or we must live in bawdry Farewell good Master Oliver Not O sweet Oliver O brave Oliver Leave me not behind thee But Wind away Begone I say I will not to wedding with thee Exeunt Touchstone Audrey and Jaques MARTEXT Tis no matter Neer a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling Exit SCENE IV Another part of the Forest Before a Cottage Enter Rosalind and Celia ROSALIND Never talk to me I will weep CELIA Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man ROSALIND But have I not cause to weep CELIA As good cause as one would desire therefore weep ROSALIND His very hair is of the dissembling colour CELIA Something browner than Judass Marry his kisses are Judass own children ROSALIND I faith his hair is of a good colour CELIA An excellent colour Your chestnut was ever the only colour ROSALIND And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread CELIA He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana A nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them ROSALIND But why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not CELIA Nay certainly there is no truth in him ROSALIND Do you think so CELIA Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horsestealer but for his verity in love I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a wormeaten nut ROSALIND Not true in love CELIA Yes when he is in but I think he is not in ROSALIND You have heard him swear downright he was CELIA Was is not is Besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster They are both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father ROSALIND I met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him He asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando CELIA O thats a brave man He writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose But alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides Who comes hereEnter Corin CORIN Mistress and master you have oft enquired After the shepherd that complained of love Who you saw sitting by me on the turf Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress CELIA Well and what of him CORIN If you will see a pageant truly played Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain Go hence a little and I shall conduct you If you will mark it ROSALIND O come let us remove The sight of lovers feedeth those in love Bring us to this sight and you shall say Ill prove a busy actor in their play Exeunt SCENE V Another part of the Forest Enter Silvius and Phoebe SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe do not scorn me do not Phoebe Say that you love me not but say not so In bitterness The common executioner Whose heart th accustomed sight of death makes hard Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon Will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops Enter Rosalind Celia and Corin at a distance PHOEBE I would not be thy executioner I fly thee for I would not injure thee Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye Tis pretty sure and very probable That eyes that are the frailst and softest things Who shut their coward gates on atomies Should be called tyrants butchers murderers Now I do frown on thee with all my heart And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains Some scar of it lean upon a rush The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps But now mine eyes Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes That can do hurt SILVIUS O dear Phoebe If everas that ever may be near You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy Then shall you know the wounds invisible That loves keen arrows make PHOEBE But till that time Come not thou near me And when that time comes Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not As till that time I shall not pity thee ROSALIND Advancing And why I pray you Who might be your mother That you insult exult and all at once Over the wretched What though you have no beauty As by my faith I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed Must you be therefore proud and pitiless Why what means this Why do you look on me I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of natures salework Ods my little life I think she means to tangle my eyes too No faith proud mistress hope not after it Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream That can entame my spirits to your worship You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman Tis such fools as you That makes the world full of illfavoured children Tis not her glass but you that flatters her And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her But mistress know yourself down on your knees And thank heaven fasting for a good mans love For I must tell you friendly in your ear Sell when you can you are not for all markets Cry the man mercy love him take his offer Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer So take her to thee shepherd Fare you well PHOEBE Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together I had rather hear you chide than this man woo ROSALIND Hes falln in love with your foulness and shell fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her with bitter words Why look you so upon me PHOEBE For no ill will I bear you ROSALIND I pray you do not fall in love with me For I am falser than vows made in wine Besides I like you not If you will know my house Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard Come sister Shepherdess look on him better And be not proud Though all the world could see None could be so abused in sight as he Come to our flock Exeunt Rosalind Celia and Corin PHOEBE Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might Who ever loved that loved not at first sight SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe PHOEBE Ha what sayst thou Silvius SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe pity me PHOEBE Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius SILVIUS Wherever sorrow is relief would be If you do sorrow at my grief in love By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined PHOEBE Thou hast my love Is not that neighbourly SILVIUS I would have you PHOEBE Why that were covetousness Silvius the time was that I hated thee And yet it is not that I bear thee love But since that thou canst talk of love so well Thy company which erst was irksome to me I will endure and Ill employ thee too But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed SILVIUS So holy and so perfect is my love And I in such a poverty of grace That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps Loose now and then A scattered smile and that Ill live upon PHOEBE Knowst thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile SILVIUS Not very well but I have met him oft And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of PHOEBE Think not I love him though I ask for him Tis but a peevish boyyet he talks well But what care I for words Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear It is a pretty youthnot very pretty But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him Hell make a proper man The best thing in him Is his complexion and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall His leg is but soso and yet tis well There was a pretty redness in his lip A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek Twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask There be some women Silvius had they marked him In parcels as I did would have gone near To fall in love with him but for my part I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And now I am remembered scorned at me I marvel why I answered not again But thats all one omittance is no quittance Ill write to him a very taunting letter And thou shalt bear it Wilt thou Silvius SILVIUS Phoebe with all my heart PHOEBE Ill write it straight The matters in my head and in my heart I will be bitter with him and passing short Go with me Silvius Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I The Forest of Arden Enter Rosalind Celia and Jaques JAQUES I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards JAQUES Why tis good to be sad and say nothing ROSALIND Why then tis good to be a post JAQUES I have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands JAQUES Yes I have gained my experience ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sadand to travel for it too Enter Orlando ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind JAQUES Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller Look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Exit Jaques Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise ROSALIND Break an hours promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant him heartwhole ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snail ORLANDO Of a snail ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his heada better jointure I think than you make a woman Besides he brings his destiny with him ORLANDO Whats that ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife ORLANDO Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit ORLANDO What of my suit ROSALIND Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of herROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all ORLANDO And wilt thou have me ROSALIND Ay and twenty such ORLANDO What sayest thou ROSALIND Are you not good ORLANDO I hope so ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good thingCome sister you shall be the priest and marry usGive me your hand OrlandoWhat do you say sister ORLANDO Pray thee marry us CELIA I cannot say the words ROSALIND You must begin Will you Orlando CELIA Go toWill you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind ORLANDO I will ROSALIND Ay but when ORLANDO Why now as fast as she can marry us ROSALIND Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife ORLANDO I take thee Rosalind for wife ROSALIND I might ask you for your commission But I do take thee Orlando for my husband Theres a girl goes before the priest and certainly a womans thought runs before her actions ORLANDO So do all thoughts They are winged ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her ORLANDO For ever and a day ROSALIND Say a day without the ever No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed Maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyena and that when thou are inclined to sleep ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so ROSALIND By my life she will do as I do ORLANDO O but she is wise ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser the waywarder Make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement Shut that and twill out at the keyhole Stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say Wit whither wilt ROSALIND Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that ROSALIND Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool ORLANDO For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee ROSALIND Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours ORLANDO I must attend the Duke at dinner By two o"

touched They would not thread the gates This kind of service Did not deserve corn gratis Being i th war Their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed Most valour spoke not for them Th accusation Which they have often made against the Senate All cause unborn could never be the native Of our so frank donation Well what then How shall this bosom multitude digest The senates courtesy Let deeds express Whats like to be their words We did request it We are the greater poll and in true fear They gave us our demands Thus we debase The nature of our seats and make the rabble Call our cares fears

which for your best ends You adopt your policy how is it less or worse That it shall hold companionship in peace With honour as in war since that to both It stands in like request CORIOLANUS Why force you this VOLUMNIA Because that now it lies you on to speak To th people not by your own instruction Nor by th matter which your heart prompts you But with such words that are but rooted in Your tongue though but bastards and syllables Of no allowance to your bosoms truth Now this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake required I should do so in honour I am in this Your wife your son these senators the nobles And you will rather show our general louts How you can frown than spend a fawn upon em For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard Of what that want might ruin MENENIUS Noble lady Come go with us speak fair

ripest mulberry That will not hold the handling Or say to them Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess Were fit for thee to use as they to claim In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far As thou hast power and person MENENIUS This but done Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours For they have pardons being asked as free As words to little purpose VOLUMNIA Prithee now Go and be ruled although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower Enter Cominius Here is Cominius COMINIUS I have been i th marketplace and sir tis fit You make strong party or defend yourself By calmness or by absence Alls in anger MENENIUS Only fair speech COMINIUS I

choired with my drum into a pipe Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice That babies lulls asleep The smiles of knaves Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up The glasses of my sight A beggars tongue Make motion through my lips and my armed knees Who bowed but in my stirrup bend like his That hath received an alms I will not dot Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth And by my bodys action teach my mind A most inherent baseness VOLUMNIA At thy choice then To beg of thee it is my more dishonour Than thou of them Come all to ruin Let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death With as big heart as thou Do as thou list Thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me But owe thy pride thyself CORIOLANUS Pray be content Mother I am

praise ourselves Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm More longing wavering sooner lost and worn Than womens are VIOLA I think it well my lord DUKE Then let thy love be younger than thyself Or thy affection cannot hold the bent For women are as roses whose fair flower Being once displayd doth fall that very hour VIOLA And so they are alas that they are so To die even when they to perfection grow Enter Curio and Clown DUKE O fellow come the song we had last night Mark it Cesario it is old and plain The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with

Say that some lady as perhaps there is Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia you cannot love her You tell her so Must she not then be answerd DUKE There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart no womans heart So big to hold so much they lack retention Alas their love may be called appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia VIOLA Ay but I

This fellow is wise enough to play the fool And to do that well craves a kind of wit He must observe their mood on whom he jests The quality of persons and the time And like the haggard check at every

ring in chase of you So did I abuse Myself my servant and I fear me you Under your hard construction must I sit To force that on you in a shameful cunning Which you knew none of yours What might you

honour truth and everything I love thee so that maugre all thy pride Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide Do not extort thy reasons from this clause For that I woo thou therefore hast no cause But rather reason thus with reason fetter Love sought is good but given unsought is better VIOLA By innocence I swear and by my youth I have one heart one bosom and one truth And that no woman has nor never none Shall mistress be of it save I alone And so adieu good madam never more Will I my masters tears to you deplore OLIVIA Yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move That heart which now abhors

may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar IAGO Aside He takes her by the palm Ay well said whisper With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good well kissed an excellent courtesy Tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clysterpipes for your sake Trumpets within The Moor I know his trumpet CASSIO Tis truly so DESDEMONA Lets meet him and receive him CASSIO Lo where he comes Enter Othello and Attendants OTHELLO O my fair warrior DESDEMONA My dear Othello OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me O my souls joy If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have wakend death And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympushigh and duck again as low As hells from heaven If it were now to die Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate DESDEMONA The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow OTHELLO Amen to that sweet powers I cannot speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords be They kiss That eer our hearts shall make IAGO Aside O you are well tund now But Ill set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I am OTHELLO Come let us to the castle News friends our wars are done the Turks are drownd How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey you shall be well desird in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comfortsI prithee good Iago Go to the bay and disembark my coffers Bring thou the master to the citadel He is a good one and his worthiness Does challenge much respectCome Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprus Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants IAGO Do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come hither If thou best valiantas they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him RODERIGO With him Why tis not possible IAGO Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed And what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none A slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after A pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already RODERIGO I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition IAGO Blest figs end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that RODERIGO Yes that I did But that was but courtesy IAGO Lechery by this hand An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embracd together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight For the command Ill layt upon you Cassio knows you not Ill not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister RODERIGO Well IAGO Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell RODERIGO Adieu Exit IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evend with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash For his quick hunting stand the putting on Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and

exquisite lady IAGO And Ill warrant her full of game CASSIO Indeed she is a most fresh and delicate creature IAGO What an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley to provocation CASSIO An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest IAGO And when she speaks is it not an alarm to love CASSIO She is indeed perfection IAGO Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello CASSIO Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainmentIAGO O they are our friends but one cup Ill drink for you CASSIO I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more IAGO What man Tis a night of revels The gallants desire it CASSIO Where are they IAGO Here at the door I pray you call them in CASSIO Ill dot but it dislikes me Exit IAGO If I can fasten but one cup upon him With that which he hath drunk tonight already Hell be as full of quarrel and offence As my young mistress dog Now my sick fool Roderigo Whom love hath turnd almost the wrong side out To Desdemona hath tonight carousd Potations pottledeep and hes to watch Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits That hold their honours in a wary distance The very elements of this warlike isle Have I tonight flusterd with flowing cups And they watch too Now mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle But here they come If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely both with wind and stream Enter Cassio Montano and Gentlemen followed by Servant with wine CASSIO Fore God they have given me a rouse already MONTANO Good faith a little one not past a pint as I am a soldier IAGO Some wine ho Sings And let me the cannikin clink clink And let me the cannikin clink clink A soldiers a man O mans lifes but a span Why then let a soldier drink Some wine boys CASSIO Fore God an excellent song IAGO I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting your Dane your German and your swagbellied Hollanderdrink hoare nothing to your English CASSIO Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking IAGO Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled CASSIO To the health of our general MONTANO I am for it lieutenant and Ill do you justice IAGO O sweet England Sings King Stephen was a worthy peer His breeches cost him but a crown He held them sixpence all too dear With that he calld the tailor lown He was a wight of high renown And thou art but of low degree Tis pride that pulls the country down Then take thine auld cloak about thee Some wine ho CASSIO Fore God this is a more exquisite song than the other IAGO Will you hear t again CASSIO No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things Well Gods above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved IAGO Its true good lieutenant CASSIO For mine own part no offence to the general nor any man of quality I hope to be saved IAGO And so do I too lieutenant CASSIO Ay but by your

drunk This is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and I speak well enough ALL Excellent well CASSIO Why very well then You must not think then that I am drunk Exit MONTANO To the platform masters Come lets set the watch IAGO You see this fellow that is gone before He is a soldier fit to stand by Csar And give direction and do but see his vice Tis to his virtue a just equinox The one as long as th other Tis pity of him I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island MONTANO But is he often thus IAGO Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep Hell watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle MONTANO It were well The general were put in mind of it Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils is not this true Enter Roderigo IAGO Aside to him How now Roderigo I pray you after the lieutenant go Exit Roderigo MONTANO And tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity It were an honest action to say so To the Moor IAGO Not I for this

lieutenantsirMontanogentlemen Have you forgot all place of sense and duty Hold The general speaks to you hold hold for shame OTHELLO Why how now ho From whence ariseth this Are we turnd Turks and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety What is the matter masters Honest Iago that looks dead with grieving Speak who began this On thy love I charge thee IAGO I do not know Friends all but now even now In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed and then but now As if some planet had unwitted men Swords out and tilting one at others breast In opposition bloody I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it OTHELLO How comes it Michael you are thus forgot CASSIO I pray you pardon me I cannot speak OTHELLO Worthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure whats the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler Give me answer to it MONTANO Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger Your officer Iago can inform you While I spare speech which something now offends me Of all that I do know nor know I aught By me thats said or done amiss this night Unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us OTHELLO Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way Zounds if I stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approvd in this offence Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety Tis monstrous Iago who begant MONTANO If partially affind or leagud in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier IAGO Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determind sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamour as it so fell out The town might fall in fright he swift of foot Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I neer might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass OTHELLO I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine Enter Desdemona attended Look if my gentle love be not raisd up Ill make thee an example DESDEMONA Whats the matter OTHELLO Alls well now sweeting come away to bed Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon Lead him off Montano is led off Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted Come Desdemona tis the soldiers life To have their balmy slumbers wakd with strife Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio IAGO What are you hurt lieutenant CASSIO Ay past all surgery IAGO Marry Heaven forbid CASSIO Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation IAGO As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you CASSIO I know not IAGO Ist possible CASSIO I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains That we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beastsIAGO Why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself IAGO Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good CASSIO I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblessd and the ingredient is a devil IAGO Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love you CASSIO I have well approved it sirI drunk IAGO You or any man living may be drunk at a time man Ill tell you what you shall do Our generals wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her Importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before CASSIO You advise me well IAGO I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness CASSIO I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here IAGO You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch CASSIO Good night honest Iago Exit IAGO And whats he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit Shes framd as fruitful As the free elements And then for her To win the Moor weret to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetterd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now for whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor Ill pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her bodys lust And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all Enter Roderigo How now Roderigo RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice IAGO How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time Doest not go well Cassio hath beaten thee And thou by that small hurt hast cashierd Cassio Though other things grow fair against the sun Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe Content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee gone Exit Roderigo Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress Ill set her on Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife Ay thats the way Dull not device by coldness and delay Exit ACT III SCENE I Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Cassio and some Musicians CASSIO Masters play here I will content your pains Something thats brief and bid Good morrow general Music Enter Clown CLOWN Why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak i the nose thus FIRST MUSICIAN How sir how CLOWN Are these I pray you wind instruments FIRST MUSICIAN Ay marry are they sir

not greatly care FIRST MUSICIAN We have none such sir CLOWN Then put up your pipes in your bag for Ill away Go vanish into air away Exeunt Musicians CASSIO Dost thou hear mine honest friend CLOWN No I hear not your honest friend I hear you CASSIO Prithee keep up thy quillets Theres a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring tell her theres one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech Wilt thou do this CLOWN She is stirring sir if she will stir hither I shall seem to notify unto her CASSIO Do good my friend Exit Clown Enter Iago In happy time Iago IAGO You have not been abed then CASSIO Why no The day had broke Before we parted I have made bold Iago To send in to your wife My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access IAGO Ill send her to you presently And Ill devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way that your converse and business May be more free CASSIO I humbly thank you fort Exit Iago I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest Enter Emilia EMILIA Good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again CASSIO Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone EMILIA Pray you come in I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely CASSIO I am much bound to you Exeunt SCENE II Cyprus A Room in the Castle

will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were CASSIO Bounteous madam Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio Hes never anything but your true servant DESDEMONA I knowt I thank you You do love my lord You have known him long and be you well assurd He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distance CASSIO Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstance That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service DESDEMONA Do not doubt that Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee If I do vow a friendship Ill perform it To the last article My lord shall never rest Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift Ill intermingle everything he does With Cassios suit Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away Enter Othello and Iago EMILIA Madam here comes my lord CASSIO Madam Ill take my leave DESDEMONA Why stay and hear me speak CASSIO Madam not now I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes DESDEMONA Well do your discretion Exit Cassio IAGO Ha I like not that OTHELLO What dost thou say IAGO Nothing my lord or ifI know not what OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife IAGO Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike Seeing you coming OTHELLO I do believe twas he DESDEMONA How now my lord I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure OTHELLO Who ist you mean DESDEMONA Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back OTHELLO Went he hence now DESDEMONA Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him back OTHELLO Not now sweet Desdemon some other time DESDEMONA But shallt be shortly OTHELLO The sooner sweet for you DESDEMONA Shallt be tonight at supper OTHELLO No not tonight

prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith hes penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason Save that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath taen your part to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do much OTHELLO Prithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothingDESDEMONA Why this is not a boon Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee

thou say Iago IAGO Did Michael Cassio when you wood my lady Know of your love OTHELLO He did from first to last Why dost thou ask IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought No further harm OTHELLO Why of thy thought Iago IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her OTHELLO O yes and went between us very oft IAGO Indeed OTHELLO Indeed Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that Is he not honest IAGO Honest my lord OTHELLO Honest ay honest IAGO My lord for aught I know OTHELLO What dost thou think IAGO Think my lord OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou likst not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me Show me thy thought IAGO My lord you know I love you OTHELLO I think thou dost And for I know thourt full of love and honesty And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just Theyre close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule IAGO For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest OTHELLO I think so too IAGO Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem IAGO Why then I think Cassios an honest man OTHELLO Nay yet theres more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words IAGO Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As wheres that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear A stranger to thy thoughts IAGO I do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my natures plague To spy into abuses and of my jealousy Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts OTHELLO What dost thou mean IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed OTHELLO By heaven Ill know thy thoughts IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody OTHELLO Ha IAGO O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he oer Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves OTHELLO O misery IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy OTHELLO Why why is this Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolvd exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abusd Look tot I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience Is not to leave undone but keep unknown OTHELLO Dost thou say so IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most OTHELLO And so she did IAGO Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever IAGO I see this hath a little dashd your spirits OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot IAGO Trust me I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see youre movd I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion OTHELLO I will not IAGO Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend My lord I see youre movd OTHELLO No not much movd I do not think but Desdemonas honest IAGO Long live she so And long live you to think so OTHELLO And yet how nature erring from itself IAGO Ay theres the point As to be bold with you Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh One may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with"

court Hides not his visage from our cottage but Looks on alike To Florizel Willt please you sir be gone I told you what would come of this Beseech you Of your own state take care This dream of mine Being now awake Ill queen it no inch farther But milk my ewes and weep CAMILLO Why how now father Speak ere thou diest SHEPHERD I cannot speak nor think Nor dare to know that which I know O sir You have undone a man of fourscore three That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea To die upon the bed my father died To lie close by his honest bones but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay

all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse I would have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing no feeling but my sirs song and admiring the nothing of it So that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and

brain more busy than the labouring spider Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies Well nobles well tis politicly done To send me packing with an host of men I fear me you but warm the starved snake Who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts Twas men I lacked and you will give them me I take it kindly yet be well assured You put sharp weapons in a madmans hands Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band I will stir up in England some black storm Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage Until the golden circuit on my head Like to the glorious suns transparent beams Do calm the fury of this madbred flaw And for a minister of my intent I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman John Cade of Ashford To make commotion as full well he can Under the title of John Mortimer In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade Oppose himself against a troop of kerns And fought so long till that his thighs with darts Were almost like a sharpquilled porpentine And in the end being rescued I have seen Him caper upright like a wild Morisco Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells Full often like a shaghaired crafty kern Hath he conversed with the enemy And undiscovered come to me again And given me notice of their villainies This devil here shall be my substitute For that John Mortimer which now is dead In face in gait in speech he doth resemble By this I shall perceive the commons mind How they affect the house and claim of York Say he be taken racked and tortured I know no pain they can inflict upon him Will make him say I moved him to those arms Say that he thrive as tis great like he will Why then from Ireland come I with my strength And reap the harvest which that rascal sowed For Humphrey being dead as he shall be And Henry put apart the next for me Exit SCENE II Bury St Edmunds A Room of State Enter two or three Murderers running over the stage from the murder of Duke Humphrey 1 MURDERER Run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know We have dispatched the Duke as he commanded 2 MURDERER O that it were to do What have we done Didst ever hear a man so penitent Enter Suffolk 1 MURDERER Here comes my lord SUFFOLK Now sirs have you dispatched this thing 1 MURDERER Ay my good lord hes dead SUFFOLK Why thats well said Go get you to my house I will reward you for this venturous deed The King and all the

Queen Cardinal Beaufort Somerset with attendants KING HENRY Go call our uncle to our presence straight Say we intend to try his grace today If he be guilty as tis published SUFFOLK Ill call him presently my noble lord Exit KING HENRY Lords take your places and I pray you all Proceed no straiter gainst our uncle Gloucester Than from true evidence of good esteem He be approved in practice culpable QUEEN MARGARET God forbid any malice should prevail That faultless may condemn a nobleman Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion KING HENRY I thank thee Meg these words content me much Enter Suffolk How now Why lookst thou pale Why tremblest thou Where is our uncle Whats the matter Suffolk SUFFOLK Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead QUEEN MARGARET Marry God forfend CARDINAL Gods secret judgment I did dream tonight The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word The King swoons QUEEN MARGARET How fares my lord Help lords the King is dead SOMERSET Rear up his body wring him by the nose QUEEN MARGARET Run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes SUFFOLK He doth revive again Madam be patient KING HENRY O heavenly God QUEEN MARGARET How fares my gracious lord SUFFOLK Comfort my sovereign Gracious Henry comfort KING HENRY What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me Came he right now to sing a ravens note Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powersAnd thinks he that the chirping of a wren By crying comfort from a hollow breast Can chase away the firstconceived sound Hide not thy poison with such sugared words Lay not thy hands on me Forbear I say Their touch affrights me as a serpents sting Thou baleful messenger out of my sight Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny Sits in grim majesty to fright the world Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding Yet do not go away come basilisk And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight For in the shade of death I shall find joy In life but double death now Gloucesters dead QUEEN MARGARET Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus Although the Duke was enemy to him Yet he most Christianlike laments his death And for myself foe as he was to me Might liquid tears or heartoffending groans Or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life I would be blind with weeping sick with groans Look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs And all to have the noble Duke alive What know I how the world may deem of me For it is known we were but hollow friends It may be judged I made the Duke away So shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded And princes courts be filled with my reproach This get I by his death Ay me unhappy To be a queen and crowned with infamy KING HENRY Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man QUEEN MARGARET Be woe for me more wretched than he is What dost thou turn away and hide thy face I am no loathsome leper Look on me What art thou like the adder waxen deaf Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn Queen Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucesters tomb Why then Dame Margaret was neer thy joy Erect his statue and worship it And make my image but an alehouse sign Was I for this nigh wracked upon the sea And twice by awkward wind from Englands bank Drove back again unto my native clime What boded this but well forewarning wind Did seem to say Seek not a scorpions nest Nor set no footing on this unkind shore What did I then but cursed the gentle gusts And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves And bid them blow towards Englands blessed shore Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer But left that hateful office unto thee The prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me Knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness The splitting rocks cowered in the sinking sands And would not dash me with their ragged sides Because thy flinty heart more hard than they Might in thy palace perish Margaret As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs When from thy shore the tempest beat us back I stood upon the hatches in the storm And when the dusky sky began to rob My earnestgaping sight of thy lands view I took a costly jewel from my neck A heart it was bound in with diamonds And threw it towards thy land The sea received it And so I wished thy body might my heart And even with this I lost fair Englands view And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart And called them blind and dusky spectacles For losing ken of Albions wished coast How often have I tempted Suffolks tongue The agent of thy foul inconstancy To sit and witch me as Ascanius did When he to madding Dido would unfold His fathers acts commenced in burning Troy Am I not witched like her Or thou not false like him Ay me I can no more Die Margaret For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long Noise within Enter Warwick Salisbury and many Commons WARWICK It is reported mighty sovereign That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murdered By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beauforts means The commons like an angry hive of bees That want their leader scatter up and down And care not who they sting in his revenge Myself have calmed their spleenful mutiny Until they hear the order of his death KING HENRY That he is dead good Warwick tis too true But how he died God knows not Henry Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse And comment then upon his sudden death WARWICK That shall I do my liegeStay Salisbury With the rude multitude till I return Warwick exits through one door Salisbury and Commons exit through another KING HENRY O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul Some violent hands were laid on Humphreys life If my suspect be false forgive me God For judgment only doth belong to Thee Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips With twenty thousand kisses and to drain Upon his face an ocean of salt tears To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling But all in vain are these mean obsequies And to survey his dead and earthy image What were it but to make my sorrow greater Enter Warwick and others bearing Gloucesters body on a bed WARWICK Come hither gracious sovereign view this body KING HENRY That is to see how deep my grave is made For with his soul fled all my worldly solace For seeing him I see my life in death WARWICK As surely as my soul intends to live With that dread King that took our state upon Him To free us from His Fathers wrathful curse I do believe that violent hands were laid Upon the life of this thricefamed duke SUFFOLK A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow WARWICK See how the blood is settled in his face Oft have I seen a timelyparted ghost Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless Being all descended to the labouring heart Who in the conflict that it holds with death Attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy Which with the heart there cools and neer returneth To blush and beautify the cheek again But see his face is black and full of blood His eyeballs further out than when he lived Staring full ghastly like a strangled man His hair upreared his nostrils stretched with struggling His hands abroad displayed as one that grasped And tugged for life and was by strength subdued Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking His wellproportioned beard made rough and rugged Like to the summers corn by tempest lodged It cannot be but he was murdered here The least of all these signs were probable SUFFOLK Why Warwick who should do the Duke to death Myself and Beaufort had him in protection And we I hope sir are no murderers WARWICK But both of you were vowed Duke Humphreys foes And you forsooth had the good Duke to keep Tis like you would not feast him like a friend And tis well seen he found an enemy QUEEN MARGARET Then you belike suspect these noblemen As guilty of Duke Humphreys timeless death WARWICK Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh And sees fast by a butcher with an axe But will suspect twas he that made the slaughter Who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest But may imagine how the bird was dead Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak Even so suspicious is this tragedy QUEEN MARGARET Are you the butcher Suffolk Wheres your knife Is Beaufort termed a kite Where are his talons SUFFOLK I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men But heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart That slanders me with murders crimson badge Say if thou darst proud Lord of Warwickshire That I am faulty in Duke Humphreys death Exeunt Cardinal Somerset and others WARWICK What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him QUEEN MARGARET He dares not calm his contumelious spirit Nor cease to be an arrogant controller Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times WARWICK Madam be still with reverence may I say For every word you speak in his behalf Is slander to your royal dignity SUFFOLK Bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanour If ever lady wronged her lord so much Thy mother took into her blameful bed Some stern untutored churl and noble stock Was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art And never of the Nevilles noble race WARWICK But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee And I should rob the deathsman of his fee Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames And that my sovereigns presence makes me mild I would false murderous coward on thy knee Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech And say it was thy mother that thou meantst That thou thyself wast born in bastardy And after all this fearful homage done Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men SUFFOLK Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood If from this presence thou darst go with me WARWICK Away even now or I will drag thee hence Unworthy though thou art Ill cope with thee And do some service to Duke Humphreys ghost Exeunt Suffolk and Warwick KING HENRY What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just And he but naked though locked up in steel Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted A noise within QUEEN MARGARET What noise is this Enter Suffolk and Warwick with their weapons drawn KING HENRY Why how now lords Your wrathful weapons drawn Here in our presence Dare you be so bold Why what tumultuous clamour have we here SUFFOLK The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury Set all upon me mighty sovereign Enter Salisbury SALISBURY To the Commons entering Sirs stand apart the King shall know your mind Dread lord the commons send you word by me Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death Or banished fair Englands territories They will by violence tear him from your palace And torture him with grievous lingering death They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died They say in him they fear your highness death And mere instinct of love and loyalty Free from a stubborn opposite intent As being thought to contradict your liking Makes them thus forward in his banishment They say in care of your most royal person That if your highness should intend to sleep And charge that no man should disturb your rest In pain of your dislike or pain of death Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue That slyly glided towards your majesty It were but necessary you were waked Lest being suffered in that harmful slumber The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal And therefore do they cry though you forbid That they will guard you wheer you will or no From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is With whose envenomed and fatal sting Your loving uncle twenty times his worth They say is shamefully bereft of life COMMONS Within An answer from the King my Lord of SalisburySUFFOLK Tis like the commons rude unpolished hinds Could send such message to their sovereign But you my lord were glad to be employed To show how quaint an orator you are But all the honour Salisbury hath won Is that he was the lord ambassador Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King COMMONS Within An answer from the King or we will all break in KING HENRY Go Salisbury and tell them all from me I thank them for their tender loving care And had I not been cited so by them Yet did I purpose as they do entreat For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy Mischance unto my state by Suffolks means And therefore by His majesty I swear Whose far unworthy deputy I am He shall not breathe infection in this air But three days longer on the pain of death Exit Salisbury QUEEN MARGARET O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk KING HENRY Ungentle Queen to call him gentle Suffolk No more I say if thou dost plead for him Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath Had I but said I would have kept my word But when I swear it is irrevocable If after three days space thou here best found On any ground that I am ruler of The world shall not be ransom for thy life Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me I have great matters to impart to thee Exeunt all but Queen and Suffolk QUEEN MARGARET Mischance and sorrow go along with you Hearts discontent and sour affliction Be playfellows to keep you company Theres two of you the devil make a third And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps SUFFOLK Cease gentle Queen these execrations And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave QUEEN MARGARET Fie coward woman and softhearted wretch Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemies SUFFOLK A plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them Could curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan I would invent as bitter searching terms As curst as harsh and horrible to hear Delivered strongly through my fixed teeth With full as many signs of deadly hate As leanfaced Envy in her loathsome cave My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint Mine hair be fixed on end as one distract Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban And even now my burdened heart would break Should I not curse them Poison be their drink Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste Their sweetest shade a grove of cypresstrees Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks Their softest touch as smart as lizards stings Their music frightful as the serpents hiss And boding screechowls make the consort full All the foul terrors in darkseated hell QUEEN MARGARET Enough sweet Suffolk thou tormentst thyself And these dread curses like the sun gainst glass Or like an overcharged gun recoil And turns the force of them upon thyself SUFFOLK You bade me ban and will you bid me leave Now by the ground that I am banished from Well could I curse away a winters night Though standing naked on a mountain top Where biting cold would never let grass grow And think it but a minute spent in sport QUEEN MARGARET O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand That I may dew it with my mournful tears Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place To wash away my woeful monuments O could this kiss be printed in thy hand That thou mightst think upon these by the seal Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee So get thee gone that I may know my grief Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by As one that surfeits thinking on a want I will repeal thee or be well assured Adventure to be banished myself And banished I am if but from thee Go speak not to me even now be gone O go not yet Even thus two friends condemned Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves Loather a hundred times to part than die Yet now farewell and farewell life with thee SUFFOLK Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished Once by the King and three times thrice by thee Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence A wilderness is populous enough So Suffolk had thy heavenly company For where thou art there is the world itself With every several pleasure in the world And where thou art not desolation I can no more Live thou to joy thy life Myself no joy in nought but that thou livst Enter Vaux QUEEN MARGARET Whither goes Vaux so fast What news I prithee VAUX To signify unto his majesty That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death For suddenly a grievous sickness took him That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphreys ghost Were by his side sometime he calls the King And whispers to his pillow as to him The secrets of his overcharged soul And I am sent to tell his majesty That even now he cries aloud for him QUEEN MARGARET Go tell this heavy message to the King Exit Vaux Ay me What is this world What news are these But wherefore grieve I at an hours poor loss Omitting Suffolks exile my souls treasure Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee And with the southern clouds contend in tears Theirs for the earths increase mine for my sorrows Now get thee hence The King thou knowst is coming If thou be found by me thou art but dead SUFFOLK If I depart from thee I cannot live And in thy sight to die what were it else But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap Here could I breathe my soul into the air As mild and gentle as the cradlebabe Dying with mothers dug between its lips Where from thy sight I should be raging mad And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul Or I should breathe it so into thy body And then it lived in sweet Elysium To die by thee were but to die in jest From thee to die were torture more than death O let me stay befall what may befall QUEEN MARGARET Away Though parting be a fretful corrosive It is applied to a deathful wound To France sweet Suffolk Let me hear from thee For wheresoer thou art in this worlds globe Ill have an Iris that shall find thee out SUFFOLK I go QUEEN MARGARET And take my heart with thee SUFFOLK A jewel locked into the woefullst cask That ever did contain a thing of worth Even as a splitted bark so sunder we This way fall I to death QUEEN MARGARET This way for me Exeunt severally SCENE III A Bedchamber Enter the King Salisbury and Warwick to the Cardinal in bed KING HENRY How fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign CARDINAL If thou best Death Ill give thee Englands treasure Enough to purchase such another island So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain KING HENRY Ah what a sign it is of evil life Where deaths approach is seen so terrible WARWICK Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee CARDINAL Bring me unto my trial when you will Died he not in his bed Where should he die Can I make men live wheer they will or no O torture me no more I will confess Alive again Then show me where he is Ill give a thousand pound to look upon him He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them Comb down his hair look look it stands upright Like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul Give me some drink and bid the apothecary Bring the strong poison that I bought of him KING HENRY O Thou eternal mover of the heavens Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch O beat away the busy meddling fiend That lays strong siege unto this wretchs soul And from his bosom purge this black despair WARWICK See how the pangs of death do make him grin SALISBURY Disturb him not let him pass peaceably KING HENRY Peace to his soul if Gods good pleasure be Lord Cardinal if thou thinkst on heavens bliss Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope He dies and makes no sign O God forgive him WARWICK So bad a death argues a monstrous life KING HENRY Forbear to judge for we are sinners all Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close And let us all to meditation Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I The Coast of Kent Alarum Fight at sea Ordnance goes off Enter a Lieutenant Suffolk disguised a prisoner The Master a Masters Mate Walter Whitmore and prisoners LIEUTENANT The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day Is crept into the bosom of the sea And now loudhowling wolves arouse the jades That drag the tragic melancholy night Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings Clip dead mens graves and from their misty jaws Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs Here shall they make their ransom on the sand Or with their blood stain this discoloured shore Master this prisoner freely give I thee And thou that art his mate make boot of this The other Walter Whitmore is thy share 1 GENTLEMAN What is my ransom master Let me know MASTER A thousand crowns or else lay down your head MATE And so much shall you give or off goes yours LIEUTENANT What think you much to pay two thousand crowns And bear the name and port of gentlemen Cut both the villains throatsfor die you shall The lives of those which we have lost in fight Be counterpoised with such a petty sum 1 GENTLEMAN Ill give it sir and therefore spare my life 2 GENTLEMAN And so will I and write home for it straight WHITMORE To Suffolk I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die And so should these if I might have my will LIEUTENANT Be not so rash take ransom let him live SUFFOLK Look on my George I am a gentleman Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid WHITMORE And so am I my name is Walter Whitmore How now Why starts thou What doth death affright SUFFOLK Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death A cunning man did calculate my birth And told me that by water I should die Yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded Thy name is Gaultier being rightly sounded WHITMORE Gaultier or Walter which it is I care not Never yet did base dishonour blur our name But with our sword we wiped away the blot Therefore when merchantlike I sell revenge Broke be my sword my arms torn and defaced And I proclaimed a coward through the world SUFFOLK Stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole WHITMORE The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags SUFFOLK Ay but these rags are no part of the Duke Jove sometime went disguised and why not I LIEUTENANT But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be SUFFOLK Obscure and lowly swain King Henrys blood The honourable blood of Lancaster Must not be shed by such a jaded groomHast thou not kissed thy hand and held my stirrup Bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule And thought thee happy when I shook my head How often hast thou waited at my cup Fed from my trencher kneeled down at the board When I have feasted with Queen Margaret Remember it and let it make thee crestfallen Ay and allay thus thy abortive pride How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood And duly waited for my coming forth This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue WHITMORE Speak captain shall I stab the forlorn swain LIEUTENANT First let my words stab him as he hath me SUFFOLK Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou

And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphreys death Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again And wedded be thou to the hags of hell For daring to affy a mighty lord Unto the daughter of a worthless king Having neither subject wealth nor diadem By devilish policy art thou grown great And like ambitious Sylla overgorged With gobbets of thy mothers bleeding heart By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France The false revolting Normans thorough thee Disdain to call us lord and Picardy Hath slain their governors surprised our forts And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home The princely Warwick and the Nevilles all Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain As hating thee are rising up in arms And now the house of York thrust from the crown By shameful murder of a guiltless king And lofty proud encroaching tyranny Burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours Advance our halffaced sun striving to shine Under the which is writ Invitis nubibus The commons here in Kent are up in arms And to conclude reproach and beggary Is crept into the palace of our King And all by theeAway Convey him hence SUFFOLK O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder Upon these paltry servile abject drudges Small things make base men proud This villain here Being captain of a pinnace threatens more Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate Drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives It is impossible that I should die By such a lowly vassal as thyself Thy words move rage and not remorse in me I go of message from the Queen to France I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel LIEUTENANT Walter WHITMORE Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death SUFFOLK Pene gelidus timor occupat artus It is thee I fear WHITMORE Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee What are ye daunted now Now will ye stoop 1 GENTLEMAN My gracious lord entreat him speak him fair SUFFOLK Suffolks imperial tongue is stern and rough Used to command untaught to plead for favour Far be it we should honour such as these With humble suit No rather let my head Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any Save to the God of heaven and to my King And sooner dance upon a bloody pole Than stand uncovered to the vulgar groom True nobility is exempt from fear More can I bear than you dare execute LIEUTENANT Hale him away and let him talk no more SUFFOLK Come soldiers show what cruelty ye can That this my death may never be forgot Great men oft die by vile Bezonians A Roman sworder and banditto slave Murdered sweet Tully Brutus bastard hand Stabbed Julius Caesar savage islanders Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk LIEUTENANT And as for these whose ransom we have set It is our pleasure one

friend and will rid his foe Exeunt SCENE V Pomfret The dungeon of the Castle Enter Richard RICHARD I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I cannot do it Yet Ill hammer it out My brain Ill prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of stillbreeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermixed With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word as thus Come little ones And then again It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a needles eye Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortunes slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I kinged again and by and by Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing But whateer I be Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased With being nothing Music do I hear Music Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept So is it in the music of mens lives And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disordered string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numbring clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dials point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For tis a sign of

disdained the ground RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he not stumble Would he not

Soldiers c SCENE England ACT I SCENE I London A street Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester alone RICHARD Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths Our bruised arms hung up for monuments Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings Our dreadful marches to delightful measures Grimvisaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front And now instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass I that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph I that am curtailed of this fair proportion Cheated of feature by dissembling nature Deformed unfinished sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them Why I in this weak piping time of peace Have no delight to pass away the time Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity And therefore since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair wellspoken days I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days Plots have I laid inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle false and treacherous This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that G Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes Enter Clarence guarded and Brakenbury Brother good day What means this armed guard That waits upon your Grace CLARENCE His Majesty Tendring my persons safety hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower RICHARD Upon what cause CLARENCE Because my name is George RICHARD Alack my lord that fault is none of yours He should for that commit your godfathers O belike his Majesty hath some intent That you should be newchristened in the Tower But whats the matter Clarence May I know CLARENCE Yea Richard when I know for I protest As yet I do not But as I can learn He hearkens after prophecies and dreams And from the crossrow plucks the letter G And says a wizard told him that by G His issue disinherited should be And for my name of George begins with G It follows in his thought that I am he These as I learn and such like toys as these Hath moved his Highness to commit me now RICHARD Why this it is when men are ruled by women Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower My Lady Grey his wife Clarence tis she That tempers him to this extremity Was it not she and that good man of worship Antony Woodville her brother there That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower From whence this present day he is delivered We are not safe Clarence we are not safe CLARENCE By heaven I think there is no man secure But the Queens kindred and nightwalking heralds That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore Heard you not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery RICHARD Humbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty Ill tell you what I think it is our way If we will keep in favour with the King To be her men and wear her livery The jealous oerworn widow and herself Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen Are mighty gossips in our monarchy BRAKENBURY I beseech your Graces both to pardon me His Majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference Of what degree soever with your brother RICHARD Even so an please your worship Brakenbury You may partake of anything we say We speak no treason man We say the King Is wise and virtuous and his noble Queen Well struck in years fair and not jealous We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue And that the Queens kindred are made gentlefolks How say you sir Can you deny all this BRAKENBURY With this my lord myself have naught to do RICHARD Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee fellow He that doth naught with her excepting one Were best to do it secretly alone BRAKENBURY What one my lord RICHARD Her husband knave Wouldst thou betray me BRAKENBURY I do beseech your Grace to pardon me and withal Forbear your conference with the noble Duke CLARENCE We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey RICHARD We are the Queens abjects and must obey Brother farewell I will unto the KingAnd whatsoeer you will employ me in Were it to call King Edwards widow sister I will perform it to enfranchise you Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagine CLARENCE I know it pleaseth neither of us well RICHARD Well your imprisonment shall not be long I will deliver or else lie for you Meantime have patience CLARENCE I must perforce Farewell Exeunt Clarence Brakenbury and guard RICHARD Go tread the path that thou shalt neer return Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven If heaven will take the present at our hands But who comes here The newdelivered Hastings Enter Lord Hastings HASTINGS Good time of day unto my gracious lord RICHARD As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain Well are you welcome to the open air How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment HASTINGS With patience noble lord as prisoners must But I shall live my lord to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonment RICHARD No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too For they that were your enemies are his And have prevailed as much on him as you HASTINGS More pity that the eagles should be mewed Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty RICHARD What news abroad HASTINGS No news so bad abroad as this at home The King is sickly weak and melancholy And his physicians fear him mightily RICHARD Now by Saint John that news is bad indeed O he hath kept an evil diet long And overmuch consumed his royal person Tis very grievous to be thought upon Where is he in his bed HASTINGS He is RICHARD Go you before and I will follow you Exit Hastings He cannot live I hope and must not die Till George be packed with posthorse up to heaven Ill in to urge his hatred more to Clarence With lies well steeled with weighty arguments And if I fail not in my deep intent Clarence hath not another day to live Which done God take King Edward to his mercy And leave the world for me to bustle in For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter What though I killed her husband and her father The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father The which will I not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto But yet I run before my horse to market Clarence still

poor Anne Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughtered son Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds Lo in these windows that let forth thy life I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes O cursed be the hand that made these holes Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence More direful hap betide that hated wretch That makes us wretched by the death of thee Than I can wish to adders spiders toads Or any creeping venomed thing that lives If ever he have child abortive be it Prodigious and untimely brought to light Whose ugly and unnatural aspect May fright the hopeful mother at the view And that be heir to his unhappiness If ever he have wife let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my young lord and thee

mortal eyes cannot endure the devil Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell Thou hadst but power over his mortal body His soul thou canst not have therefore begone RICHARD Sweet saint for charity be not

Behold this pattern of thy butcheries O gentlemen see see dead Henrys wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity For tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural Provokes this deluge most unnatural O God which this blood madst revenge his death O earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick As thou dost swallow up this good Kings blood Which his hellgoverned arm hath butchered RICHARD Lady you know no rules of charity Which renders good for bad blessings for curses ANNE Villain thou knowst nor law of God nor man No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity RICHARD But I know none and therefore am no beast ANNE O wonderful when devils tell the truth RICHARD More wonderful when angels are so angry Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman Of these supposed crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself ANNE Vouchsafe diffused infection of a man Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self RICHARD Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself ANNE Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself RICHARD By such despair I should accuse myself ANNE And by despairing shalt thou stand excused For doing worthy vengeance on thyself That didst unworthy slaughter upon others RICHARD Say that I slew them not ANNE Then say they were not slain But dead they are and devilish slave by thee RICHARD I did not kill your husband ANNE Why then he is alive RICHARD Nay he is dead and slain by Edwards hand ANNE In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw Thy murdrous falchion smoking in his blood The which thou once didst bend against her breast But that thy brothers beat aside the point RICHARD I was provoked by her slandrous tongue That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders ANNE Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind That never dreamst on aught but butcheries Didst thou not kill this King RICHARD I grant ye ANNE Dost grant me hedgehog Then God grant me too Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed O he was gentle mild and virtuous RICHARD The better for the King of Heaven that hath him ANNE He is in heaven where thou shalt never come RICHARD Let him thank me that holp to send him thither For he was fitter for that place than earth ANNE And thou unfit for any place but hell RICHARD Yes one place else if you will hear me name it ANNE Some dungeon RICHARD Your bedchamber ANNE Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest RICHARD So will it madam till I lie with you ANNE I hope so RICHARD I know so But gentle Lady Anne To leave this keen encounter of our wits And fall something into a slower method Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward As blameful as the executioner ANNE Thou wast the cause and most accursed effect RICHARD Your beauty was the cause of that effect Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom ANNE If I thought that I tell thee homicide These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks RICHARD These eyes could not endure that beautys wrack You should not blemish it if I stood by As all the world is cheered by the sun So I by that it is my day my life ANNE Black night oershade thy day and death thy life RICHARD Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both ANNE I would I were to be revenged on thee RICHARD It is a quarrel most unnatural To be revenged on him that loveth thee ANNE It is a quarrel just and reasonable To be revenged on him that killed my husband RICHARD He that bereft thee lady of thy husband Did it to help thee to a better husband ANNE His better doth not breathe upon the earth RICHARD He lives that loves thee better than he could ANNE Name him RICHARD Plantagenet ANNE Why that was he RICHARD The selfsame name but one of better nature ANNE Where is he RICHARD Here She spits at him Why dost thou spit at me ANNE Would it were mortal poison for thy sake RICHARD Never came poison from so sweet a place ANNE Never hung poison on a fouler toad Out of my sight Thou dost infect mine eyes RICHARD Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine ANNE Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead RICHARD I would they were that I might die at once For now they kill me with a living death Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears Shamed their aspects with store of childish drops These eyes which never shed remorseful tear No when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When blackfaced Clifford shook his sword at him Nor when thy warlike father like a child Told the sad story of my fathers death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep That all the standersby had wet their cheeks Like trees bedashed with rain In that sad time My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping I never sued to friend nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word But now thy beauty is proposed my fee My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak She looks scornfully at him Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made For kissing lady not for such contempt If thy revengeful heart cannot forgiveLo here I lend thee this sharppointed sword Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee He kneels and lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry But twas thy beauty that provoked me Nay now dispatch twas I that stabbed young Edward But twas thy heavenly face that set me on She falls the sword Take up the sword again or take up me ANNE Arise dissembler Though I wish thy death I will not be thy executioner RICHARD Then bid me kill myself and I will do it ANNE I have already RICHARD That was in thy rage Speak it again and even with the word This hand which for thy love did kill thy love Shall for thy love kill a far truer love To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary ANNE I would I knew thy heart RICHARD Tis figured in my tongue ANNE I fear me both are false RICHARD Then never was man true ANNE Well well put up your sword RICHARD Say then my peace is made ANNE That shalt thou know hereafter RICHARD But shall I live in hope ANNE All men I hope live so RICHARD Vouchsafe to wear this ring ANNE To take is not to give He places the ring on her hand RICHARD Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart Wear both of them for both of them are thine And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favour at thy gracious hand Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever ANNE What is it RICHARD That it may please you leave these sad designs To him that hath most cause to be a mourner And presently repair to Crosby Place Where after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monastery this noble King And wet his grave with my repentant tears I will with all expedient duty see you For divers unknown reasons I beseech you Grant me this

months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewksbury A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman Framed in the prodigality of nature Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal The spacious world cannot again afford And will she yet abase her eyes on me That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed On me whose all not equals Edwards moiety On me that halt and am

where I hear he makes abode And for the ways are dangerous to pass I do desire thy worthy company Upon whose faith and honour I repose Urge not my fathers anger Eglamour But think upon my grief a

with his dog Crab LANCE When a mans servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard one that I brought up of a puppy one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it I have taught him even as one would say precisely Thus I would teach a dog I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master and I came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg O tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hanged fort sure as I live he had suffered fort You shall judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Dukes table he had not been therebless the marka pissingwhile but all the chamber smelt him Out with the dog says one What cur is that says another Whip him out says the third Hang him up says the Duke I having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs Friend quoth I you mean to whip the dog Ay marry do I quoth he You do him the more wrong quoth I Twas I did the thing you wot of He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber How many masters would do this for his servant Nay Ill be sworn I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had been executed I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed otherwise he had suffered fort To Crab Thou thinkst not of this now Nay I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia Did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewomans farthingale Didst thou ever see me do such a trick Enter Proteus and Julia disguised as Sebastian PROTEUS Sebastian is thy name

was stolen from me by the hangmans boys in the marketplace and then I offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift the greater PROTEUS Go get thee hence and find my dog again Or neer return again into my sight Away I say Stayest thou to vex me here A slave that still an end turns me to shame Exit Lance with Crab Sebastian I have entertained thee Partly that I have need of such a youth That can with some discretion do my business For tis no trusting to yond foolish lout But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour Which if my augury deceive me not Witness

seems you loved not her to leave her token Shes dead belike PROTEUS Not so I think she lives JULIA Alas PROTEUS Why dost thou cry Alas JULIA I cannot choose But pity her PROTEUS Wherefore shouldst thou pity her JULIA Because methinks that she loved you as well As you do love your lady Silvia She dreams on him that has forgot her love You dote on her that cares not for your love Tis pity love should be so contrary And thinking on it makes me cry Alas PROTEUS Well give her that ring and therewithal This letter Thats her chamber Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture Your message done hie home unto my chamber Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary Exit JULIA How many women would do such a message Alas poor Proteus thou hast entertained A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs Alas poor fool why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me Because he loves her he despiseth me Because I love him I must pity him This ring I gave him when he parted from me To bind him to remember my good will And now am I unhappy messenger To plead for that which I would not obtain To carry that which I would have refused To praise his faith which I would have dispraised I am my masters true confirmed love But cannot be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to myself Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly As heaven it knows I would not have him speed Enter Silvia attended Gentlewoman good day I pray you be my mean To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia SILVIA What would you with her if that I be she JULIA If you be she I do entreat your

look on that again JULIA It may not be Good madam pardon me SILVIA There hold I will not look upon your masters lines I know they are stuffed with protestations And full of newfound oaths which he will break As easily as I do tear his paper She tears the second letter JULIA Madam he sends your ladyship this ring SILVIA The more shame for him that he sends it me For I have heard him say a thousand times His Julia gave it him at his departure Though his false finger have profaned the ring Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong JULIA She thanks you SILVIA What sayst thou JULIA I thank

hundred several times SILVIA Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her JULIA I think she doth and thats her cause of sorrow SILVIA Is she not passing fairJULIA She hath been fairer madam than she is When she did think my master loved her well She in my judgement was as fair as you But since she did neglect her lookingglass And threw her sunexpelling mask away The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks And pinched the lilytincture of her face That now she is become as black as I SILVIA How tall was she JULIA About my stature for at Pentecost When all our pageants of delight were played Our youth got me to play the womans part And I was trimmed in Madam Julias gown Which served me as fit by all mens judgements As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height And at that time I made her weep agood For I did play a lamentable part Madam twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress moved therewithal Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow SILVIA She is beholding to thee gentle youth Alas poor lady desolate and left I weep myself to think upon thy words Here youth there is my purse I give thee this For thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovst her Farewell JULIA And she shall thank you fort if eer you know her Exeunt Silvia and Attendants A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful I hope my masters suit will be but cold Since she respects my mistress love so much Alas how love can trifle with itself Here is her picture let me see I think If I had such a tire this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flattered her a little Unless I flatter with myself too much Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love Ill get me such a coloured periwig Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine Ay but her foreheads low and mines as high What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come shadow come and take this shadow up For tis thy rival O thou senseless form Thou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored And were there sense in his idolatry My substance should be statue in thy stead Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake That used me so or else by Jove I vow I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee Exit ACT V SCENE I Milan An abbey Enter Eglamour EGLAMOUR The sun begins to gild the western sky And now it is

How now Thurio Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late THURIO Not I PROTEUS Nor I DUKE Saw you my daughter PROTEUS Neither DUKE Why then shes fled unto that peasant Valentine And Eglamour is in her company Tis true for Friar Lawrence met them both As he in penance wandered through the forest Him he knew well and guessed that it was she But being masked he was not sure of it Besides she did intend confession At Patricks cell this even and there she was not These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse But mount you presently and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads toward Mantua whither they are fled Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me Exit THURIO Why this it is to be a peevish girl That flies her fortune when it follows her Ill after more to be revenged on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Silvia Exit PROTEUS And I will follow more for Silvias love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her Exit JULIA And I will follow more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love Exit SCENE III Frontiers of Mantua The forest Enter Silvia and Outlaws FIRST OUTLAW Come come be patient We must

this I endure for thee Exeunt SCENE IV Another part of the forest Enter Valentine VALENTINE How use doth breed a habit in a man This shadowy desert unfrequented woods I better brook than flourishing peopled towns Here can I sit alone unseen of any And to the nightingales complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes O thou that dost inhabit in my breast Leave not the mansion so long tenantless Lest growing ruinous the building fall And leave no memory of what it was Repair me with thy presence Silvia Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain Shouts within What hallowing and

VALENTINE Aside How like a dream is this I see and hear Love lend me patience to forbear awhile SILVIA O miserable unhappy that I am PROTEUS Unhappy were you madam ere I came But by my coming I have

Proteus Therefore be gone solicit me no more PROTEUS What dangerous action stood it next to death Would I not undergo for one calm look O tis the curse in love and still approved When women cannot love where theyre beloved SILVIA When Proteus cannot love where hes beloved Read over Julias heart thy first best love For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths Descended into perjury to love me Thou hast no faith left now unless thoudst two And thats far worse than none better have none Than plural faith which is too much by one Thou counterfeit

friend of an ill fashion PROTEUS Valentine VALENTINE Thou common friend thats without faith or love For such is a friend now Treacherous man Thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me Who should be trusted when ones right hand Is perjured to the bosom Proteus I am sorry I must never trust thee more But

habit make thee blush Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment if shame live In a disguise of love It is the lesser blot modesty finds Women to change their shapes than men their minds PROTEUS Than men their minds Tis true O heaven were man But constant he were perfect That one error Fills him with faults makes him run through all th sins Inconstancy falls off ere it begins What is in Silvias face but I may spy More fresh in Julias with a constant eye VALENTINE Come come a hand from either Let me be blest to make this happy close Twere pity two such friends should

officer away Exeunt SCENE III A monastery Enter Duke and Friar Thomas DUKE No holy father throw away that thought Believe not that the dribbling dart of love Can pierce a complete bosom Why I desire thee To give me secret harbour hath a purpose More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends Of burning youth FRIAR THOMAS May your Grace speak of it DUKE My holy sir none better knows than you How I have ever loved the life removed And held in idle price to haunt assemblies Where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps I have delivered to Lord Angelo A man of stricture and firm abstinence My absolute power and place here in Vienna And he supposes me travelled to Poland For so I have strewed it in the common ear And so it is received Now pious sir You will demand of me why I do this FRIAR THOMAS Gladly my lord DUKE We have strict statutes and most biting laws The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds Which for this fourteen years we have let slip Even like an oergrown lion in a cave That goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers Having bound up the threatning twigs of birch Only to stick it in their childrens sight For terror not to use in time the rod Becomes more mocked than feared so our decrees Dead to infliction to themselves are dead And liberty plucks justice by the nose The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart Goes all decorum FRIAR THOMAS It rested in your Grace To unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased And it in you more dreadful would have seemed Than in Lord Angelo DUKE I do fear too dreadful Sith twas my fault to give the people scope Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them For what I bid them do for we bid this be done When evil deeds have their permissive pass And not the punishment Therefore indeed my father I have on Angelo imposed the office Who may in th ambush of my name strike home And yet my nature never in the fight To do in slander And to behold his sway I will as twere a brother of your order Visit both prince and people Therefore I prithee Supply me with the habit and instruct me How I may formally in person bear Like a true friar Moe reasons for this action At our more leisure shall I render you Only this one Lord Angelo is precise Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses That his blood flows or that his appetite Is more to bread than stone Hence shall we see If power change purpose what our seemers be Exeunt SCENE IV A nunnery Enter Isabella and Francisca a Nun ISABELLA And have you nuns no farther privileges FRANCISCA Are not these large enough ISABELLA Yes truly I speak not as desiring

Gentle Isabella Turn you the key and know his business of him You may I may not you are yet unsworn When you have vowed you must not speak with men But in the presence of the prioress Then if you

in prison ISABELLA Woe me For what LUCIO For that which if myself might be his judge He should receive his punishment in thanks He hath got his friend with child ISABELLA Sir make me not your story LUCIO Tis true I would not though tis my familiar sin With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest Tongue far from heart play with all virgins so I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted By your renouncement an immortal spirit And to be talked with in sincerity As with a saint ISABELLA You do blaspheme the good in mocking me LUCIO Do not believe it Fewness and truth tis thus Your brother and

husbandry ISABELLA Someone with child by him My cousin Juliet LUCIO Is she your cousin ISABELLA Adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names By vain though apt affection LUCIO She it is ISABELLA O let him marry her LUCIO This is the point The Duke is very strangely gone from hence Bore many gentlemen myself being one In hand and hope of action but we do learn By those that know the very nerves of state His givingsout were of an infinite distance From his truemeant design Upon his place And with full line of his authority Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood Is very snowbroth one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind study and fast He to give fear to use and liberty Which have for long run by the hideous law As mice by lions hath picked out an act Under whose heavy sense your brothers life Falls into forfeit He arrests him on it And follows close the rigour of the statute To make him an example All hope is gone Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo And thats my pith of business Twixt you and your poor brother ISABELLA Doth he so Seek his life LUCIO Has censured him already And as I hear the Provost hath a warrant Fors execution ISABELLA Alas what poor abilitys in me To do him good LUCIO Assay the power you have ISABELLA My power Alas I doubt LUCIO Our doubts are traitors And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo And let him learn to know when maidens sue Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe them ISABELLA Ill see what I can do LUCIO But speedily ISABELLA I will about it straight No longer staying but to give the Mother

attained th effect of your own purpose Whether you had not sometime in your life Erred in this point which now you censure him And pulled the law upon you ANGELO Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus Another thing to fall I not deny The jury passing on the prisoners life May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try Whats open made to justice That justice seizes What knows

many had not dared to do that evil If the first that did th edict infringe Had answered for his deed Now tis awake Takes note of what is done and like a prophet Looks in a glass that shows what future evils Either now or by remissness new conceived And so in progress to be hatched and born Are now to have no successive degrees But where they live to end ISABELLA Yet show some pity ANGELO I show it most of all when I show justice For then I pity those I do not know Which a dismissed offence would after gall And do him right that answering one foul wrong Lives not to act another Be satisfied Your brother dies tomorrow be content ISABELLA So you must be the first that gives this sentence And he that suffers O it is excellent To have a giants strength but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant LUCIO Thats well said ISABELLA Could great men thunder As Jove himself does Jove would neer be quiet For every pelting petty officer Would use his heaven for thunder Nothing but thunder Merciful Heaven Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak Than the soft myrtle But man proud man Dressed in a little brief authority Most ignorant of what hes most assured His glassy essence like an angry apePlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As makes the angels weep who with our spleens Would all themselves laugh mortal LUCIO O to him to him wench He will relent Hes coming I perceive t PROVOST Pray heaven she win him ISABELLA We cannot weigh our brother with ourself Great men may jest with saints tis wit in them But in the less foul profanation LUCIO Thourt i th right girl more o that ISABELLA That in the captains but a choleric word Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy LUCIO Art advised o that More ont ANGELO Why do you put these sayings upon me ISABELLA Because authority though it err like others Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself That skins the vice o th top Go to your bosom Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know Thats like my brothers fault If it confess A natural guiltiness such as is his Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue Against my brothers life ANGELO She speaks and tis such sense That my sense breeds with it Going Fare you well ISABELLA Gentle my lord turn back ANGELO I will bethink me Come again tomorrow ISABELLA Hark how Ill bribe you Good my lord turn back ANGELO How Bribe me ISABELLA Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you LUCIO You had marred all else ISABELLA Not with fond shekels of the tested gold Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor As fancy values them but with true prayers That shall be up at heaven and enter there Ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate To nothing temporal ANGELO Well come to me tomorrow LUCIO Aside to Isabella Go to tis well away ISABELLA Heaven keep your honour safe ANGELO Aside Amen For I am that way going to temptation Where prayers cross ISABELLA At what hour tomorrow Shall I attend your lordship ANGELO At any time fore noon ISABELLA Save your honour Exeunt Isabella Lucio and Provost ANGELO From thee even from thy virtue Whats this Whats this Is this her fault or mine The tempter or the tempted who sins most ha Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I That lying by the violet in the sun Do as the carrion does not as the flower Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be That modesty may more betray our sense Than womans lightness Having waste ground enough Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary And pitch our evils there O fie fie fie What dost thou or what art thou Angelo Dost thou desire her foully for those things That make her good O let her brother live Thieves for their robbery have authority When judges steal themselves What do I love her That I desire to hear her speak again And feast upon her eyes What ist I dream on O cunning enemy that to catch a saint With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous Is that temptation that doth goad us on To sin in loving virtue Never could the strumpet With all her double vigour art and nature Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid Subdues me quite Ever till now When men were fond I smiled and wondered how Exit SCENE III A room in a prison Enter Duke disguised as a Friar and Provost DUKE Hail to you Provost so I think you are PROVOST I am the Provost Whats your will good friar DUKE Bound by my charity and my blessed order I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison Do me the common right To let me see them and to make me know The nature of their crimes that I may minister To them accordingly PROVOST I would do more than that if more were needful Enter Juliet Look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine Who falling in the flaws of her own youth Hath blistered her report She is with child And he that got it sentenced a young man More fit to do another such offence Than die for this DUKE When must he die PROVOST As I do think tomorrow To Juliet I have provided for you stay a while And you shall be conducted DUKE Repent you fair one of the sin you carry JULIET I do and bear the shame most patiently DUKE Ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience And try your penitence if it be sound Or hollowly put on JULIET Ill gladly learn DUKE Love you the man that wronged you JULIET Yes as I love the woman that wronged him DUKE So then it seems your most offenceful act Was mutually committed JULIET Mutually DUKE Then was your sin of heavier kind than his JULIET I do confess it and repent it father DUKE Tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent As that the sin hath brought you to this shame Which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it But as we stand in fear JULIET I do repent me as it is an evil And take the shame with joy DUKE There rest Your partner as I hear must die tomorrow And I am going with instruction to him Grace go with you Benedicite Exit JULIET Must die tomorrow O injurious love That respites me a life whose very comfort Is still a dying horror PROVOST Tis pity of him Exeunt SCENE IV A room in Angelos house Enter Angelo ANGELO When I would pray and think I think and pray To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue Anchors on Isabel Heaven in my mouth As if I did but only chew his name And in my heart the strong and swelling evil Of my conception The state whereon I studied Is like a good thing being often read Grown sere and tedious yea my gravity Whereinlet no man hear meI take pride Could I with boot change for an idle plume Which the air beats for vain O place O form How often dost thou with thy case thy habit Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls To thy false seeming Blood thou art blood Lets write good angel on the devils horn Tis not the devils crest Knock within How now whos there Enter Servant SERVANT One Isabel a sister desires access to you ANGELO Teach her the way Exit Servant O heavens Why does my blood thus muster to my heart Making both it unable for itself And dispossessing all my other parts Of necessary fitness So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons Come all to help him and so stop the air By which he should revive And even so The general subject to a wellwished king Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness Crowd to his presence where their untaught love Must needs appear offence Enter Isabella How now fair maid ISABELLA I am come to know your pleasure ANGELO That you might know it would much better please me Than to demand what tis Your brother cannot live ISABELLA Even so Heaven keep your honour ANGELO Yet may he live a while And it may be As long as you or I Yet he must die ISABELLA Under your sentence ANGELO Yea ISABELLA When I beseech you That in his reprieve Longer or shorter he may be so fitted That his soul sicken not ANGELO Ha Fie these filthy vices It were as good To pardon him that hath from nature stolen A man already made as to remit Their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image In stamps that are forbid Tis all as easy Falsely to take away a life true made As to put metal in restrained means To make a false one ISABELLA Tis set down so in heaven but not in earth ANGELO Say you so Then I shall pose you quickly Which had you rather that the most just law Now took your brothers life or to redeem him Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness As she that he hath stained ISABELLA Sir believe this I had rather give my body than my soul ANGELO I talk not of your soul Our compelled sins Stand more for number than for accompt ISABELLA How say you ANGELO Nay Ill not warrant that for I can speak Against the thing I say Answer to this I now the voice of the recorded law Pronounce a sentence on your brothers life Might there not be a charity in sin To save this brothers life ISABELLA Please you to dot Ill take it as a peril to my soul It is no sin at all but charity ANGELO Pleased you to dot at peril of your soul Were equal poise of sin and charity ISABELLA That I do beg his life if it be sin Heaven let me bear it You granting of my suit If that be sin Ill make it my morn prayer To have it added to the faults of mine And nothing of your answer ANGELO Nay but hear me Your sense pursues not mine Either you are ignorant Or seem so crafty and thats not good ISABELLA Let me be ignorant and in nothing good But graciously to know I am no better ANGELO Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright When it doth tax itself as these black masks Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder Than beauty could displayed But mark me To be received plain Ill speak more gross Your brother is to die ISABELLA So ANGELO And his offence is so as it appears Accountant to the law upon that pain ISABELLA True ANGELO Admit no other way to save his life As I subscribe not that nor any other But in the loss of question that you his sister Finding yourself desired of such a person Whose credit with the judge or own great place Could fetch your brother from the manacles Of the allbinding law and that there were No earthly mean to save him but that either You must lay down the treasures of your body To this supposed or else to let him suffer What would you do ISABELLA As much for my poor brother as myself That is were I under the terms of death Th impression of keen whips Id wear as rubies And strip myself to death as to a bed That longing have been sick for ere Id yield My body up to shame ANGELO Then must your brother die ISABELLA And twere the cheaper way Better it were a brother died at once Than that a sister by redeeming him Should die for ever ANGELO Were not you then as cruel as the sentence That you have slandered so ISABELLA Ignominy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses Lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption ANGELO You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant And rather proved the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice ISABELLA O pardon me my lord It oft falls out To have what we would have we speak not what we mean I something do excuse the thing I hate For his advantage that I dearly love ANGELO We are all frail ISABELLA Else let my brother die If not a feodary but only he Owe and succeed by weakness ANGELO Nay women are frail too ISABELLA Ay as the glasses where they view themselves Which are as easy broke as they make forms WomenHelp heaven Men their creation mar In profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail For we are soft as our complexions are And credulous to false prints ANGELO I think it well And from this testimony of your own sex Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger Than faults may shake our frames let me be boldI do arrest your words Be that you are That is a woman If you be more youre none If you be one as you are well expressed By all external warrants show it now By putting on the destined livery ISABELLA I have no tongue but one Gentle my lord Let me intreat you speak the former language ANGELO Plainly conceive I love you ISABELLA My brother did love Juliet And you tell me that he shall die for t ANGELO He shall not Isabel if you give me love ISABELLA I know your virtue hath a license int Which seems a little fouler than it is To pluck on others ANGELO Believe me on mine honour My words express my purpose ISABELLA Ha Little honour to be much believed And most pernicious purpose Seeming seeming I will proclaim thee Angelo look fort Sign me a present pardon for my brother Or with an outstretched throat Ill tell the world aloud What man thou art ANGELO Who will believe thee Isabel My unsoiled name th austereness of my life My vouch against you and my place i th state Will so your accusation overweigh That you shall stifle in your own report And smell of calumny I have begun And now I give my sensual race the rein Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes That banish what they sue for Redeem thy brother By yielding up thy body to my will Or else he must not only die the death But thy unkindness shall his death draw out To lingring sufferance Answer me tomorrow Or by the affection that now guides me most Ill prove a tyrant to him As for you Say what you can my false oerweighs your true Exit ISABELLA To whom should I complain Did I tell this Who would believe me O perilous mouths That bear in them one and the selfsame tongue Either of condemnation or approof Bidding the law make curtsy to their will Hooking both right and wrong to th appetite To follow as it draws Ill to my brother Though he hath falln by prompture of the blood Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour That had he twenty heads to tender down On twenty bloody blocks hed yield them up Before his sister should her body stoop To such abhorred pollution Then Isabel live chaste and brother die More than our brother is our chastity Ill tell him yet of Angelos request And fit his mind to death for his souls rest Exit ACT III SCENE I A room in the prison Enter Duke Claudio and Provost DUKE So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo CLAUDIO The miserable have no other medicine But only hope I have hope to live and am prepared to die DUKE Be absolute for death Either death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life If I do lose thee I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep A breath thou art Servile to all the skyey influences That dost this habitation where thou keepst Hourly afflict Merely thou art deaths fool For him thou labourst by thy flight to shun And yet runnst toward him still Thou art not noble For all th accommodations that thou bearst Are nursed"

face of mine And made no deeper wounds O flattring glass Like to my followers in prosperity Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face That every day under his household roof Did keep ten thousand men Was this the face That like the sun did make beholders wink Is this the face which faced so many follies That was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke A brittle glory shineth in this face As brittle as

stand Thou map of honour thou King Richards tomb And not King Richard Thou most beauteous inn Why should hardfavoured grief be lodged in thee When triumph is become an alehouse guest KING RICHARD Join not with grief fair woman do not so To make my end too sudden Learn good soulTo think our former state a happy dream From which awaked the truth of what we are Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet To grim Necessity and he and I Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France And cloister thee in some religious house Our holy lives must win a new worlds crown Which our profane hours here have thrown down QUEEN What is my Richard both in shape and mind Transformed and weakened Hath Bolingbroke Deposed thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage To be oerpowered and wilt thou pupillike Take the correction mildly kiss the rod And fawn on rage with base humility Which art a lion and the king of beasts

my deathbed thy last living leave In winters tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid And ere thou bid good night to quit their

My Lord you told me you would tell the rest When weeping made you break the story off Of our two cousins coming into London YORK Where did I leave DUCHESS At that sad stop my lord Where rude misgoverned hands from windows tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head YORK Then as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed Which his aspiring rider seemed to know With slow but stately pace kept on his course Whilst all tongues cried God save thee Bolingbroke You would have thought the very windows spake So many greedy looks of young and old Through casements darted their desiring eyes Upon his visage and that all the walls With painted imagery had said at once Jesu preserve thee Welcome Bolingbroke Whilst he from the one side to the other turning Bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck Bespake them thus I thank you countrymen And thus still doing thus he passed along DUCHESS Alack poor Richard Where rode he the whilst YORK As in a theatre the eyes of men After a wellgraced actor leaves the stage Are idly bent on him that enters next Thinking his prattle to be tedious Even so or with much more contempt mens eyes Did scowl on gentle Richard No man cried God save him No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home But dust was thrown upon his sacred head Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off His face still combating with tears and smiles The badges of his grief and patience That had not God for some strong purpose steeled The hearts of men they must perforce have melted And barbarism itself have pitied him But heaven hath a hand in these events To whose high will we bound our calm contents To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now Whose state and honour I for aye allow Enter Aumerle DUCHESS Here comes my son Aumerle YORK Aumerle that was But that is lost for being Richards friend And madam you must call him Rutland now I am in Parliament pledge for his truth And lasting fealty to the newmade king DUCHESS Welcome my son Who are the violets now That strew the green lap of the newcome spring AUMERLE Madam I know not nor I greatly care not God knows I had as lief be none as one YORK Well bear you well in

mean to see I fear I fear DUCHESS What should you fear Tis nothing but some bond that he is entered into For gay apparel gainst the triumph day YORK Bound to himself What doth he with a bond That he is bound to Wife thou art a fool Boy let me see the writing AUMERLE I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it YORK I will be satisfied Let me see it I say Snatches it and reads it Treason foul

the trespass of thine own Have we more sons Or are we like to have Is not my teeming date drunk up with time And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age And rob me of a happy mothers name Is he not like thee Is he not thine own YORK Thou fond mad woman Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy A dozen of them here have taen the sacrament And interchangeably set down their hands To kill the King at Oxford DUCHESS He shall be none Well keep him here Then what is that to him YORK Away fond woman Were he twenty times my son I would appeach him DUCHESS Hadst thou groaned for him As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect That I have been disloyal to thy bed And that he is a bastard not thy son Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind He is as like thee as a man may be Not like to me or any of my kin And yet I love him YORK Make way unruly woman Exit DUCHESS After Aumerle Mount thee upon his horse Spur post and get before him to the King And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee Ill not be long behind Though I be old I doubt not but to ride as fast as York And never will I rise up from the ground Till Bolingbroke have pardoned thee Away be gone Exeunt SCENE III Windsor A room in the Castle Enter Bolingbroke as King Harry Percy and other Lords KING HENRY Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son Tis full three months since I did see him last If any plague hang over us tis he I would to God my lords he might be found Inquire at London mongst the taverns there For there they say he daily doth frequent With unrestrained loose companions Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes And beat our watch and rob our passengers While he young wanton and effeminate boy Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crew PERCY My lord some two days since I saw the Prince And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford KING HENRY And what said the gallant PERCY His answer was he would unto the stews And from the commonst creature pluck a glove And wear it as a favour and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger KING HENRY As dissolute as desperate Yet through both I see some sparks of better hope which elder years May happily bring forth But who comes here Enter Aumerle AUMERLE Where is the King KING HENRY What means our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly AUMERLE God save your Grace I do beseech your majesty To have some conference with your Grace alone KING HENRY Withdraw yourselves and leave us here aloneExeunt Harry Percy and Lords What is the matter with our cousin now AUMERLE Kneels For ever may my knees grow to the earth My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak KING HENRY Intended or committed was this fault If on the first how heinous eer it be To win thy afterlove I pardon thee AUMERLE Then give me leave that I may turn the key That no man enter till my tale be done KING HENRY Have thy desire Aumerle locks the door YORK Within My liege beware Look to thyself Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there KING HENRY Drawing Villain Ill make thee safe AUMERLE Stay thy revengeful hand Thou hast no cause to fear YORK Within Open the door secure foolhardy king Shall I for love speak treason to thy face Open the door or I will break it open King Henry unlocks the door and afterwards relocks it Enter York KING HENRY What is the matter uncle Speak Recover breath Tell us how near is danger That we may arm us to encounter it YORK Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show AUMERLE Remember as thou readst thy promise passed I do repent me Read not my name there My heart is not confederate with my hand YORK It was villain ere thy hand did set it down I tore it from the traitors bosom king Fear and not love begets his penitence Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart KING HENRY O heinous strong and bold conspiracy O loyal father of a treacherous son Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain From whence this stream through muddy passages Hath held his current and defiled himself Thy overflow of good converts to bad And thy abundant goodness shall excuse This deadly blot in thy digressing son YORK So shall my virtue be his vices bawd And he shall spend mine honour with his shame As thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies Thou killst me in his life giving him breath The traitor lives the true mans put to death DUCHESS Within What ho my liege For Gods sake let me in KING HENRY What shrillvoiced suppliant makes this eager cry DUCHESS Within A woman and thine aunt great king tis I Speak with me pity me open the door A beggar begs that never begged before

earnest Look upon his face His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest His words come from his mouth ours from our breast He prays but faintly and would be denied We pray with heart and soul and all beside His weary joints would gladly rise I know Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow His prayers are full of false hypocrisy Ours of true zeal and deep integrity Our prayers do outpray his then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have KING HENRY Good aunt stand up DUCHESS Nay do not say stand up Say pardon first and afterwards stand up An if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach Pardon should be the first word of thy speech I never longed to hear a word till now Say pardon king let pity teach thee how The word is short but not so short as sweet No word like pardon for kings mouths so meet YORK Speak it in French King say pardonne moy DUCHESS Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy Ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord That sets the word itself against the word Speak pardon as tis current in our land The chopping French we do not understand Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce Pity may move thee pardon to rehearse KING HENRY Good aunt stand up DUCHESS I do not sue to stand Pardon is all the suit I have in hand KING HENRY I pardon him as God shall pardon me DUCHESS O happy vantage of a kneeling knee Yet am I sick for fear Speak it again Twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain But makes one pardon strong KING HENRY With all my heart I pardon him DUCHESS A god on earth thou art KING HENRY But for our trusty brotherinlaw and the Abbot With all the rest of that consorted crew Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels Good uncle help to order several powers To Oxford or whereer these traitors are They shall not live within this world I swear But I will have them if I once know where Uncle farewell and cousin adieu Your mother well hath prayed and prove you true DUCHESS Come my old son I pray God make thee new Exeunt SCENE IV Another room in the Castle Enter Exton and a Servant EXTON Didst thou not mark the King what words he spake Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear Was it not so SERVANT These were his very words EXTON Have I no friend quoth he He spake it twice And urged it twice together did he not SERVANT He did EXTON And speaking it he wishtly looked on me As who should say I would thou wert the man That would divorce this terror from my heart Meaning the king at Pomfret Come lets go I am the Kings friend and will rid his foe Exeunt SCENE V Pomfret The dungeon of the Castle Enter Richard RICHARD I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I cannot do it Yet Ill hammer it out My brain Ill prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of stillbreeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermixed With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word as thus Come little ones And then again It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a needles eye Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortunes slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I kinged again and by and by Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing But whateer I be Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased With being nothing Music do I hear Music Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept So is it in the music of mens lives And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disordered string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numbring clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dials point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this allhating world Enter a Groom of the stable GROOM Hail royal Prince RICHARD Thanks noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear What art thou and how comest thou hither Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live GROOM I was a poor groom of thy stable king When thou wert king who travelling towards York With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal masters face O how it erned my heart when I beheld In London streets that coronation day When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary That horse that thou so often hast bestrid That horse that I so carefully have dressed RICHARD Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend How went he under him GROOM So proudly as if he disdained the ground RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he not stumble Would he not fall down Since pride must have a fall and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp his back Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee Since thou created to be awed by man Wast born to bear I was not made a horse And yet I bear a burden like an ass Spurred galled and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke Enter Keeper with a dish KEEPER To the Groom Fellow give place Here is no longer stay RICHARD If thou love me tis time thou wert away GROOM My tongue dares not that my heart shall say Exit KEEPER My lord willt please you to fall to RICHARD Taste of it first as thou art wont to do KEEPER My lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton Who lately came from the King commands the contraryRICHARD The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee Patience is stale and I am weary of it Strikes the Keeper KEEPER Help help help Enter Exton and Servants armed RICHARD How now What means death in this rude assault Villain thy own hand yields thy deaths instrument Snatching a weapon and killing one Go thou and fill

ladys chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass I that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty To strut

inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle

their liberty than ours be more LUCIANA Because their business still lies out o door ADRIANA Look when I serve him so he takes it ill LUCIANA O know he is the bridle of your will ADRIANA Theres none but asses will be bridled so LUCIANA Why headstrong liberty is lashd with woe Theres nothing situate under heavens eye But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky The beasts the fishes and the winged fowls Are their males subjects and at their controls Man more divine the masters of all these Lord of the wide world and wild watry seas Indued with intellectual sense and souls Of more preeminence than fish and fowls Are masters to their females and their lords Then let your will attend on their accords ADRIANA This servitude makes you to keep unwed LUCIANA Not this but troubles of the

would forbear ADRIANA Patience unmovd No marvel though she pause They can be meek that have no other cause A wretched soul bruisd with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry But were we burdned with like weight of pain As much or more we should ourselves complain So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee With urging helpless patience would relieve me But if thou live to see like right

Hath homely age th alluring beauty took From my poor cheek then he hath wasted it Are my discourses dull barren my wit If voluble and sharp discourse be marrd Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard Do their gay vestments his affections bait Thats not my fault hes master of my state What ruins are in me that can be found By him not ruind Then is he the ground Of my defeatures My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair But too unruly deer he breaks the pale And feeds from home poor I am but his stale LUCIANA Selfharming jealousy fie beat it hence ADRIANA Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense I know his eye doth homage otherwhere Or else what lets it but he would be here Sister you know he promisd me a chain Would that alone a love he would detain So he would keep fair quarter with his bed I see the jewel best enamelled Will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still That others touch yet often touching will Wear gold and no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame Since that my beauty cannot please his eye Ill weep whats left away and weeping die LUCIANA How many fond fools serve mad jealousy Exeunt SCENE II The same Enter Antipholus of

lust should be contaminate Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me And hurl the name of husband in my face And tear the staind skin off my harlot brow And from my false hand cut the weddingring And break it with a deepdivorcing vow I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it I am possessd with an adulterate blot My blood is mingled with the crime of lust For if we two be one and thou play

better confirmation For all the soil of the achievement goes With me into the earth It seemd in me But as an honour snatchd with boisterous hand And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed Wounding supposed peace All these bold fears Thou seest with peril I have answered For all my reign hath been but as a scene Acting that

of judgement Whereon as an offender to your father I gave bold way to my authority And did commit you If the deed were ill Be you contented wearing now the garland To have a son set your decrees at nought To pluck down justice from your awful bench To trip the course of law and blunt the sword That guards the peace and safety of your person Nay more to spurn at your most royal image And mock

have to say is of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I doubt prove mine own marring But to the purpose and so to the venture Be it known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better I meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle creditors lose Here I promised you I would be and here I commit my body to your mercies Bate me some and I will pay you some and as most debtors do promise you infinitely If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to use my legs And yet that were but light payment to dance out of your debt But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction and so would I All the

On your imaginary forces work Suppose within the girdle of these walls Are now confind two mighty monarchies Whose high upreared and abutting fronts The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder Piece out

history Who prologuelike your humble patience pray Gently to hear kindly to judge our play Exit ACT I SCENE I London An antechamber in the Kings palace Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely CANTERBURY My lord Ill tell you that self bill is urgd Which in the eleventh year of the last kings reign Was like and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question ELY But how my lord shall we resist it now CANTERBURY It must be thought on If it pass against us We lose the better half of our possession For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us being valud thus As much as would maintain to the Kings honour Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights Six thousand and two hundred good esquires And to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil A hundred almshouses right well supplied And to the coffers of the King beside A thousand pounds by th year Thus runs the bill ELY This would drink deep CANTERBURY Twould drink the cup and all ELY But what prevention CANTERBURY The King is full of grace and fair regard ELY And a true lover of the holy Church CANTERBURY The courses of his youth promisd it not The breath no sooner left his fathers body But that his wildness mortified in him Seemed to die too yea at that very moment Consideration like an angel came And whipped th offending Adam out of him Leaving his body as a paradise T envelope and contain celestial spirits Never was such a sudden scholar made Never came reformation in a flood With such a heady currance scouring faults Nor never Hydraheaded wilfulness So soon did lose his seat and all at once As in this king ELY We are blessed in the change CANTERBURY Hear him but reason in divinity And alladmiring with an inward wish You would desire the King were made a prelate Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs You would say it hath been all in all his study List his discourse of war and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music Turn him to any cause of policy The Gordian knot of it he will unloose Familiar as his garter that when he speaks The air a chartered libertine is still And the mute wonder lurketh in mens ears To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences So that the art and practic part of life Must be the mistress to this theoric Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it Since his addiction was to courses vain His companies unlettered rude and shallow His hours filled up with riots banquets sports And never noted in him any study Any retirement any sequestration From open haunts and popularity ELY The strawberry grows underneath the nettle And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best Neighboured by fruit of baser quality And so the Prince obscured his contemplation Under the veil of wildness which no doubt Grew like the summer grass fastest by night Unseen yet crescive in his faculty CANTERBURY It must be so for miracles are ceased And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected ELY But my good lord How now for mitigation of this bill Urged by the Commons Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no CANTERBURY He seems indifferent Or rather swaying more upon our part Than cherishing th exhibitors against us For I have made an offer to his Majesty Upon our spiritual convocation And in regard of causes now in hand Which I have opened to his Grace at large As touching France to give a greater sum Than ever at one time the clergy yet Did to his predecessors part withal ELY How did this offer seem received my lord CANTERBURY With good acceptance of his Majesty Save that there was not time enough to hear As I perceived his Grace would fain have done The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms And generally to the crown and seat of France Derived from Edward his greatgrandfather ELY What was th impediment that broke this off CANTERBURY The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience and the hour I think is come To give him hearing Is it four oclock ELY It is CANTERBURY Then go we in to know his embassy Which I could with a ready guess declare Before the Frenchman speak a word of it ELY Ill wait upon you and I long to hear it Exeunt SCENE II The same The presence chamber Enter King Henry Gloucester Bedford Clarence Warwick Westmorland Exeter and Attendants KING HENRY Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury EXETER Not here in presence KING HENRY Send for him good uncle WESTMORLAND Shall we call in th ambassador my liege KING HENRY Not yet my cousin We would be resolved Before we hear him of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely CANTERBURY God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it KING HENRY Sure we thank you My learned lord we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim And God forbid my dear and faithful lord That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate whose right Suits not in native colours with the truth For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation Of what your reverence shall incite us to Therefore take heed how you impawn our person How you awake our sleeping sword of war We charge you in the name of God take heed For never two such kingdoms did contend Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops Are every one a woe a sore complaint Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords That makes such waste in brief mortality Under this conjuration speak my lord For we will hear note and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism CANTERBURY Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers That owe yourselves your lives and services To this imperial throne There is no bar To make against your Highness claim to France But this which they produce from Pharamond In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant No woman shall succeed in Salic land Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze To be the realm of France and Pharamond The founder of this law and female bar Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salic is in Germany Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe Where Charles the Great having subdud the Saxons There left behind and settled certain French Who holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life Establishd then this law to wit no female Should be inheritrix in Salic land Which Salic as I said twixt Elbe and Sala Is at this day in Germany calld Meissen Then doth it well appear the Salic law Was not devised for the realm of France Nor did the French possess the Salic land Until four hundred one and twenty years After defunction of King Pharamond Idly supposd the founder of this law Who died within the year of our redemption Four hundred twentysix and Charles the Great Subdud the Saxons and did seat the French Beyond the river Sala in the year Eight hundred five Besides their writers say King Pepin which deposed Childeric Did as heir general being descended Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair Make claim and title to the crown of France Hugh Capet also who usurpd the crown Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great To find his title with some shows of truth Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught Conveyd himself as the heir to the Lady Lingare Daughter to Charlemain who was the son To Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet Could not keep quiet in his conscience Wearing the crown of France till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of FranceSo that as clear as is the summers sun King Pepins title and Hugh Capets claim King Lewis his satisfaction all appear To hold in right and title of the female So do the kings of France unto this day Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurpd from you and your progenitors KING HENRY May I with right and conscience make this claim CANTERBURY The sin upon my head dread sovereign For in the Book of Numbers is it writ When the man dies let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord Stand for your own Unwind your bloody flag Look back into your mighty ancestors Go my dread lord to your"

that idiot laughter keep mens eyes And strain their cheeks to idle merriment A passion hateful to my purposes Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes Hear me without thine ears and make reply Without a tongue using conceit alone Without eyes ears and harmful sound of words Then in despite of brooded watchful day I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts But ah I will not Yet I love thee well

Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye On yon young boy Ill tell thee what my friend He is a very serpent in my way And wheresoeer this foot of mine doth tread He lies before me Dost thou understand me Thou art his keeper HUBERT And Ill keep him so That he shall not offend your majesty KING JOHN Death HUBERT My lord KING JOHN A grave HUBERT He shall not live KING JOHN Enough I could be merry now

tempest on the flood A whole armado of convicted sail Is scattered and disjoind from fellowship PANDULPH Courage and comfort All shall yet go well KING PHILIP What can go well when we have run so ill Are we not beaten Is not Angiers lost Arthur taen prisoner Divers dear friends slain And bloody England into England gone Oerbearing interruption spite of France LOUIS What he hath won that hath he fortified So hot a speed with such advice disposd Such temperate order in so fierce a cause Doth want example Who hath read or heard Of any kindred action like to this KING PHILIP Well could I bear that England had this praiseSo we could find some pattern of our shame Enter Constance Look who comes here A grave unto a soul Holding th eternal spirit against her will In the vile prison of afflicted breath I prithee lady go away with me CONSTANCE Lo now now see the issue of your peace KING PHILIP Patience good lady Comfort gentle Constance CONSTANCE No I defy all counsel all redress But that which ends all counsel true redress Death death O amiable lovely death Thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness Arise forth from the couch of lasting night Thou hate and terror to prosperity And I will kiss thy detestable bones And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows And ring these fingers with thy household worms And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust And be a carrion monster like thyself Come grin on me and I will think thou smilst And buss thee as thy wife Miserys love O come to me KING PHILIP O fair affliction peace CONSTANCE No no I will not having breath to cry O that my tongue were in the thunders mouth Then with a passion would I shake the world And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy Which cannot hear a ladys feeble voice Which scorns a modern invocation PANDULPH Lady you utter madness and not sorrow CONSTANCE Thou art not holy to belie me so I am not mad This hair I tear is mine My name is Constance I was Geoffreys wife Young Arthur is my son and he is lost I am not mad I would to heaven I were For then tis like I should forget myself O if I could what grief should I forget Preach some philosophy to make me mad And thou shalt be canonizd cardinal For being not mad but sensible of grief My reasonable part produces reason How I may be deliverd of these woes And teaches me to kill or hang myself If I were mad I should forget my son Or madly think a babe of clouts were he I am not mad too well too well I feel The different plague of each calamity KING PHILIP Bind up those tresses O what love I note In the fair multitude of those her hairs Where but by a chance a silver drop hath falln Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends Do glue themselves in sociable grief Like true inseparable faithful loves Sticking together in calamity CONSTANCE To England if you will KING PHILIP Bind up your hairs CONSTANCE Yes that I will and wherefore will I do it I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud O that these hands could so redeem my son As they have given these hairs their liberty But now I envy at their liberty And will again commit them to their bonds Because my poor child is a prisoner And father cardinal I have heard you say That we shall see and know our friends in heaven If that be true I shall see my boy again For since the birth of Cain the first male child To him that did but yesterday suspire There was not such a gracious creature born But now will canker sorrow eat my bud And chase the native beauty from his cheek And he will look as hollow as a ghost As dim and meagre as an agues fit And so hell die and rising so again When I

never had a son KING PHILIP You are as fond of grief as of your child CONSTANCE Grief fills the room up of my absent child Lies in his bed walks up and down with me Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words Remembers me of all his gracious parts Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form Then have I reason to be fond of grief Fare you well Had you such a loss as I I could give better comfort

ear of a drowsy man And bitter shame hath spoild the sweet worlds taste That it yields nought but shame and bitterness PANDULPH Before the curing of a strong disease Even in the instant of repair and health The fit is strongest evils that take leave On their departure most of all show evil What have you lost by losing of this day LOUIS All days of glory joy and happiness PANDULPH If you had won it certainly you had No no when Fortune means to men most good She looks upon them with a threatning eye Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost In this which he accounts so clearly won Are not you grievd that Arthur is his prisoner LOUIS As heartily as he is glad he hath him PANDULPH Your mind is all as youthful as your blood Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit For even the breath of what I mean to speak Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub Out of the path which shall directly lead Thy foot to Englands throne and therefore mark John hath seizd Arthur and it cannot be That whiles warm life plays in that infants veins The misplacd John should entertain an hour One minute nay one quiet breath of rest A sceptre snatchd with an unruly hand Must be boisterously maintaind as gaind And he that stands upon a slippry place Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall So be it for it cannot be but so LOUIS But what shall I gain by young Arthurs fall PANDULPH You in the right of Lady Blanche your wife May then make all the claim that Arthur did LOUIS And lose it life and all as Arthur did PANDULPH How green you are and fresh in this old world John lays you plots the times conspire with you For he that steeps his safety in true blood Shall find but bloody safety and untrue This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts Of all his people and freeze up their zeal That none so small advantage shall step forth To check his reign but they will cherish it No natural exhalation in the sky No scope of nature no distemperd day No common wind no customed event But they will pluck away his natural cause And call them meteors prodigies and signs Abortives presages and tongues of heaven Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John LOUIS Maybe he will not touch young Arthurs life But hold himself safe in his prisonment PANDULPH O sir when he shall hear of your approach If that young Arthur be not gone already Even at that news he dies and then the hearts Of all his people shall revolt from him And kiss the lips of unacquainted change And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath Out of the bloody fingers ends of John Methinks I see this hurly all on foot And O what better matter breeds for you Than I have namd The bastard Faulconbridge Is now in England ransacking the church Offending charity If but a dozen French Were there in arms they would be as a call To train ten thousand English to their side Or as a little snow tumbled about Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin Go with me to the King Tis wonderful What may be wrought out of their discontent Now that their souls are topful of offence For England go I will whet on the King LOUIS Strong reasons makes strong actions Let us go If you say

HUBERT Uncleanly scruples Fear not you look tot Exeunt Executioners Young lad come forth I have to say with you Enter Arthur ARTHUR Good morrow Hubert HUBERT Good morrow little prince ARTHUR As little prince having so great a title To be more prince as may be You are sad HUBERT Indeed I have been merrier ARTHUR Mercy on me Methinks nobody should be sad but I Yet I remember when I was in France Young gentlemen would be as sad as night Only for wantonness By my christendom So I were out of prison and kept sheep I should be as merry as the day is long And so I would be here but that I doubt My uncle practises more harm to me He is afraid of me and I of him Is it my fault that I was Geoffreys son No indeed ist not and I would to heaven I were your son so you would love me Hubert HUBERT Aside If I talk to him with his innocent prate He will awake my mercy which lies dead Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch ARTHUR Are you sick Hubert You look pale today In sooth I would you were a little sick That I might sit all night and watch with you I warrant I love you more than you do me HUBERT Aside His words do take possession of my bosom Read here young Arthur Showing a paper Aside How now foolish rheum Turning dispiteous torture out of door I must be brief lest resolution drop Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears Can you not read it Is it not fair writ ARTHUR Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes HUBERT Young boy I must ARTHUR And will you HUBERT And I will ARTHUR Have you the heart When your head did but ache I knit my handkercher about your brows The best I had a princess wrought it me And I did never ask it you again And with my hand at midnight held your head And like the watchful minutes to the hour Still and anon cheerd up the heavy time Saying What lack you and Where lies your grief Or What good love may I perform for you Many a poor mans son would have lien still And neer have spoke a loving word to you But you at your sick service had a prince Nay you may think my love was crafty love And call it cunning Do an if you will If heaven be pleasd that you must use me ill Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes These eyes that never did nor never shall So much as frown on you HUBERT I have sworn to do it And with hot irons must I burn them out ARTHUR Ah none but in this iron age would do it The iron of itself though heat redhot Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears And quench his fiery indignation Even in the matter of mine innocence Nay after that consume away in rust But for containing fire to harm mine eye Are you more stubbornhard than hammerd iron An if an angel should have come to me And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes I would not have believd him No tongue but HubertsHUBERT Stamps Come forth Enter Executioners with cords irons c Do as I bid you do ARTHUR O save me Hubert save me My eyes are out Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men HUBERT Give

men away And I will sit as quiet as a lamb I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word Nor look upon the iron angerly Thrust but these men away and Ill forgive you Whatever torment you do put me to HUBERT Go stand within let me alone with him FIRST EXECUTIONER I am best pleasd to be from such a deed Exeunt Executioners ARTHUR Alas I then have chid away my friend He hath a stern look but a gentle heart Let him come back that his compassion may Give life to yours HUBERT Come boy prepare yourself ARTHUR Is there no remedy HUBERT None but to lose your eyes ARTHUR O heaven that there were but a mote in yours A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair Any annoyance in that precious sense Then feeling what small things are boisterous there Your vile intent must needs seem horrible HUBERT Is this your promise Go to hold your tongue ARTHUR Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes Let me not hold my tongue Let me not Hubert Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes Though to no use but still to look on you Lo by my troth the instrument is cold And would not harm me HUBERT I can heat it boy ARTHUR No in good sooth the fire is dead with grief Being create for comfort to be usd In undeservd extremes See else yourself There is no malice in this burning coal The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out And strewd repentant ashes on his head HUBERT But with my breath I can revive it boy ARTHUR An if you do you will but make it blush And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes And like a dog that is compelld to fight Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on All things that you should use to do me wrong Deny their office Only you do lack That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends Creatures of note for mercylacking uses HUBERT Well see to live I will not touch thine eye For all the treasure that thine uncle owes Yet I am sworn and I did purpose boy With this same very iron to burn them out ARTHUR O now you look like Hubert All this while You were disguised HUBERT Peace no more Adieu Your uncle must not know but you are dead Ill fill these dogged spies with false reports And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure That Hubert for the wealth of all the world Will not offend thee ARTHUR O heaven I thank you Hubert HUBERT Silence no more Go closely in with me Much danger do I undergo for thee Exeunt SCENE II The same A Room of State in the Palace Enter King John crowned Pembroke Salisbury and other Lords The King takes his State KING JOHN Here once again we sit once again crownd And lookd upon I hope with cheerful eyes PEMBROKE This once again but that your highness pleasd Was once superfluous You were crownd before And that high royalty was neer pluckd off The faiths of men neer stained with revolt Fresh expectation troubled not the land With any longdfor change or better state SALISBURY Therefore to be possessd with double pomp To guard a title that was rich before To gild refined gold to paint the lily To throw a perfume on the violet To smooth the ice or add another hue Unto the rainbow or with taperlight To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish Is wasteful and ridiculous excess PEMBROKE But that your royal pleasure must be done This act is as an ancient tale new told And in the last repeating troublesome Being urged at a time unseasonable SALISBURY In this the antique and wellnoted face Of plain old form is much disfigured And like a shifted wind unto a sail It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about Startles and frights consideration Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected For putting on so new a fashiond robe PEMBROKE When workmen strive to do better than well They do confound their skill in covetousness And oftentimes excusing of a fault Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse As patches set upon a little breach Discredit more in hiding of the fault Than did the fault before it was so patchd SALISBURY To this effect before you were newcrownd We breathd our counsel but it pleasd your highness To overbear it and we are all well pleasd Since all and every part of what we would Doth make a stand at what your highness will KING JOHN Some reasons of this double coronation I have possessd you with and think them strong And more more strong when lesser is my fear I shall indue you with Meantime but ask What you would have reformd that is not well And well shall you perceive how willingly I will both hear and grant you your requests PEMBROKE Then I as one that am the tongue of these To sound the purposes of all their hearts Both for myself and them but chief of all Your safety for the which myself and them Bend their best studies heartily request Th enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent To break into this dangerous argument If what in rest you have in right you hold Why then your fears which as they say attend The steps of wrong should move you to mew up Your tender kinsman and to choke his days With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth The rich advantage of good exercise That the times enemies may not have this To grace occasions let it be our suit That you have bid us ask his liberty Which for our goods we do no further ask Than whereupon our weal on you depending Counts it your weal he have his liberty KING JOHN Let it be so I do commit his youth To your direction Enter Hubert Hubert what news with you Taking him apart PEMBROKE This is the man should do the bloody deed He showd his warrant to a friend of mine The image of a wicked heinous fault Lives in his eye that close aspect of his Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast And I do fearfully believe tis done What we so feard he had a charge to do SALISBURY The colour of the King doth come and go Between his purpose and his conscience Like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set His passion is so ripe it needs must break PEMBROKE And when it breaks I fear will issue thence The foul corruption of a sweet childs death KING JOHN We cannot hold mortalitys strong hand Good lords although my will to give is living The suit which you demand is gone and dead He tells us Arthur is deceasd tonight SALISBURY Indeed we feard his sickness was past cure PEMBROKE Indeed we heard how near his death he was Before the child himself felt he was sick This must be answerd either here or hence KING JOHN Why do you bend such solemn brows on me Think you I bear the shears of destiny Have I commandment on the pulse of life SALISBURY It is apparent foulplay and tis shame That greatness should so grossly offer it So thrive it in your game and so farewell PEMBROKE Stay yet Lord Salisbury Ill go with thee And find th inheritance of this poor child His little kingdom of a forced grave That blood which owd the breadth of all this isle Three foot of it doth hold Bad world the while This must not be thus borne this will break out To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt Exeunt Lords KING JOHN They burn in indignation I repent There is no sure foundation set on blood No certain life achievd by others death Enter a Messenger A fearful eye thou hast Where is that blood That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks So foul a sky clears not without a storm Pour down thy weather how goes all in France MESSENGER From France to England Never such a power For any foreign preparation Was levied in the body of a land The copy of your speed is learnd by them For when you should be told they do prepare The tidings comes that they are all arrivd KING JOHN O where hath our intelligence been drunk Where hath it slept Where is my mothers care That such an army could be drawn in France And she not hear of it MESSENGER My liege her ear Is stoppd with dust The first of April died Your noble mother and as I hear my lord The Lady Constance in a frenzy died Three days before But this from rumours tongue I idly heard if true or false I know not KING JOHN Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion O make a league with me till I have pleasd My discontented peers What Mother dead How wildly then walks my estate in France Under whose conduct came those powers of France That thou for truth givst out are landed here MESSENGER Under the Dauphin KING JOHN Thou hast made me giddy With these in tidings Enter the Bastard and Peter of Pomfret Now what says the world To your proceedings Do not seek to stuff My head with more ill news for it is full BASTARD But if you be afeard to hear the worst Then let the worst unheard fall on your head KING JOHN Bear with me cousin for I was amazd Under the tide but now I breathe again Aloft the flood and can give audience To any tongue speak it of what it will BASTARD How I have sped among the clergymen The sums I have collected shall express But as I travailld hither through the land I find the people strangely fantasied Possessd with rumours full of idle dreams Not knowing what they fear but full of fear And heres a prophet that I brought with me From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found With many hundreds treading on his heels To whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes That ere the next Ascensionday at noon Your highness should deliver up your crown KING JOHN Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so PETER OF POMFRET Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so KING JOHN Hubert away with him imprison him And on that day at noon whereon he says I shall yield up my crown let him be hangd Deliver him to safety and return For I must use thee Exit Hubert with Peter O my gentle cousin Hearst thou the news abroad who are arrivd BASTARD The French my lord Mens mouths are full of it Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury With eyes as red as newenkindled fire And others more going to seek the grave Of Arthur whom they say is killd tonight On your suggestion KING JOHN Gentle kinsman go And thrust thyself into their companies I have a way to will their loves againBring them before me BASTARD I will seek them out KING JOHN Nay but make haste the better foot before O let me have no subject enemies When adverse foreigners affright my towns With

HUBERT My lord they say five moons were seen tonight Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about The other four in wondrous motion KING JOHN Five moons HUBERT Old men and beldams in the streets Do prophesy upon it dangerously Young Arthurs death is common in their mouths And when they talk of him they shake their heads And whisper one another in the ear And he that speaks doth gripe the hearers wrist Whilst he that hears makes fearful action With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool With open mouth swallowing a tailors news Who with his shears and measure in his hand Standing on slippers which his nimble haste Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet Told of a many thousand warlike French That were embattailed and rankd in Kent Another lean unwashd artificer Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthurs death KING JOHN Why seekst thou to possess me with these fears Why urgest thou so oft young Arthurs death Thy hand hath murderd him I had a mighty cause To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him HUBERT No had my lord Why did you not provoke me KING JOHN It is the curse of kings to be attended By slaves that take their humours for a warrant To break within the bloody house of life And on the winking of authority To understand a law to know the meaning Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns More upon humour than advisd respect HUBERT Here is your hand and seal for what I did KING JOHN O when the last account twixt heaven and earth Is to be made then shall this hand and seal Witness against us to damnation How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by A fellow by the hand of nature markd Quoted and signd to do a deed of shame This murder had not come into my mind But taking note of thy abhorrd aspect Finding thee fit for bloody villainy Apt liable to be employd in danger I faintly broke with thee of Arthurs death And thou to be endeared to a king Made it no conscience to destroy a prince HUBERT My lord KING JOHN Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause When I spake darkly what I purposd Or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face As bid me tell my tale in express words Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me But thou didst understand me by my signs And didst in signs again parley with sin Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent And consequently thy rude hand to act The deed which both our tongues held vile to name Out of my sight and never see me more My nobles leave me and my state is bravd Even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers Nay in the body of the fleshly land This kingdom this confine of blood and breath Hostility and civil tumult reigns Between my conscience and my cousins death HUBERT Arm you against your other enemies Ill make a peace between your soul and you Young Arthur is alive This hand of mine Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand Not painted with the crimson spots of blood Within this bosom never enterd yet The dreadful motion of a murderous thought And you have slanderd nature in my form Which howsoever rude exteriorly Is yet the cover of a fairer mind Than to be butcher of an innocent child KING JOHN Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers Throw this report on their incensed rage And make them tame to their obedience Forgive the comment that my passion made Upon thy feature for my rage was blind And foul imaginary eyes of blood Presented thee more hideous than thou art O answer not but to my closet bring The angry lords with all expedient haste I conjure thee but slowly run more fast Exeunt SCENE III The same Before the castle Enter Arthur on the walls ARTHUR The wall is high and yet will I leap down Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not Theres few or none do know me If they did This shipboys semblance hath disguisd me quite I am afraid and yet Ill venture it If I get down and do not break

a heavy hand If that it be the work of any hand SALISBURY If that it be the work of any hand We had a kind of light what would ensue It is the shameful work of Huberts hand The practice and the purpose of the King From whose obedience I forbid my soul Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life And breathing to his breathless excellence The incense of a vow a holy vow Never to taste the pleasures of the world Never to be infected with delight Nor conversant with ease and idleness Till I have set a glory to this hand By giving it the worship of revenge PEMBROKE and BIGOT Our souls religiously confirm thy words Enter Hubert HUBERT Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you Arthur doth live the King hath sent for you SALISBURY O he is bold and blushes not at death Avaunt thou

arms I am amazd methinks and lose my way Among the thorns and dangers of this world How easy dost thou take all England up From forth this morsel of dead royalty The life the right and truth of all this realm Is fled to heaven and England now is left To tug and scamble and to part by th teeth The unowd interest of proudswelling state Now for the barepickd bone of majesty Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace Now powers from home and discontents at home Meet in one line and vast confusion waits As doth a raven on a sickfalln beast The imminent decay

exceptless rashness You perpetual sober gods I do proclaim One honest man mistake me not but one No more I pray and hes a steward How fain would I have hated all mankind And thou redeemst thyself But

Certain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him He likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum POET Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends PAINTER Nothing else You shall see him a palm in Athens again and flourish with the highest Therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his It will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be a just and true report that goes of his having POET What have you now to present unto him PAINTER Nothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent piece POET I must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming toward him PAINTER Good as the best Promising is the very air o th time it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it Enter Timon from his cave TIMON Aside Excellent workman Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself POET I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him It must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency TIMON Aside Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men Do so I have gold for thee POET Nay lets seek him Then do we sin against our own estate When we may profit meet and come too late PAINTER True When the day serves before blackcornered night Find what thou wantst by free and offered light Come TIMON Aside Ill meet you at the turn What a gods gold That he is worshipped in a baser temple Than where swine feed Tis thou that riggst the bark and ploughst the foam Settlest admired reverence in a slave To thee be worship and thy saints for aye Be crowned with plagues that thee alone obey Fit I meet them He comes forward POET Hail worthy Timon

abhorred spirits Not all the whips of heaven are large enough What to you Whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence To their whole being I am rapt and cannot cover The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude With any size of words TIMON Let it go naked Men may seet the better You that are honest by being what you are Make them best seen and known PAINTER He and myself Have travailed in the great shower of your gifts And sweetly felt it TIMON Ay you are honest men PAINTER We are hither come to offer you our service TIMON Most honest men Why how shall I requite you Can you eat roots and drink cold water No BOTH What we can do well do to do you service TIMON Yere honest men Yeve heard that I have gold I am sure you have Speak truth youre honest men PAINTER So it is said my noble lord but therefore Came not my friend nor I TIMON Good honest men To Painter Thou drawst a counterfeit Best in all Athens Thourt indeed the best Thou counterfeitst most lively PAINTER So so my lord TIMON Een so sir as I say To the Poet And for thy fiction Why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth That thou art even natural in thine art But for all this my honestnatured friends I must needs say you have a little fault Marry tis not monstrous in you neither wish I You take much pains to mend BOTH Beseech your honour To make it known to us TIMON Youll take it ill BOTH Most thankfully my

the other If thou wouldst not reside But where one villain is then him abandon Hence pack Theres gold You came for gold ye slaves To one You have work for me theres payment hence To the other You are an alchemist make gold of that Out rascal dogs Timon drives them out and then retires to his cave SCENE II The same Enter Flavius and two Senators FLAVIUS It is vain that you would speak with Timon For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself which looks like man Is friendly with him FIRST SENATOR Bring us to his cave It is our part and promise to th Athenians To speak with Timon SECOND SENATOR At all times alike Men are not still the same twas time and griefs That framed him thus Time with his fairer hand Offering the fortunes of his former days The former man may make him

Consuming it with speaking FIRST SENATOR Worthy Timon TIMON Of none but such as you and you of Timon FIRST SENATOR The senators of Athens greet thee Timon TIMON Aside I thank them and would send them back the plague Could I but catch it for them FIRST SENATOR O forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee The senators with one consent of love Entreat thee back to Athens who have thought On special dignities which vacant lie For thy best use and wearing SECOND SENATOR They confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross Which now the public body which doth seldom Play the recanter feeling in itself A lack of Timons aid hath sense withal Of its own fall restraining aid to Timon And send forth us to make their sorrowed render Together with a recompense more fruitful Than their

Tis known I ever Have studied physic through which secret art By turning oer authorities I have Together with my practice made familiar To me and to my aid the blest infusions That dwell in vegetives in metals stones And I can speak of the disturbances That nature works and of her cures which doth give me A more content in course of true delight Than to be thirsty after tottering honour Or tie my

Warwick to the Parliament KING HENRY I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man Whateer occasion keeps him from us now QUEEN MARGARET Can you not see or will ye not observe The strangeness of his altered countenance With what a majesty he bears himself How insolent of late he is become How proud how peremptory and unlike himself We know the time since he was mild and affable And if we did but glance a faroff look Immediately he was upon his knee That all the court admired him for submission But meet him now and be it in the morn When everyone will give the time of day He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee Disdaining duty that to us belongs Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England First note that he is near you in descent And should you fall he is the next will mount Me seemeth then it is no policy Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your Highness Council By flattery hath he won the commons hearts And when he please to make commotion Tis to be feared they all will follow him Now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted Suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the Duke If it be fond can it a womans fear Which fear if better reasons can supplant I will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York Reprove my allegation if you can Or else conclude my words effectual SUFFOLK Well hath your highness seen into this Duke And had I first been put to speak my mind I think I should have told your graces tale The Duchess by his subornation Upon my life began her devilish practices Or if he were not privy to those faults Yet by reputing of his high descent As next the King he was successive heir And such high vaunts of his nobility Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess By wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep And in his simple show he harbours treason The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit CARDINAL Did he not contrary to form of law Devise strange deaths for small offences done YORK And did he not in his protectorship Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers pay in France and never sent it By means whereof the towns each day revolted BUCKINGHAM Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey KING HENRY My lords at once the care you have of us To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent From meaning treason to our royal person As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given To dream on evil or to work my downfall QUEEN MARGARET Ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance Seems he a dove His feathers are but borrowed For hes disposed as the hateful raven Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him For hes inclined as is the ravenous wolves Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit Take heed my lord the welfare of us all Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man Enter Somerset SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign KING HENRY Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France SOMERSET That all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you all is lost KING HENRY Cold news Lord Somerset but Gods will be done YORK Aside Cold news for me for I had hope of France As firmly as I hope for fertile England Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud And caterpillars eat my leaves away But I will remedy this gear ere long Or sell my title for a glorious grave Enter Gloucester GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the King Pardon my liege that I have staid so long SUFFOLK Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art I do arrest thee of high treason here GLOUCESTER Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush Nor change my countenance for this arrest A heart unspotted is not easily daunted The purest spring is not so free from mud As I am clear from treason to my sovereign Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty YORK Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France And being Protector stayed the soldiers pay By means whereof his highness hath lost France GLOUCESTER Is it but thought so What are they that think it I never robbed the soldiers of their pay Nor ever had one penny bribe from France So help me God as I have watched the night Ay night by night in studying good for England That doit that eer I wrested from the King Or any groat I hoarded to my use Be brought against me at my trial day No many a pound of mine own proper store Because I would not tax the needy commons Have I dispursed to the garrisons And never asked for restitution CARDINAL It serves you well my lord to say so much GLOUCESTER I say no more than truth so help me God YORK In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of That England was defamed by tyranny GLOUCESTER Why tis well known that whiles I was Protector Pity was all the fault that was in me For I should melt at an offenders tears And lowly words were ransom for their fault Unless it were a bloody murderer Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers I never gave them condign punishment Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortured Above the felon or what trespass else SUFFOLK My lord these faults are easy quickly answered But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself I do arrest you in his highness name And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal To keep until your further time of trial KING HENRY My Lord of Gloucester tis my special hope That you will clear yourself from all suspense My conscience tells me you are innocent GLOUCESTER Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous Virtue is choked with foul ambition And charity chased hence by rancours hand Foul subornation is predominant And equity exiled your highness land I know their complot is to have my life And if my death might make this island happy And prove the period of their tyranny I would expend it with all willingness But mine is made the prologue to their play For thousands more that yet suspect no peril Will not conclude their plotted tragedy Beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice And Suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue The envious load that lies upon his heart And dogged York that reaches at the moon Whose overweening arm I have plucked back By false accuse doth level at my life And you my sovereign lady with the rest Causeless have laid disgraces on my head And with your best endeavour have stirred up My liefest liege to be mine enemy Ay all of you have laid your heads together Myself had notice of your conventicles And all to make away my guiltless life I shall not want false witness to condemn me Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt The ancient proverb will be well effected A staff is quickly found to beat a dog CARDINAL My liege his railing is intolerable If those that care to keep your royal person From treasons secret knife and traitors rage Be thus upbraided chid and rated at And the offender granted scope of speech Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace SUFFOLK Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here With ignominious words though clerkly couched As if she had suborned some to swear False allegations to oerthrow his state QUEEN MARGARET But I can give the loser leave to chide GLOUCESTER Far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed Beshrew the winners for they played me false And well such losers may have leave to speak BUCKINGHAM Hell wrest the sense and hold us here all day Lord Cardinal he is your prisoner CARDINAL Sirs take away the Duke and guard him sure GLOUCESTER Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch Before his legs be firm to bear his body Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first Ah that my fear were false ah that it wereFor good King Henry thy decay I fear Exit Gloucester guarded KING HENRY My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best Do or undo as if ourself were here QUEEN MARGARET What will your highness leave the parliament KING HENRY Ay Margaret my heart is drowned with grief Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes My body round engirt with misery For whats more miserable than discontent Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see The map of honour truth and loyalty And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come That eer I proved thee false or feared thy faith What louring star now envies thy estate That these great lords and Margaret our Queen Do seek subversion of thy harmless life Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong And as the butcher takes away the calf And binds the wretch and beats it when it strains Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse Even so remorseless have they borne him hence And as the dam runs lowing up and down Looking the way her harmless young one went And can do naught but wail her darlings loss Even so myself bewails good Gloucesters case With sad unhelpful tears and with dimmed eyes Look after him and cannot do him good So mighty are his vowed enemies His fortunes I will weep and twixt each groan Say Whos a traitor Gloucester he is none Exeunt all but Queen Cardinal Beaufort Suffolk and York Somerset remains apart QUEEN MARGARET Free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams Henry my lord is cold in great affairs Too full of foolish pity and Gloucesters show Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile With sorrow snares relenting passengers Or as the snake rolled in a flowering bank With shining checkered slough doth sting a child That for the beauty thinks it excellent Believe me lords were none more wise than I And yet herein I judge mine own wit good This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world To rid us from the fear we have of him CARDINAL That he should die is worthy policy But yet we want a colour for his death Tis meet he be condemned by course of law SUFFOLK But in my mind that were no policy The King will labour still to save his life The commons haply rise to save his life And yet we have but trivial argument More than mistrust that shows him worthy death YORK So that by this you would not have him die SUFFOLK Ah York no man alive so fain as I YORK Tis York that hath more reason for his death But my Lord Cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk Say as you think and speak it from your souls Were t not all one an empty eagle were set To guard the chicken from a hungry kite As place Duke Humphrey for the Kings Protector QUEEN MARGARET So the poor chicken should be sure of death SUFFOLK Madam tis true and were t not madness then To make the fox surveyor of the fold Who being accused a crafty murderer His guilt should be but idly posted over Because his purpose is not executed No let him die in that he is a fox By nature proved an enemy to the flock Before his chaps be stained with crimson blood As Humphrey proved by reasons to my liege And do not stand on quillets how to slay him Be it by gins by snares by subtlety Sleeping or waking tis no matter how So he be dead for that is good deceit Which mates him first that first intends deceit QUEEN MARGARET Thricenoble Suffolk tis resolutely spoke SUFFOLK Not resolute except so much were done For things are often spoke and seldom meant But that my heart accordeth with my tongue Seeing the deed is meritorious And to preserve my sovereign from his foe Say but the word and I will be his priest CARDINAL But I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk

are up And put the Englishmen unto the sword Send succours lords and stop the rage betime Before the wound do grow uncurable For being green there is great hope of help CARDINAL A breach that craves a quick expedient stop What counsel give you in this weighty cause YORK That Somerset be sent as regent thither Tis meet that lucky ruler be employed Witness the fortune he hath had in France SOMERSET If York with all his farfet policy Had been the regent there instead of me He never would have stayed in France so long YORK No not to lose it all as thou hast done I rather would have lost my life betimes Than bring a burden of dishonour home By staying there so long till all were lost Show me one scar charactered on thy skin Mens flesh preserved so whole do seldom win QUEEN MARGARET Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with No more good York Sweet Somerset be still Thy fortune York hadst thou been regent there Might happily have proved far

all for Ireland SUFFOLK Ill see it truly done my Lord of York Exeunt all but York YORK Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts And change misdoubt to resolution Be that thou hopst to be or what thou art Resign to death it is not worth th enjoying Let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man And find no harbour in a royal heart Faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought And not a thought but thinks on dignity My brain more busy than the labouring spider Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies Well nobles well tis politicly done To send me packing with an host of men I fear me you but warm the starved snake Who cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts Twas men I lacked and you will give them me I take it kindly yet be well assured You put sharp weapons in a madmans hands Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band I will stir up in England some black storm Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage Until the golden circuit on my head Like to the glorious suns transparent beams Do calm the fury of this madbred flaw And for a minister of my intent I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman John Cade of Ashford To make commotion as full well he can Under the title of John Mortimer In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade Oppose himself against a troop of kerns And fought so long till that his thighs with darts Were almost like a sharpquilled porpentine And in the end being rescued I have seen Him caper upright like a wild Morisco Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells Full often like a shaghaired crafty kern Hath he conversed with the enemy And undiscovered come to me again And given me notice of their villainies This devil here shall be my substitute For that John Mortimer which now is dead In face in gait in speech he doth resemble By this I shall perceive the commons mind How they affect the house and claim of York Say he be taken racked and tortured I know no pain they can inflict upon him Will make him say I moved him to those arms Say that he thrive as tis great like he will Why then from Ireland come I with my strength And reap the harvest which that rascal sowed For Humphrey being dead as he shall be And Henry put apart the next for me Exit SCENE II Bury St Edmunds A Room of State Enter two or three Murderers running over the stage from the murder of Duke Humphrey 1 MURDERER Run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know We have dispatched the Duke as he commanded 2 MURDERER O that it were to do What have we done Didst ever hear a man so penitent Enter Suffolk

esteem He be approved in practice culpable QUEEN MARGARET God forbid any malice should prevail That faultless may condemn a nobleman Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion KING HENRY I thank thee Meg these words content me much Enter Suffolk How now Why lookst thou pale Why tremblest thou Where is our uncle Whats the matter Suffolk SUFFOLK Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead QUEEN MARGARET Marry God forfend CARDINAL Gods secret judgment I did dream tonight The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word The King swoons QUEEN MARGARET How fares my lord Help lords the King is dead SOMERSET Rear up his body wring him by the nose QUEEN MARGARET Run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes SUFFOLK He doth revive again Madam be patient KING HENRY O heavenly God QUEEN MARGARET How fares my gracious lord SUFFOLK Comfort my sovereign Gracious Henry comfort KING HENRY What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me Came he right now to sing a ravens note Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powersAnd thinks he that the chirping of a wren By crying comfort from a hollow breast Can chase away the firstconceived sound Hide not thy poison with such sugared words Lay not thy hands on me Forbear I say Their touch affrights me as a serpents sting Thou baleful messenger out of my sight Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny Sits in grim majesty to fright the world Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding Yet do not go away come basilisk And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight For in the shade of death I shall find joy In life but double death now Gloucesters dead QUEEN MARGARET Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus Although the Duke was enemy to him Yet he most Christianlike laments his death And for myself foe as he was to me Might liquid tears or heartoffending groans Or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life I would be blind with weeping sick with groans Look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs And all to have the noble Duke alive What know I how the world may deem of me For it is known we were but hollow friends It may be judged I made the Duke away So shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded And princes courts be filled with my reproach This get I by his death Ay me unhappy To be a queen and crowned with infamy KING HENRY Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man QUEEN MARGARET Be woe for me more wretched than he is What dost thou turn away and hide thy face I am no loathsome leper Look on me What art thou like the adder waxen deaf Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn Queen Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucesters tomb Why then Dame Margaret was neer thy joy Erect his statue and worship it And make my image but an alehouse sign Was I for this nigh wracked upon the sea And twice by awkward wind from Englands bank Drove back again unto my native clime What boded this but well forewarning wind Did seem to say Seek not a scorpions nest Nor set no footing on this unkind shore What did I then but cursed the gentle gusts And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves And bid them blow towards Englands blessed shore Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer But left that hateful office unto thee The prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me Knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness The splitting rocks cowered in the sinking sands And would not dash me with their ragged sides Because thy flinty heart more hard than they Might in thy palace perish Margaret As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs When from thy shore the tempest beat us back I stood upon the hatches in the storm And when the dusky sky began to rob My earnestgaping sight of thy lands view I took a costly jewel from my neck A heart it was bound in with diamonds And threw it towards thy land The sea received it And so I wished thy body might my heart And even with this I lost fair Englands view And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart And called them blind and dusky spectacles For losing ken of Albions wished coast How often have I tempted Suffolks tongue The agent of thy foul inconstancy To sit and witch me as Ascanius did When he to madding Dido would unfold His fathers acts commenced in burning Troy Am I not witched like her Or thou not false like him Ay me I can no more Die Margaret For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long Noise within Enter Warwick Salisbury and many Commons WARWICK It is reported mighty sovereign That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murdered By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beauforts means The commons like an angry hive of bees That want their leader scatter up and down And care not who they sting in his revenge Myself have calmed their spleenful mutiny Until they hear the order of his death KING HENRY That he is dead good Warwick tis too true But how he died God knows not Henry Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse And comment then upon his sudden death WARWICK That shall I do my liegeStay Salisbury With the rude multitude till I return Warwick exits through one door Salisbury and Commons exit through another KING HENRY O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul Some violent hands were laid on Humphreys life If my suspect be false forgive me God For judgment only doth belong to Thee Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips With twenty thousand kisses and to drain Upon his face an ocean of salt tears To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling But all in vain are these mean obsequies And to survey his dead and earthy image What were it but to make my sorrow greater Enter Warwick and others bearing Gloucesters body on a bed WARWICK Come hither gracious sovereign view this body KING HENRY That is to see how deep my grave is made For with his soul fled all my worldly solace For seeing him I see my life in death WARWICK As surely as my soul intends to live With that dread King that took our state upon Him To free us from His Fathers wrathful curse I do believe that violent hands were laid Upon the life of this thricefamed duke SUFFOLK A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow WARWICK See how the blood is settled in his face Oft have I seen a timelyparted ghost Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless Being all descended to the labouring heart Who in the conflict that it holds with death Attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy Which with the heart there cools and neer returneth To blush and beautify the cheek again But see his face is black and full of blood His eyeballs further out than when he lived Staring full ghastly like a strangled man His hair upreared his nostrils stretched with struggling His hands abroad displayed as one that grasped And tugged for life and was by strength subdued Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking His wellproportioned beard made rough and rugged Like to the summers corn by tempest lodged It cannot be but he was murdered here The least of all these signs were probable SUFFOLK Why Warwick who should do the Duke to death Myself and Beaufort had him in protection And we I hope sir are no murderers WARWICK But both of you were vowed Duke Humphreys foes And you forsooth had the good Duke to keep Tis like you would not feast him like a friend And tis well seen he found an enemy QUEEN MARGARET Then you belike suspect these noblemen As guilty of Duke Humphreys timeless death WARWICK Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh And sees fast by a butcher with an axe But will suspect twas he that made the slaughter Who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest But may imagine how the bird was dead Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak Even so suspicious is this tragedy QUEEN MARGARET Are you the butcher Suffolk Wheres your knife Is Beaufort termed a kite Where are his talons SUFFOLK I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men But heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart That slanders me with murders crimson badge Say if thou darst proud Lord of Warwickshire That I am faulty in Duke Humphreys death Exeunt Cardinal Somerset and others WARWICK What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him QUEEN MARGARET He dares not calm his contumelious spirit Nor cease to be an arrogant controller Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times WARWICK Madam be still with reverence may I say For every word you speak in his behalf Is slander to your royal dignity SUFFOLK Bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanour If ever lady wronged her lord so much Thy mother took into her blameful bed Some stern untutored churl and noble stock Was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art And never of the Nevilles noble race WARWICK But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee And I should rob the deathsman of his fee Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames And that my sovereigns presence makes me mild I would false murderous coward on thy knee Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech And say it was thy mother that thou meantst That thou thyself wast born in bastardy And after all this fearful homage done Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men SUFFOLK Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood If from this presence thou darst go with me WARWICK Away even now or I will drag thee hence Unworthy though thou art Ill cope with thee And do some service to Duke Humphreys ghost Exeunt Suffolk and Warwick KING HENRY What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just And he but naked though locked up in steel Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted A noise within QUEEN MARGARET What noise is this Enter Suffolk and Warwick with their weapons drawn KING HENRY Why how now lords Your wrathful weapons drawn Here in our presence Dare you be so bold Why what tumultuous clamour have we here SUFFOLK The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury Set all upon me mighty sovereign Enter Salisbury SALISBURY To the Commons entering Sirs stand apart the King shall know your mind Dread lord the commons send you word by me Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death Or banished fair Englands territories They will by violence tear him from your palace And torture him with grievous lingering death They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died They say in him they fear your highness death And mere instinct of love and loyalty Free from a stubborn opposite intent As being thought to contradict your liking Makes them thus forward in his banishment They say in care of your most royal person That if your highness should intend to sleep And charge that no man should disturb your rest In pain of your dislike or pain of death Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue That slyly glided towards your majesty It were but necessary you were waked Lest being suffered in that harmful slumber The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal And therefore do they cry though you forbid That they will guard you wheer you will or no From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is With whose envenomed and fatal sting Your loving uncle twenty times his worth They say is shamefully bereft of life COMMONS Within An answer from the King my Lord of SalisburySUFFOLK Tis like the commons rude unpolished hinds Could send such message to their sovereign But you my lord were glad to be employed To show how quaint an orator you are But all the honour Salisbury hath won Is that he was the lord ambassador Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King COMMONS Within An answer from the King or we will all break in KING HENRY Go Salisbury and tell them all from me I thank them for their tender loving care And had I not been cited so by them Yet did I purpose as they do entreat For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy Mischance unto my state by Suffolks means And therefore by His majesty I swear Whose far unworthy deputy I am He shall not breathe infection in this air But three days longer on the pain of death Exit Salisbury QUEEN MARGARET O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk KING HENRY Ungentle Queen to call him gentle Suffolk No more I say if thou dost plead for him Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath Had I but said I would have kept my word But when I swear it is irrevocable If after three days space thou here best found On any ground that I am ruler of The world shall not be ransom for thy life Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me I have great matters to impart to thee Exeunt all but Queen and Suffolk QUEEN MARGARET Mischance and sorrow go along with you Hearts discontent and sour affliction Be playfellows to keep you company Theres two of you the devil make a third And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps SUFFOLK Cease gentle Queen these execrations And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave QUEEN MARGARET Fie coward woman and softhearted wretch Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemies SUFFOLK A plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them Could curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan I would invent as bitter searching terms As curst as harsh and horrible to hear Delivered strongly through my fixed teeth With full as many signs of deadly hate As leanfaced Envy in her loathsome cave My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint Mine hair be fixed on end as one distract Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban And even now my burdened heart would break Should I not curse them Poison be their drink Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste Their sweetest shade a grove of cypresstrees Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks Their softest touch as smart as lizards stings Their music frightful as the serpents hiss And boding screechowls make the consort full All the foul terrors in darkseated hell QUEEN MARGARET Enough sweet Suffolk thou tormentst thyself And these dread curses like the sun gainst glass Or like an overcharged gun recoil And turns the force of them upon thyself SUFFOLK You bade me ban and will you bid me leave Now by the ground that I am banished from Well could I curse away a winters night Though standing naked on a mountain top Where biting cold would never let grass grow And think it but a minute spent in sport QUEEN MARGARET O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand That I may dew it with my mournful tears Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place To wash away my woeful monuments O could this kiss be printed in thy hand That thou mightst think upon these by the seal Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee So get thee gone that I may know my grief Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by As one that surfeits thinking on a want I will repeal thee or be well assured Adventure to be banished myself And banished I am if but from thee Go speak not to me even now be gone O go not yet Even thus two friends condemned Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves Loather a hundred times to part than die Yet now farewell and farewell life with thee SUFFOLK Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished Once by the King and three times thrice by thee Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence A wilderness is populous enough So Suffolk had thy heavenly company For where thou art there is the world itself With every several pleasure in the world And where thou art not desolation I can no more Live thou to joy thy life Myself no joy in nought but that thou livst Enter Vaux QUEEN MARGARET Whither goes Vaux so fast What news I prithee VAUX To signify unto his majesty That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death For suddenly a grievous sickness took him That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphreys ghost Were by his side sometime he calls the King And whispers to his pillow as to him The secrets of his overcharged soul And I am sent to tell his majesty That even now he cries aloud for him QUEEN MARGARET Go tell this heavy message to the King Exit Vaux Ay me What is this world What news are these But wherefore grieve I at an hours poor loss Omitting Suffolks exile my souls treasure Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee And with the southern clouds contend in tears Theirs for the earths increase mine for my sorrows Now get thee hence The King thou knowst is coming If thou be found by me thou art but dead SUFFOLK If I depart from thee I cannot live And in thy sight to die what were it else But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap Here could I breathe my soul into the air As mild and gentle as the cradlebabe Dying with mothers dug between its lips Where from thy sight I should be raging mad And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul Or I should breathe it so into thy body And then it lived in sweet Elysium To die by thee were but to die in jest From thee to die were torture more than death O let me stay befall what may befall QUEEN MARGARET Away Though parting be a fretful corrosive It is applied to a deathful wound To France sweet Suffolk Let me hear from thee For wheresoer thou art in this worlds globe Ill have an Iris that shall find thee out SUFFOLK I go QUEEN MARGARET And take my heart with thee SUFFOLK A jewel locked into the woefullst cask That ever did contain a thing of worth Even as a splitted bark so sunder we This way fall I to death QUEEN MARGARET This way for me Exeunt severally SCENE III A Bedchamber Enter the King Salisbury and Warwick to the Cardinal in bed KING HENRY How fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign CARDINAL If thou best Death Ill give thee Englands treasure Enough to purchase such another island So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain KING HENRY Ah what a sign it is of evil life Where deaths approach is seen so terrible WARWICK Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee CARDINAL Bring me unto my trial when you will Died he not in his bed Where should he die Can I make men live wheer they will or no O torture me no more I will confess Alive again Then show me where he is Ill give a thousand pound to look upon him He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them Comb down his hair look look it stands upright Like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul Give me some drink and bid the apothecary Bring the strong poison that I bought of him KING HENRY O Thou eternal mover of the heavens Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch O beat away the busy meddling fiend That lays strong siege unto this wretchs soul And from his bosom purge this black despair WARWICK See how the pangs of death do make him grin SALISBURY Disturb him not let him pass peaceably KING HENRY Peace to his soul if Gods good pleasure be Lord Cardinal if thou thinkst on heavens bliss Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope He dies and makes no sign O God forgive him WARWICK So bad a death argues a monstrous life KING HENRY Forbear to judge for we are sinners all Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close And let us all to meditation Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I The Coast of Kent Alarum Fight at sea Ordnance goes off Enter a Lieutenant Suffolk disguised a prisoner The Master a Masters Mate Walter Whitmore and prisoners

London Enter Mortimer brought in a chair and Jailers MORTIMER Kind keepers of my weak decaying age Let dying Mortimer here rest himself Even like a man new haled from the rack So fare my limbs with long imprisonment And these gray locks the pursuivants of death Nestorlike aged in an age of care Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent Wax dim as drawing to their exigent Weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief And pithless arms like to a witherd vine That droops his sapless branches to the ground Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb Unable to support this lump of clay Swiftwinged with desire to get a grave As witting I no other comfort have But tell me keeper will my nephew come FIRST JAILER Richard Plantagenet my lord will come We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber And answer was returnd that he will come MORTIMER Enough My soul shall then be satisfied Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign Before whose glory I was great in arms This loathsome sequestration have I had And even since then hath Richard been obscured Deprived of honour and inheritance But now the arbitrator of despairs Just Death kind umpire of mens miseries With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence I would his troubles likewise were expired That so he might recover what was lost Enter Richard Plantagenet FIRST JAILER My lord your loving nephew now is come MORTIMER Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come PLANTAGENET Ay noble uncle thus ignobly used Your nephew late despised Richard comes MORTIMER Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck And in his bosom spend my latter gasp O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks That I may kindly give one fainting kiss And now declare sweet stem from Yorks great stock Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised PLANTAGENET First lean thine aged back against mine arm And in that ease Ill tell thee my disease This day in argument upon a case Some words there grew twixt Somerset and me Among which terms he used his lavish tongue And did upbraid me with my fathers death Which obloquy set bars before my tongue Else with the like I had requited him Therefore good uncle for my fathers sake In honour of a true Plantagenet And for alliance sake declare the cause My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head MORTIMER That cause fair nephew that imprisond me And hath detaind me all my flowering youth Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine Was cursed instrument of his decease PLANTAGENET Discover more at large what cause that was For I am ignorant and cannot guess MORTIMER I will if that my fading breath permit And death approach not ere my tale be done Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king Deposed his nephew Richard Edwards son The firstbegotten and the lawful heir Of Edward king the third of that descent During whose reign the Percies of the north Finding his usurpation most unjust Endeavourd my advancement to the throne The reason moved these warlike lords to this Was for thatyoung King Richard thus removed Leaving no heir begotten of his body I was the next by birth and parentage For by my mother I derived am From Lionel Duke of Clarence third son To King Edward the Third whereas he From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree Being but fourth of that heroic line But mark as in this haughty great attempt They labored to plant the rightful heir I lost my liberty and they their lives Long after this when Henry the Fifth Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign Thy father Earl of Cambridge then derived From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York Marrying my sister that thy mother was Again in pity of my hard distress Levied an army weening to redeem And have installd me in the diadem But as the rest so fell that noble earl And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers In whom the title rested were suppressd PLANTAGENET Of which my lord your honour is the last MORTIMER True and thou seest that I no issue have And that my fainting words do warrant death Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather But yet be wary in thy studious care PLANTAGENET Thy grave admonishments prevail with me But yet methinks my fathers execution Was nothing less than bloody tyranny MORTIMER With silence nephew be thou politic Strongfixed is the house of Lancaster And like a mountain not to be removed But now thy uncle is removing hence As princes do their courts when they are cloyd With long continuance in a settled place PLANTAGENET O uncle would some part of my young years Might but redeem the passage of your age MORTIMER Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth Which giveth many wounds when one will kill Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good Only give order for my funeral And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes And prosperous be thy life in peace and war Dies PLANTAGENET And peace no war befall thy parting soul In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage And like a hermit overpassd thy days Well I will lock his counsel in my breast And what I do imagine let that rest Keepers convey him hence and I myself Will see his burial better than his life Exeunt Jailers bearing out the body of Mortimer Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer Choked with ambition of the meaner sort And for those wrongs those bitter injuries Which Somerset hath offerd to my house I doubt not but with honour to redress And therefore haste I to the Parliament Either to be restored to my blood Or make mine ill th advantage of my good Exit ACT III SCENE I London The Parliament House Flourish Enter King Exeter

late dissension grown betwixt the peers Burns under feigned ashes of forged love And will at last break out into a flame As festered members rot but by degree Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away So will this base and envious discord breed And now I fear that fatal prophecy Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth Was in the mouth of every sucking babe That Henry born at Monmouth should win all And Henry born at Windsor lose all Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish His days may finish ere that hapless time Exit SCENE II France Before Rouen Enter La Pucelle with four Soldiers with

here rest himself Even like a man new haled from the rack So fare my limbs with long imprisonment And these gray locks the pursuivants of death Nestorlike aged in an age of care Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent Wax dim as drawing to their exigent Weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief And pithless arms like to a witherd vine That droops

cause My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head MORTIMER That cause fair nephew that imprisond me And hath detaind me all my flowering youth Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine Was cursed instrument of his decease PLANTAGENET Discover more at large what cause that was For I am ignorant and cannot guess MORTIMER I will if that my fading breath permit And death approach not ere my tale be done Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king Deposed his nephew Richard Edwards son The firstbegotten and the lawful heir Of Edward king the third of that descent During whose reign the Percies of the north Finding his usurpation most unjust Endeavourd my advancement to the throne The reason moved these warlike lords to this Was for thatyoung King Richard thus removed Leaving no heir begotten of his body I was the next by birth and parentage For by my mother I derived am From Lionel Duke of Clarence third son To King Edward the Third whereas he From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree Being but fourth of that heroic line But mark as in this haughty great attempt They labored to plant the rightful heir I lost my liberty and they their lives Long after this when Henry the Fifth Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign Thy father Earl of Cambridge then derived From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York Marrying my sister that thy mother was Again in pity of my hard distress Levied an army weening to redeem And have installd me in the diadem But as the rest so fell that noble earl And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers In whom the title rested were suppressd

Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good Only give order for my funeral And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes And prosperous be thy life in peace and war Dies PLANTAGENET And peace no war befall thy parting soul In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage And like a hermit overpassd thy days Well I will lock his counsel in my breast And what I do imagine let that rest Keepers convey him hence and I myself Will see his burial better than his life Exeunt Jailers bearing out the body of Mortimer Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer Choked with ambition of the meaner sort And for those wrongs

as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia you cannot love her You tell her so Must she not then be answerd DUKE There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart no womans heart So big to hold so much they lack retention Alas their love may be called appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine

mother was a votress of my order And in the spicd Indian air by night Full often hath she gossipd by my side And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands Marking th embarkd traders on the flood When we have laughd to see the sails conceive And grow bigbellied with the wanton wind Which she with pretty and with swimming gait Following her womb then rich with my young squire Would imitate and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again As from a voyage rich with merchandise But she being mortal of that boy did die And for her sake do I rear up her boy And for her sake I will not part with him OBERON How long within this wood intend you stay TITANIA Perchance till after Theseus weddingday If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels go with us If not

Train OBERON Well go thy way Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury My gentle Puck come hither Thou remembrest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphins back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the seamaids music PUCK I remember OBERON That very time I saw but thou couldst not Flying between the cold moon and the earth Cupid all armd a certain aim he took At a fair vestal thrond by the west And loosd his loveshaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft Quenchd in the chaste beams of the watery moon And the imperial votress passed on In maiden meditation fancyfree Yet markd I where the bolt of Cupid fell It fell upon a little western flower Before milkwhite now purple with loves wound And maidens call it loveinidleness Fetch me that flower the herb I showed thee once The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league PUCK Ill put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes Exit Puck OBERON Having once this juiceIll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes The next thing then she waking looks upon Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull On meddling monkey or on busy ape She shall pursue it with the soul of love And ere I take this charm from off her sight As I can take it

sick when I look not on you DEMETRIUS You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity HELENA Your virtue is my privilege for that It is not night when I do see your face Therefore I think I am not in the night Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me DEMETRIUS Ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts HELENA The wildest hath not such a heart as you Run when you will the story shall be changd Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase The dove pursues

oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine With sweet muskroses and with eglantine There sleeps Titania sometime of the night Lulld in these flowers with dances and delight And there the snake throws her enamelld skin Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in And with the juice of this Ill streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies Take thou some of it and seek through this grove A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth Anoint his eyes But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on Effect it with some care that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow PUCK Fear not my lord your servant shall do so

Then what it was that next came in her eye Which she must dote on in extremity Enter Puck Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit What nightrule now about this haunted grove PUCK My mistress with a monster is in love Near to her close and consecrated bower While she was in her dull and sleeping hour A crew of patches rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus nuptial day The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene and enterd in a brake When I did him at this advantage take An asss nole I fixed on his head Anon his Thisbe must be answerd And forth my mimic comes When they him spy As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye Or russetpated choughs many in sort Rising and cawing at the guns report Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky So at his sight away his fellows fly And at our stamp here oer and oer one falls He murder cries and help from Athens calls Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there When in that moment so it came to pass Titania wakd and straightway lovd an ass OBERON This falls out better than I could devise But hast thou yet latchd the Athenians eyes With the lovejuice as I did bid thee do PUCK I took him sleepingthat is finishd too And the Athenian woman by his side That when he wakd of force she must be eyd Enter Demetrius and Hermia OBERON Stand close This is the same Athenian PUCK This is the woman but not this the man DEMETRIUS O why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe HERMIA Now I but chide but I should use thee worse For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me Would he have stoln away From sleeping Hermia Ill believe as soon This whole earth may be bord and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displeaseHer brothers noontide with th Antipodes It cannot be but thou hast murderd him So should a murderer look so dead so grim DEMETRIUS So should the murderd look and so should I Piercd through the heart with your stern cruelty Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere HERMIA Whats this to my Lysander Where is he Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me DEMETRIUS I had rather give his carcass to my hounds HERMIA Out dog Out cur Thou drivst me past the bounds Of maidens patience Hast thou slain him then Henceforth be never numberd among men O once tell true tell true even for my sake Durst thou have lookd upon him being awake And hast thou killd him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm an adder do so much An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine thou serpent never adder stung DEMETRIUS You spend your passion on a misprisd mood I am not guilty of Lysanders blood Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell HERMIA I pray thee tell me then that he is well DEMETRIUS And if I could what should I get therefore HERMIA A privilege never to see me more And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more whether he be dead or no Exit DEMETRIUS There is no following her in this fierce vein Here therefore for a while I will remain So sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay If for his tender here I make some stay Lies down OBERON What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turnd and not a false turnd true PUCK Then fate oerrules that one man holding troth A million fail confounding oath on oath OBERON About the wood go swifter than the wind And Helena of Athens look thou find All fancysick she is and pale of cheer With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear By some illusion see thou bring her here Ill charm his eyes against she do appear PUCK I go I go look how I go Swifter than arrow from the Tartars bow Exit OBERON Flower of this purple dye Hit with Cupids archery Sink in apple of his eye When his love he doth espy Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky When thou wakst if she be by Beg of her for remedy Enter Puck PUCK Captain of our fairy band Helena is here at hand And the youth mistook by me Pleading for a lovers fee Shall we their fond pageant see Lord what fools these mortals be OBERON Stand aside The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake PUCK Then will two at once woo one That must needs be sport alone And those things do best please me That befall prepostrously Enter Lysander and Helena LYSANDER Why should you think that I should woo in scorn Scorn and derision never come in tears Look when I vow I weep and vows so born In their nativity all truth appears How can these things in me seem scorn to you Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true HELENA You do advance your cunning more and more When truth kills truth O devilishholy fray These vows are Hermias will you give her oer Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh Your vows to her and me put in two scales Will even weigh and both as light as tales LYSANDER I had no judgment when to her I swore HELENA Nor none in my mind now you give her oer LYSANDER Demetrius loves her and he loves not you DEMETRIUS Waking O Helen goddess nymph perfect divine To what my love shall I compare thine eyne Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow That pure congeald white high Taurus snow Fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow When thou holdst up thy hand O let me kiss This princess of pure white this seal of bliss HELENA O spite O hell I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment If you were civil and knew courtesy You would not do me thus much injury Can you not hate me as I know you do But you must join in souls to mock me too If you were men as men you are in show You would not use a gentle lady so To vow and swear and superpraise my parts When I am sure you hate me with your hearts You both are rivals and love Hermia And now both rivals to mock Helena A trim exploit a manly enterprise To conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes With your derision None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin and extort A poor souls patience all to make you sport LYSANDER You are unkind Demetrius be not so For you love Hermia this you know I know And here with all good will with all my heart In Hermias love I yield you up my part And yours of Helena to me bequeath Whom I do love and will do till my death HELENA Never did mockers waste more idle breath DEMETRIUS Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none If eer I lovd her all that love is gone My heart to her but as guestwise sojournd And now to Helen is it home returnd There to remain LYSANDER Helen it is not so DEMETRIUS Disparage not the faith thou dost not know Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear Enter Hermia HERMIA Dark night that from the eye his function takes The ear more quick of apprehension makes Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense It pays the hearing double recompense Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so LYSANDER Why should he stay whom love doth press to go HERMIA What love could press Lysander from my side LYSANDER Lysanders love that would not let him bide Fair Helena who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light Why seekst thou me Could not this make thee know The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so HERMIA You speak not as you think it cannot be HELENA Lo she is one of this confederacy Now I perceive they have conjoind all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid Have you conspird have you with these contrivd To bait me with this foul derision Is all the counsel that we two have shard The sisters vows the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hastyfooted time For parting usO is all forgot All schooldays friendship childhood innocence We Hermia like two artificial gods Have with our needles created both one flower Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporate So we grew together Like to a double cherry seeming parted But yet a union in partition Two lovely berries moulded on one stem So with two seeming bodies but one heart Two of the first like coats in heraldry Due but to one and crownd with one crest And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend It is not friendly tis not maidenly Our sex as well as I may chide you for it Though I alone do feel the injury HERMIA I am amazd at your passionate words I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me HELENA Have you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face And made your other love Demetrius Who even but now did spurn me with his foot To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And tender me forsooth affection But by your setting on by your consent What though I be not so in grace as you So hung upon with love so fortunate But miserable most to love unlovd This you should pity rather than despise HERMIA I understand not what you mean by this HELENA Ay do Persever counterfeit sad looks Make mouths upon me when I turn my back Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up This sport well carried shall be chronicled If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument But fare ye well Tis partly my own fault Which death or absence soon shall remedy LYSANDER Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse My love my life my soul fair Helena HELENA O excellent HERMIA Sweet do not scorn her so DEMETRIUS If she cannot entreat I can compel LYSANDER Thou canst compel no more than she entreat Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen I love thee by my life I do I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not DEMETRIUS I say I love thee more than he can do LYSANDER If thou say so withdraw and prove it too DEMETRIUS Quick come HERMIA Lysander whereto tends all this LYSANDER Away you Ethiope DEMETRIUS No no He will Seem to break loose Take on as you would follow But yet come not You are a tame man go LYSANDER Hang off thou cat thou burr Vile thing let loose Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent HERMIA Why are you grown so rude What change is this Sweet love LYSANDER Thy love Out tawny Tartar out Out loathd medicine O hated potion hence HERMIA Do you not jest HELENA Yes sooth and so do you LYSANDER Demetrius I will keep my word with thee DEMETRIUS I would I had your bond for I perceive A weak bond holds you Ill not trust your word LYSANDER What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead Although I hate her Ill not harm her so HERMIA What can you do me greater harm than hate Hate me Wherefore O me what news my love Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander I am as fair now as I was erewhile Since night you lovd me yet since night you left me Why then you left meO the gods forbid In earnest shall I say LYSANDER Ay by my life And never did desire to see thee more Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt Be certain nothing truer tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena HERMIA O me You juggler You cankerblossom You thief of love What have you come by night And stoln my loves heart from him HELENA Fine i faith Have you no modesty no maiden shame No touch of bashfulness What will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you HERMIA Puppet Why so Ay that way goes the game Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures she hath urgd her height And with her personage her tall personage Her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low How low am I thou painted maypole Speak How low am I I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes HELENA I pray you though you mock me gentlemen Let her not hurt me I was never curstI have no gift at all in shrewishness I am a right maid for my cowardice Let her not strike me You perhaps may think Because she is something lower than myself That I can match her HERMIA Lower Hark again HELENA Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me I evermore did love you Hermia Did ever keep your counsels never wrongd you Save that in love unto Demetrius I told him of your stealth unto this wood He followd you for love I followd him But he hath chid me hence and threatend me To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too And now so you will let me quiet go To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further Let me go You see how simple and how fond I am HERMIA Why get you gone Who ist that hinders you HELENA A foolish heart that I leave here behind HERMIA What with Lysander HELENA With Demetrius"

answer PETRUCHIO What HORTENSIO She will not PETRUCHIO The fouler fortune mine and there an end Reenter Katherina BAPTISTA Now by my holidame here comes Katherina KATHERINA What is your will sir that you send for me PETRUCHIO Where is your sister and Hortensios wife KATHERINA They sit conferring by the parlour fire PETRUCHIO Go fetch them hither if they deny to come Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands Away I say and bring them hither straight Exit Katherina LUCENTIO Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder HORTENSIO And so it is I wonder what it bodes PETRUCHIO Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life An awful rule and right supremacy And to be short what not thats sweet and happy BAPTISTA Now fair befall thee good Petruchio The wager thou hast won and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns Another dowry to another daughter For she is changd as she had never been PETRUCHIO Nay I will win my wager better yet And show more sign of her obedience Her

lord thy king thy governor It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds And in no sense is meet or amiable A woman movd is like a fountain troubled Muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty And while it is so none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land To watch the night in storms the day in cold Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love fair looks and true obedience Too little payment for so great a debt Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord I am ashamd that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toil and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts Come come you froward and unable worms My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are Then vail your stomachs

Did us but loving wrong MIRANDA Alack what trouble Was I then to you PROSPERO O a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile Infused with a fortitude from heaven When I have deckd the sea with drops full salt Under my burden groand which raisd in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue MIRANDA How came we ashore PROSPERO By Providence divine Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo Out of his charity who being then appointed Master of this design did give us with Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries Which since have

well fishd for GONZALO When I wore it at your daughters marriage ALONSO You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense Would I had never Married my daughter there for coming thence My son is lost and in my rate she too Who is so far from Italy removed I neer again shall see her O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee FRANCISCO Sir he may live I saw him beat the surges under him And ride upon their backs He trod the water Whose enmity he flung aside and breasted The surge most swoln that met him His bold head Bove the contentious waves he kept and oared Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To th shore that oer his waveworn basis bowed As stooping to relieve him I not doubt He came alive to land ALONSO No no hes gone SEBASTIAN Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss That would not bless our Europe with your daughter But rather lose her to an African Where she at least is banishd from your eye Who hath cause to wet the grief on t ALONSO Prithee peace SEBASTIAN You were kneeld to and importund otherwise By all of us and the fair soul"

not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair What honey is expected Degree being vizarded Thunworthiest shows as fairly in the mask The heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthrond and spherd Amidst the other whose medcinable eye Corrects the influence of evil planets And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shakd Which is the ladder of all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce

This chaos when degree is suffocate Follows the choking And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward with a purpose It hath to climb The generals disdaind By him one step below he by the next That next by him beneath so every step Exampld by the first pace that is sick Of his superior grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation And tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot Not her own sinews To end a tale of length Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength NESTOR Most wisely hath Ulysses here discoverd The fever whereof all our power is sick AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedy ULYSSES The great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries Excellent Tis Agamemnon right Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration Thats doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies weight Why this hath not a fingers dignity They call this bedwork mappry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution NESTOR Let this be granted and Achilles horse Makes many Thetis sons Tucket AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus MENELAUS From Troy Enter Aeneas AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent AENEAS Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you AGAMEMNON Even this AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles arm Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals AGAMEMNON How AENEAS Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers AENEAS Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd As bending angels thats their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Joves accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praisd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends AGAMEMNON Sir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas AENEAS Ay Greek that is my name AGAMEMNON Whats your affairs I pray you AENEAS Sir pardon tis for Agamemnons ears AGAMEMNON He hears naught privately that comes from Troy AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him I bring a trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speak AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnons sleeping hour That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake He tells thee so himself AENEAS Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fairst of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That feeds his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none hell say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so much AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hectors grandsire suckd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put this witherd brawns And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood Ill prove this troth with my three drops of blood AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ULYSSES Amen AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you sir Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor ULYSSES Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape NESTOR What ist ULYSSES This tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be croppd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all NESTOR Well and how ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgement Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose Pointing on him ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you NESTOR Why tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute With their finst palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly poisd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large It is supposd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As twere from forth us all a man distilld Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertaind limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance theyll sell If not the lustre of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are doggd with two strange followers NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should share with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foild Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lottry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off Well dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our projects life this shape of sense assumes Ajax employd plucks down Achilles plumes NESTOR Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone Exeunt ACT II SCENE I The Grecian camp Enter Ajax and Thersites AJAX Thersites THERSITES Agamemnonhow if he had boils full all over generally AJAX Thersites THERSITES And those boils did runsay so Did

THERSITES Dost thou think I have no sense thou strikest me thus AJAX The proclamation THERSITES Thou art proclaimd fool I think AJAX Do not porpentine do not my fingers itch THERSITES I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece When thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another AJAX I say the proclamation THERSITES Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpinas beautyay that thou barkst at him AJAX Mistress Thersites THERSITES Thou shouldst strike him AJAX Cobloaf THERSITES He would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit AJAX You whoreson cur Strikes him THERSITES Do do AJAX Thou stool for a witch THERSITES Ay do do thou soddenwitted lord Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows an asinico may tutor thee You scurvy valiant ass Thou art here but to thrash Trojans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave If thou use to beat me I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou AJAX You dog THERSITES You scurvy lord AJAX You cur Strikes him THERSITES Mars his idiot Do rudeness do camel do do Enter Achilles and Patroclus ACHILLES Why how now Ajax Wherefore do ye thus How now Thersites Whats the matter man THERSITES You see him there do you ACHILLES Ay whats the matter THERSITES Nay look upon him ACHILLES So I do Whats the matter THERSITES Nay but regard him well ACHILLES Well why so I do THERSITES But yet you look not well upon him for whosomever you take him to be he is Ajax ACHILLES I know that fool THERSITES Ay but that fool knows not himself AJAX Therefore I beat thee THERSITES Lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters His evasions have ears thus long I have bobbd his brain more than he has beat my bones I will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow This lord AchillesAjax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his headIll tell you what I say of him ACHILLES What THERSITES I say this Ajax Ajax offers to strike him ACHILLES Nay good Ajax THERSITES Has not so much wit ACHILLES Nay I must hold you THERSITES As will stop the eye of Helens needle for whom he comes to fight ACHILLES Peace fool THERSITES I would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you there AJAX O thou damned cur I shall ACHILLES Will you set your wit to a fools THERSITES No I warrant you the fools will shame it PATROCLUS Good words Thersites ACHILLES Whats the quarrel AJAX I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation and he rails upon me THERSITES I serve thee not AJAX Well go to go to THERSITES I serve here voluntary ACHILLES Your last service was suffrance twas not voluntary No man is beaten voluntary Ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impress THERSITES Een so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars Hector shall have a great catch and knock out either of your brains a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel ACHILLES What with me too Thersites THERSITES Theres Ulysses and old Nestorwhose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toesyoke you like draught oxen and make you plough up the wars ACHILLES What what THERSITES Yes good sooth To Achilles to Ajax to AJAX I shall cut out your tongue THERSITES Tis no matter I shall speak as much as thou afterwards PATROCLUS No more words Thersites peace THERSITES I will hold my peace when Achilles brach bids me shall I ACHILLES Theres for you Patroclus THERSITES I will see you hangd like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools Exit PATROCLUS A good riddance ACHILLES Marry this sir is proclaimd through all our host That Hector by the fifth hour of the sun Will with a trumpet twixt our tents and Troy Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms That hath a stomach and such a one that dare Maintain I know not what tis trash Farewell AJAX Farewell Who shall answer him ACHILLES I know not tis put to lottry otherwise He knew his man AJAX O meaning you I will go learn more of it Exeunt SCENE II Troy Priams palace Enter Priam Hector Troilus Paris and Helenus PRIAM After so many hours lives speeches spent Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks Deliver Helen and all damage else As honour loss of time travail expense Wounds friends and what else dear that is consumd In hot digestion of this cormorant war Shall be struck off Hector what say you tot HECTOR Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I As far as toucheth my particular Yet dread Priam There is no lady of more softer bowels More spongy to suck in the sense of fear More ready to cry out Who knows what follows Than Hector is The wound of peace is surety Surety secure but modest doubt is calld The beacon of the wise the tent that searches To th bottom of the worst Let Helen go Since the first sword was drawn about this question Every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes Hath been as dear as HelenI mean of ours If we have lost so many tenths of ours To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us Had it our name the value of one ten What merits in that reason which denies The yielding of her up TROILUS Fie fie my brother Weigh you the worth and honour of a king So great as our dread fathers in a scale Of common ounces Will you with counters sum The pastproportion of his infinite And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons Fie for godly shame HELENUS No marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons You are so empty of them Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason Because your speech hath none that tells him so TROILUS You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons You know an enemy intends you harm You know a sword employd is perilous And reason flies the object of all harm Who marvels then when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove Or like a star disorbd Nay if we talk of reason Lets shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honour Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts With this crammd reason Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject HECTOR Brother she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping TROILUS Whats aught but as tis valued HECTOR But value dwells not in particular will It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein tis precious of itself As in the prizer Tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the god And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects Without some image of thaffected merit TROILUS I take today a wife and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears Two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgement how may I avoid Although my will distaste what it elected The wife I chose There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soild them nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve Because we now are full It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks Your breath with full consent bellied his sails The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce And did him service He touchd the ports desird And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollos and makes stale the morning Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl Whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships And turnd crownd kings to merchants If youll avouch twas wisdom Paris went As you must needs for you all cried Go go If youll confess he brought home worthy prize As you must needs for you all clappd your hands And cried Inestimablewhy do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate And do a deed that never Fortune did Beggar the estimation which you prizd Richer than sea and land O theft most base That we have stoln what we do fear to keep But thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans cry PRIAM What noise what shriek is this TROILUS Tis our mad sister I do know her voice CASSANDRA Within Cry Trojans HECTOR It is Cassandra Enter Cassandra raving CASSANDRA Cry Trojans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes And I will fill them with prophetic tears HECTOR Peace sister peace CASSANDRA Virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to comeCry Trojans cry Practise your eyes with tears Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all Cry Trojans cry A Helen and a woe Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go Exit HECTOR Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse Or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause Can qualify the same TROILUS Why brother Hector We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandras mad Her brainsick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engagd To make it gracious For my private part I am no more touchd than all Priams sons And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain PARIS Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels But I attest the gods your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project For what alas can these my single arms What propugnation is in one mans valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite Yet I protest Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will Paris should neer retract what he hath done Nor faint in the pursuit PRIAM Paris you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights You have the honey still but these the gall So to be valiant is no praise at all PARIS Sir I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wipd off in honourable keeping her What treason were it to the ransackd queen Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms Theres not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamd Where Helen is the subject Then I say Well may we fight for her whom we know well The worlds large spaces cannot parallel HECTOR Paris and Troilus you have both said well And on the cause and question now in hand Have glozd but superficially not much Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distempred blood Than to make up a free determination Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision Nature craves All dues be rendred to their owners Now What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection And that great minds of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills resist the same There is a law in each wellorderd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory If Helen then be wife to Spartas king As it is known she isthese moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back returnd Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong But makes it much more heavy Hectors opinion Is this in way of truth Yet neertheless My spritely brethren I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still For tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignities TROILUS Why there you touchd the life of our design Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector She is a theme of honour and renown A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds Whose present courage may beat down our foes And fame in time to come canonize us For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promisd glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide worlds revenue HECTOR I am yours You valiant offspring of great Priamus I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits I was advertisd their great general slept Whilst emulation in the army crept This I presume will wake him Exeunt SCENE III The Grecian camp Before the tent of Achilles Enter Thersites solus THERSITES How now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he raild at me Sfoot Ill learn to conjure and raise devils but Ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then theres Achilles a rare engineer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunderdarter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which shortarmd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan boneache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say Amen What ho my Lord Achilles Enter Patroclus PATROCLUS Whos there Thersites Good Thersites come in and rail THERSITES If I could a remembred a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slippd out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself The common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue Heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse Ill be sworn and sworn upont she never shrouded any but lazars Amen Wheres Achilles PATROCLUS What art thou devout Wast thou in prayer THERSITES Ay the heavens hear me PATROCLUS Amen Enter Achilles ACHILLES Whos there PATROCLUS Thersites my lord ACHILLES Where where O where Art thou come Why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals Come whats Agamemnon THERSITES Thy commander Achilles Then tell me Patroclus whats Achilles PATROCLUS Thy lord Thersites Then tell me I pray thee whats Thersites THERSITES Thy knower Patroclus Then tell me Patroclus what art thou PATROCLUS Thou must tell that knowest ACHILLES O tell tell THERSITES Ill decline the whole question Agamemnon commands Achilles Achilles is my lord I am Patroclus knower and Patroclus is a fool PATROCLUS You rascal THERSITES Peace fool I have not done ACHILLES He is a privilegd man Proceed Thersites THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool Achilles is a fool Thersites is a fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a fool ACHILLES Derive this come THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and this Patroclus is a fool positive PATROCLUS Why am I a fool THERSITES Make that demand of the Creator It suffices me thou art Look you who comes here Enter Agamemnon Ulysses Nestor Diomedes Ajax and Calchas ACHILLES Come Patroclus Ill speak with nobody Come in with me Thersites Exit THERSITES Here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery All the argument is a whore and a cuckolda good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon Now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all Exit AGAMEMNON Where is Achilles PATROCLUS Within his tent but illdisposd my lord AGAMEMNON Let it be known to him that we are here He shent our messengers and we lay by Our appertainings visiting of him Let him be told so lest perchance he think We dare not move the question of our place Or know not what we are PATROCLUS I shall say so to him Exit ULYSSES We saw him at the opening of his tent He is not sick AJAX Yes lionsick sick of proud heart You may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head tis pride But why why Let him show us a cause A word my lord Takes Agamemnon aside NESTOR What moves Ajax thus to bay at him ULYSSES Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him NESTOR Who Thersites ULYSSES He NESTOR Then will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument ULYSSES No you see he is his argument that has his argument Achilles NESTOR All the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite ULYSSES The amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie Reenter Patroclus Here comes Patroclus NESTOR No Achilles with him ULYSSES The elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure PATROCLUS Achilles bids me say he is much sorry If any thing more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state To call upon him he hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake An afterdinners breath AGAMEMNON Hear you Patroclus We are too well acquainted with these answers But his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn Cannot outfly our apprehensions Much attribute he hath and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues Not virtuously on his own part beheld Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him We come to speak with him and you shall not sin If you do say we think him overproud And underhonest in selfassumption greater Than in the note of judgement and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on Disguise the holy strength of their command And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance yea watch His course and time his ebbs and flows as if The passage and whole stream of this commencement Rode on his tide Go tell him this and add That if he overhold his price so much Well none of him but let him like an engine Not portable lie under this report Bring action hither this cannot go to war A stirring dwarf we do allowance give Before a sleeping giant Tell him so PATROCLUS I shall and bring his answer presentlyExit AGAMEMNON In second voice well not be satisfied We come to speak with him Ulysses enter you Exit Ulysses AJAX What is he more than another AGAMEMNON No more than what he thinks he is AJAX Is he so much Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am AGAMEMNON No question AJAX Will you subscribe his thought and say he is AGAMEMNON No noble Ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable AJAX Why should a man be proud How doth pride grow I know not what pride is AGAMEMNON Your mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the fairer He that is proud eats up himself Pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and

inquiry Of his behaviour REYNALDO My lord I did intend it POLONIUS Marry well said very well said Look you sir Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris And how and who what means and where they keep What company at what expense and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it Take you as twere some distant knowledge of him As thus I know his father and his friends And in part himdo you mark this Reynaldo REYNALDO Ay very well my lord POLONIUS And in part him but you may say not well But ift

companions noted and most known To youth and liberty REYNALDO As gaming my lord POLONIUS Ay or drinking fencing swearing Quarrelling drabbing You may go so far REYNALDO My lord that would dishonour him POLONIUS Faith no as you may season it in the charge You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency Thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind A savageness in unreclaimed blood Of general assault REYNALDO But my good lord POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this REYNALDO Ay my lord I would know that POLONIUS Marry sir heres my drift And I believe it is a fetch of warrant You laying these slight sullies on my son As twere a thing a little soild i th working Mark you Your

affrighted POLONIUS With what in the name of God OPHELIA My lord as I was sewing in my chamber Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbracd No hat upon his head his stockings fould Ungartred and downgyved to his ankle Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me POLONIUS Mad for thy love OPHELIA My lord I do not know but truly I do fear it POLONIUS What said he OPHELIA He took me by the wrist and held me hard Then goes he to the length of all his arm And with his other hand thus oer his brow He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it Long stayd he so At lasta little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down He raisd a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being That done he lets me go And with his head over his shoulder turnd He seemd to find his way without his eyes For out o doors he went without their help And to the last bended their light on me POLONIUS Come go with me I will go seek the King This is the very ecstasy of loveWhose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures I am sorry What have you given him any hard words of late OPHELIA No my good lord but as you did command I did repel his letters and denied His access to me POLONIUS That hath made him mad I am sorry that with better heed and judgement I had not quoted him I feard he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee But beshrew my jealousy It seems it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion Come go we to the King This must be known which being kept close might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love Exeunt SCENE II A room in the Castle Enter King Queen Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Attendants KING Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Moreover that we much did long to see you The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending Something have you heard Of Hamlets transformation so I call it Since nor thexterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was What it should be More than his fathers death that thus hath put him So much from thunderstanding of himself I cannot dream of I entreat you both That being of so young days brought up with him And since so neighbourd to his youth and humour That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That opend lies within our remedy QUEEN Good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a kings remembrance ROSENCRANTZ Both your majesties Might by the sovereign power you have of us Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty GUILDENSTERN We both obey And here give up ourselves in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded KING Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern QUEEN Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son Go some of you And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is GUILDENSTERN Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him QUEEN Ay amen Exeunt Rosencrantz Guildenstern and some Attendants Enter Polonius POLONIUS Thambassadors from Norway my good lord Are joyfully returnd KING Thou still hast been the father of good news POLONIUS Have I my lord Assure you my good liege I hold my duty as I hold my soul Both to my God and to my gracious King And I do thinkor else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath usd to dothat I have found The very cause of Hamlets lunacy KING O speak of that that do I long to hear POLONIUS Give first admittance to thambassadors My news shall be the fruit to that great feast KING Thyself do grace to them and bring them in Exit Polonius He tells me my sweet queen that he hath found The head and source of all your sons distemper QUEEN I doubt it is no other but the main His fathers death and our oerhasty marriage KING Well we shall sift him Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius Welcome my good friends Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway VOLTEMAND Most fair return of greetings and desires Upon our first he sent out to suppress His nephews levies which to him appeard To be a preparation gainst the Polack But better lookd into he truly found It was against your Highness whereat grievd That so his sickness age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give thassay of arms against your Majesty Whereon old Norway overcome with joy Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before against the Polack With an entreaty herein further shown Gives a paper That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down KING It likes us well And at our more considerd time well read Answer and think upon this business Meantime we thank you for your welltook labour Go to your rest at night well feast together Most welcome home Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius POLONIUS This business is well ended My liege and madam to expostulate What majesty should be what duty is Why day is day night night and time is time Were nothing but to waste night day and time Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes I will be brief Your noble son is mad Mad call I it for to define true madness What ist but to be nothing else but mad But let that go QUEEN More matter with less art POLONIUS Madam I swear I use no art at all That he is mad tis true tis true tis pity And pity tis tis true A foolish figure But farewell it for I will use no art Mad let us grant him then And now remains That we find out the cause of this effect Or rather say the cause of this defect For this effect defective comes by cause Thus it remains and the remainder thus Perpend I have a daughterhave whilst she is mine Who in her duty and obedience mark Hath given me this Now gather and surmise Reads To the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified Ophelia Thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear Reads these in her excellent white bosom these c QUEEN Came this from Hamlet to her POLONIUS Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful Reads Doubt thou the stars are fire Doubt that the sun doth move Doubt truth to be a liar But never doubt I love O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not art to reckon my groans But that I love thee best O most best believe it Adieu Thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him HAMLET This in obedience hath my daughter showd me And more above hath his solicitings As they fell out by time by means and place All given to mine ear KING But how hath she receivd his love POLONIUS What do you think of me KING As of a man faithful and honourable POLONIUS I would fain prove so But what might you think When I had seen this hot love on the wing As I perceivd it I must tell you that Before my daughter told me what might you Or my dear Majesty your queen here think If I had playd the desk or tablebook Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb Or lookd upon this love with idle sight What might you think No I went round to work And my young mistress thus I did bespeak Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star This must not be And then I precepts gave her That she should lock herself from his resort Admit no messengers receive no tokens Which done she took the fruits of my advice And he repulseda short tale to make Fell into a sadness then into a fast Thence to a watch thence into a weakness Thence to a lightness and by this declension Into the madness wherein now he raves And all we wail for KING Do you think tis this QUEEN It may be very likely POLONIUS Hath there been such a time Id fain know that That I have positively said Tis so When it provd otherwise KING Not that I know POLONIUS Take this from this if this be otherwise Points to his head and shoulder If circumstances lead me I will find Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed Within the centre KING How may we try it further POLONIUS You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby QUEEN So he does indeed POLONIUS At such a time Ill loose my daughter to him Be you and I behind an arras then Mark the encounter If he love her not And be not from his reason falln thereon Let me be no assistant for a state But keep a farm and carters KING We will try it Enter Hamlet reading QUEEN But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading POLONIUS Away I do beseech you both away Ill board him presently O give me leave Exeunt King Queen and Attendants How does my good Lord Hamlet HAMLET Well Godamercy POLONIUS Do you know me my lord HAMLET Excellent well You are a fishmonger POLONIUS Not I my lord HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man POLONIUS Honest my lord HAMLET Ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand POLONIUS Thats very true my lord HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion Have you a daughter POLONIUS I have my lord HAMLET Let her not walk i th sun Conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive Friend look tot POLONIUS How say you by that Aside Still harping on my daughter Yet he knew me not at first he said I was a fishmonger He is far gone far gone And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love very near this Ill speak to him againWhat do you read my lord HAMLET Words words words POLONIUS What is the matter my lord HAMLET Between who POLONIUS I mean the matter that you read my lord HAMLET Slanders sir For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams All which sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down For you yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab you could go backward POLONIUS Aside Though this be madness yet there is method int Will you walk out of the air my lord HAMLET Into my grave POLONIUS Indeed that is out o the air Aside How pregnant sometimes his replies are A happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter My honourable lord I will most humbly take my leave of you HAMLET You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life POLONIUS Fare you well my lord HAMLET These tedious old fools Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern POLONIUS You go to seek the Lord Hamlet there he is ROSENCRANTZ To Polonius God save you sirExit Polonius GUILDENSTERN My honoured lord ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord HAMLET My excellent good friends How dost thou Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both ROSENCRANTZ As the indifferent children of the earth GUILDENSTERN Happy in that we are not overhappy On Fortunes cap we are not the very button HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe ROSENCRANTZ Neither my lord HAMLET Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours GUILDENSTERN Faith her privates we HAMLET In the secret parts of Fortune O most true she is a strumpet Whats the news ROSENCRANTZ None my lord but that the worlds grown honest HAMLET Then is doomsday near But your news is not true Let me question more in particular What have you my good friends deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither GUILDENSTERN Prison my lord HAMLET Denmarks a prison ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one HAMLET A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one o th worst ROSENCRANTZ We think not so my lord HAMLET Why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so To me it is a prison ROSENCRANTZ Why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind HAMLET O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams GUILDENSTERN Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow ROSENCRANTZ Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretchd heroes the beggars shadows Shall we to th court For by my fay I cannot reason ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN Well wait upon you HAMLET No such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully attended But in the beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore ROSENCRANTZ To visit you my lord no other occasion HAMLET Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you And sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come deal justly with me Come come nay speak GUILDENSTERN What should we say my lord HAMLET Why anything But to the purpose You were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour I know the good King and Queen have sent for you ROSENCRANTZ To what end my lord HAMLET That you must teach me But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no ROSENCRANTZ To Guildenstern What say you HAMLET Aside Nay then I have an eye of you If you love me hold not off GUILDENSTERN My lord we were sent for HAMLET I will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours What a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust Man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so ROSENCRANTZ My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts HAMLET Why did you laugh then when I said Man delights not me ROSENCRANTZ To think my lord if you delight not in man what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you We coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcomehis Majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort What players are they ROSENCRANTZ Even those you were wont to take such delight inthe tragedians of the city HAMLET How chances it they travel Their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways ROSENCRANTZ I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city Are they so followed ROSENCRANTZ No indeed they are not HAMLET How comes it Do they grow rusty ROSENCRANTZ Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aerie of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort These are now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither HAMLET What are they children Who maintains em How are they escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common playersas it is most like if their means are no bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ROSENCRANTZ Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy There was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question HAMLET Ist possible GUILDENSTERN O there has been much throwing about of brains HAMLET Do the boys carry it away ROSENCRANTZ Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too HAMLET It is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out Flourish of trumpets within GUILDENSTERN There are the players HAMLET Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands come The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony Let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours You are welcome But my unclefather and auntmother are deceived GUILDENSTERN In what my dear lord HAMLET I am but mad northnorthwest When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw Enter Polonius POLONIUS Well be with you gentlemen HAMLET Hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts ROSENCRANTZ Happily hes the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child HAMLET I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players Mark itYou say right sir for a Monday morning twas so indeed POLONIUS My lord I have news to tell you HAMLET My lord I have news to tell you When Roscius was an actor in Rome POLONIUS The actors are come hither my lord HAMLET Buzz buzz POLONIUS Upon my honour HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass POLONIUS The best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral tragicalhistorical tragicalcomicalhistoricalpastoral scene individable or poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty These are the only men HAMLET O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou POLONIUS What treasure had he my lord HAMLET Why One fair daughter and no more The which he loved passing well POLONIUS Aside Still on my daughter HAMLET Am I not i th right old Jephthah POLONIUS If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing well HAMLET Nay that follows not POLONIUS What follows then my lord HAMLET Why As by lot God wot and then you know It came to pass as most like it was The first row of the pious chanson will show you more For look where my abridgement comes Enter four or five Players You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad to see thee well Welcome good friends O my old friend Thy face is valancd since I saw thee last Comst thou to beard me in Denmark What my young lady and mistress Byr lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring Masters you are all welcome Well een tot like French falconers fly at anything we see Well have a speech straight Come give us a taste of your quality Come a passionate speech FIRST PLAYER What speech my lord HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play I remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general But it wasas I received it and others whose judgements in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine One speech in it I chiefly loved Twas Aeneas tale to Dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priams slaughter If it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see The rugged Pyrrhus like th Hyrcanian beast It is not so it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms Black as his purpose did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse Hath now this dread and black complexion smeard With heraldry more dismal Head to foot Now is he total gules horridly trickd With blood of fathers mothers daughters sonsBakd and impasted with the parching streets That lend a tyrannous and a damned light To their vile murders Roasted in wrath and fire And thus oersized with coagulate gore With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks So proceed you POLONIUS Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion FIRST PLAYER Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks His antique sword Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls Repugnant to command Unequal matchd Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword Thunnerved father falls Then senseless Ilium Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear For lo his sword Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam seemd i thair to stick So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood And like a neutral to his will and matter Did nothing But as we often see against some storm A silence in the heavens the rack stand still The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus pause Aroused vengeance sets him new awork And never did the Cyclops hammers fall On Marss armour forgd for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falls on Priam Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods In general synod take away her power Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven As low as to the fiends POLONIUS This is too long HAMLET It shall to the barbers with your beardPrithee say on Hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps Say on come to Hecuba FIRST PLAYER But who O who had seen the mobled queen HAMLET The mobled queen POLONIUS Thats good Mobled queen is good FIRST PLAYER Run barefoot up and down threatning the flames With bisson rheum A clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood and for a robe About her lank and all oerteemed loins A blanket in thalarm of fear caught up Who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd Gainst Fortunes state would treason have pronouncd But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husbands limbs The instant burst of clamour that she made Unless things mortal move them not at all Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven And passion in the gods POLONIUS Look where he has not turnd his colour and has tears ins eyes Pray you no more HAMLET Tis well Ill have thee speak out the rest of this soonGood my lord will you see the players well bestowed Do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live POLONIUS My lord I will use them according to their desert HAMLET Gods bodikin man much better Use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping Use them after your

Is it not monstrous that this player here But in a fiction in a dream of passion Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wand Tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect A broken voice and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit And all for nothing For Hecuba Whats Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech Make mad the guilty and appal the free Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I A dull and muddymettled rascal peak Like Johnadreams unpregnant of my cause And can say nothing No not for a king Upon whose property and most dear

very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaimd their malefactions For murder though it have no tongue will speak With most miraculous organ Ill have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle Ill observe his looks Ill tent him to the quick If he but blench I know my course The spirit that I have seen May be the devil and the devil hath power Tassume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy As he is very potent with such spirits Abuses me to damn me Ill have grounds More relative than this

Did he receive you well ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman GUILDENSTERN But with much forcing of his disposition ROSENCRANTZ Niggard of question but of our demands Most free in his reply QUEEN Did you assay him to any pastime ROSENCRANTZ Madam it so fell out that certain players We oerraught on the way Of these we told him And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it They are about the

house Who gave his blood to lime the stones together And set up Lancaster Why trowest thou Warwick That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural To bend the fatal instruments of war Against his brother and his lawful King Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath To keep that oath were more impiety Than Jephthahs when he sacrificed his daughter I am so sorry for my trespass made That to deserve well at my brothers hands I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe With resolution wheresoer I meet thee As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad To plague thee for thy foul misleading me And so proudhearted

whose shade the ramping lion slept Whose top branch overpeered Joves spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winters powrful wind These eyes that now are dimmed with deaths black veil Have been as piercing as the midday sun To search the secret treasons of the world The wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood Were likened oft to kingly sepulchres For who lived King but I could dig his grave

be a clipper Exeunt soldiers Upon the King Let us our lives our souls Our debts our careful wives Our children and our sins lay on the King We must bear all O hard condition Twinborn with greatness subject to the breath Of every fool whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing What infinite hearts ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy And what have kings that privates have not too Save ceremony save general ceremony And what art thou thou idol Ceremony What kind of god art thou that sufferst more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers What are thy rents What are thy comings in O Ceremony show me but thy worth What is thy soul of adoration Art thou aught else but place degree and form Creating awe and fear in other men Wherein thou art less happy being feard Than they in fearing What drinkst thou oft instead of homage sweet But poisond flattery O be sick great greatness And bid thy Ceremony give thee cure Thinkst thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation Will it give place to flexure and low bending Canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee Command the health of it No thou proud dream That playst so subtly with a kings repose I am a king that find thee and I know Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball The sword the mace the crown imperial The intertissued robe of gold and pearl The farced title running fore the King The throne

Who with a body filld and vacant mind Gets him to rest crammd with distressful bread Never sees horrid night the child of hell But like a lackey from the rise to set Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse And follows so the everrunning year With profitable labour to his grave And but for ceremony such a wretch

have a feeling and these stones Prove armed soldiers ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellions arms CARLISLE Fear not my lord That Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all The means that heaven yields must be embraced And not neglected else if heaven would And we will not Heavens offer we refuse The proffered means of succour and redress AUMERLE He means my lord that we are too remiss Whilst Bolingbroke through our security Grows strong and great in substance and in power KING RICHARD Discomfortable cousin knowst thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid Behind the globe that lights the lower world Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage boldly here But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole Then murders treasons and detested sins The cloak of night being plucked from off their backs Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke Who all this while hath revelled in the night Whilst we were wandring with the Antipodes Shall see us rising in our throne the east His treasons will sit blushing in his face Not able to endure the sight of day But selfaffrighted tremble at his sin Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy elected by the Lord For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel Then if angels fight Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right Enter Salisbury Welcome my lord How far off lies your power SALISBURY Nor near nor farther off my

cannot mend They break their faith to God as well as us Cry woe destruction ruin loss decay The worst is death and death will have his day SCROOP Glad am I that your highness is so armed To bear the tidings of calamity Like an unseasonable stormy day Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores As if the world were all dissolved to tears So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty boys with womens voices Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of doublefatal yew against thy state Yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills Against thy seat Both young and old rebel And all goes worse than I have power to tell KING RICHARD Too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot What is become of Bushy Where is Green That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps If we prevail their heads shall pay for it I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke SCROOP

Judases each one thrice worse than Judas Would they make peace Terrible hell Make war upon their spotted souls for this SCROOP Sweet love I see changing his property Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate Again uncurse their souls Their peace is made With heads and not with hands Those whom you curse Have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound And lie full low graved in the hollow ground AUMERLE Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead SCROOP Ay all of them at Bristol lost their heads AUMERLE Where is the Duke my father with his power KING RICHARD No matter where Of comfort no

we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbrokes And nothing can we call our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones For Gods sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings How some have been deposed some slain in war Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed Some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed All murdered For within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp Allowing him a breath a little scene To monarchize be feared and kill with looks Infusing him with self and vain conceit As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass impregnable and humoured thus Comes at the last and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall and farewell king Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence Throw away respect Tradition form and ceremonious duty For you have but mistook me all this while I live with bread like you feel want Taste grief need friends Subjected thus How can you say to me I am a king CARLISLE My lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes But presently prevent the ways to wail To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe And so your follies fight against yourself Fear and be slainno worse can come to fight And fight and die is death destroying death Where fearing dying pays death servile breath AUMERLE My father hath a power Enquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb KING RICHARD Thou chidst me well Proud Bolingbroke I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom This ague fit of fear is overblown An easy task it is to win our ownSay Scroop where lies our uncle with his power Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour SCROOP Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state in inclination of the day So may you by my dull and heavy eye My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke And all your northern castles yielded up And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party KING RICHARD Thou hast said enough To Aumerle Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair What say you now What comfort have we now By heaven Ill hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more Go to Flint Castle There Ill pine away A king

Bushy Green SERVANT What are they dead GARDENER They are And Bolingbroke Hath seized the wasteful King O what pity is it That he had not so trimmed and dressed his land As we this garden We at time of

Gloucestershire Enter Bolingbroke and Northumberland with Forces BOLINGBROKE How far is it my lord to Berkeley now NORTHUMBERLAND Believe me noble lord I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire These high wild hills and rough uneven ways Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar Making the hard way sweet and delectable But I bethink me what a weary way From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company Which I protest hath very much beguiled The tediousness and process of my travel But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoyed By this the weary lords Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done By sight of what I have your noble company BOLINGBROKE Of much less value is my company Than your good words But who comes here Enter Harry Percy NORTHUMBERLAND It is my son young Harry Percy Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever Harry how fares your uncle PERCY I had thought my lord to have learned his health of you NORTHUMBERLAND Why is he not with the Queen PERCY No my good lord He hath forsook the court Broken his staff of office and dispersed The household of the King NORTHUMBERLAND What was his reason He was not so resolved when last we spake together PERCY Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh NORTHUMBERLAND Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy PERCY No my good lord for that is not forgot Which neer I did remember To my knowledge I never in my life did look on him NORTHUMBERLAND Then learn to know him now This is the Duke PERCY My gracious lord I tender you my service Such as it is being tender raw and young Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desert BOLINGBROKE I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul remembring my good friends And as my fortune ripens with thy love It shall be still thy true loves recompense My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it NORTHUMBERLAND How far is it to Berkeley and what stir Keeps good old York there with his

Here comes his Grace in person My noble uncle Kneels YORK Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee Whose duty is deceivable and false BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle YORK Tut tut Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle I am no traitors uncle and that word grace In an ungracious mouth is but profane Why have those banished and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of Englands ground But then more why why have they dared to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom Frighting her palefaced villages with war And ostentation of despised arms Comst thou because the anointed king is hence Why foolish boy the King is left behind And in my loyal bosom lies his power Were I but now lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men From forth the ranks of many thousand French O then how quickly should this arm of mine Now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee And minister correction to thy fault BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle let me know my fault On what condition stands it and wherein YORK Even in condition of the worst degree In gross rebellion and detested treason Thou art a banished man and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereign BOLINGBROKE As I was banished I was banished Hereford But as I come I come for Lancaster And noble uncle I beseech your Grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye You are my father for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O then my father Will you permit that I shall stand condemned A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties Plucked from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born If that my cousin king be King in England It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin Had you first died and he been thus trod down He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay I am denied to sue my livery here And yet my letters patents give me leave My fathers goods are all distrained and sold And these and all are all amiss employed What would you have me do I am a subject And challenge law Attorneys are denied me And therefore personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descent NORTHUMBERLAND The noble Duke hath been too much abused ROSS It stands your Grace upon to do him right WILLOUGHBY Base men by his endowments are made great YORK My lords of England let me tell you this I have had feeling of my cousins wrongs And laboured all I could to do him right But in this kind to come in braving arms Be his own carver and cut out his way To find out right with wrong it may not be And you that do abet him in this kind Cherish rebellion and are rebels all NORTHUMBERLAND The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is But for his own and for the right of that We all have strongly sworn to give him aid And let him never see joy that breaks that oath YORK Well well I see the issue of these arms I cannot mend it I must needs confess Because my power is weak and all illleft But if I could by Him that gave me life I would attach you all and make you stoop Unto the sovereign mercy of the King But since I cannot be it known unto you I do remain as neuter So fare you well Unless you please to enter in the castle And there repose you for this night BOLINGBROKE An offer uncle that we will accept But we must win your Grace to go with us To Bristol Castle which they say is held By Bushy Bagot and their complices The caterpillars of the commonwealth Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away YORK It may be I will go with you but yet Ill pause For I am loath to break our countrys laws Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are Things past redress are now with me past care Exeunt SCENE IV A camp in Wales Enter Earl of Salisbury and a Welsh Captain CAPTAIN My Lord of Salisbury we have stayed ten days And hardly kept our countrymen together And yet we hear no tidings from the King Therefore we will disperse ourselves Farewell SALISBURY Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman The King reposeth all his confidence in thee CAPTAIN Tis thought the King is dead We will not stay The bay trees in our country are all withered And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven The palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth And leanlooked prophets whisper fearful change Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap The one in fear to lose what they enjoy The other to enjoy by rage and war These signs forerun the death or fall of kings Farewell Our countrymen are gone and fled As well assured Richard their king is dead Exit SALISBURY Ah Richard With the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes And crossly to thy good all fortune goes Exit ACT III SCENE I Bristol Bolingbrokes camp Enter Bolingbroke York Northumberland Harry Percy Willoughby Ross Officers behind with Bushy and Green prisoners BOLINGBROKE Bring forth these men Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls Since presently your souls must part your bodies With too much urging your pernicious livesFor twere no charity yet to wash your blood From off my hands here in the view of men I will unfold some causes of your deaths You have misled a prince a royal king A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments By you unhappied and disfigured clean You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him Broke the possession of a royal bed And stained the beauty of a fair queens cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs Myself a prince by fortune of my birth Near to the King in blood and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me Have stooped my neck under your injuries And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds Eating the bitter bread of banishment Whilst you have fed upon my signories Disparked my parks and felled my forest woods From my own windows torn my household coat Rased out my imprese leaving me no sign Save mens opinions and my living blood To show the world I am a gentleman This and much more much more than twice all this Condemns you to the death See them delivered over To execution and the hand of death BUSHY More welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewell GREEN My comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hell BOLINGBROKE My Lord Northumberland see them dispatched Exeunt Northumberland and Others with Bushy and Green Uncle you say the Queen is at your house For Gods sake fairly let her be entreated Tell her I send to her my kind commends Take special care my

while to work and after holiday Exeunt SCENE II The coast of Wales A castle in view Flourish drums and trumpets Enter King Richard the Bishop of Carlisle Aumerle and soldiers KING RICHARD Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand AUMERLE Yea my lord How brooks your Grace the air After your late tossing on the breaking seas KING RICHARD Needs must I like it well I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand Though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs As a longparted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting So weepingsmiling greet I thee my earth And do thee favours with my royal hands Feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom And heavygaited toads lie in their way Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet Which with usurping steps do trample thee Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch Throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies Mock not my senseless conjuration lords This earth shall have a feeling and these stones Prove armed soldiers ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellions arms CARLISLE Fear not my lord That Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all The means that heaven yields must be embraced And not neglected else if heaven would And we will not Heavens offer we refuse The proffered means of succour and redress AUMERLE He means my lord that we are too remiss Whilst Bolingbroke through our security Grows strong and great in substance and in power KING RICHARD Discomfortable cousin knowst thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid Behind the globe that lights the lower world Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage boldly here But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole Then murders treasons and detested sins The cloak of night being plucked from off their backs Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke Who all this while hath revelled in the night Whilst we were wandring with the Antipodes Shall see us rising in our throne the east His treasons will sit blushing in his face Not able to endure the sight of day But selfaffrighted tremble at his sin Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy elected by the Lord For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel Then if angels fight Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right Enter Salisbury Welcome my lord How far off lies your power SALISBURY Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord Than this weak arm Discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair One day too late I fear me noble lord Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth O call back yesterday bid time return And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men Today today unhappy day too late Oerthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead Are gone to Bolingbroke dispersed and fled AUMERLE Comfort my liege Why looks your Grace so pale KING RICHARD But now the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face and they are fled And till so much blood thither come again Have I not reason to look pale and dead All souls that will be safe fly from my side For time hath set a blot upon my pride AUMERLE Comfort my liege Remember who you are KING RICHARD I had forgot myself Am I not king Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest Is not the Kings name twenty thousand names Arm arm my name A puny subject strikes At thy great glory Look not to the ground Ye favourites of a king Are we not high High be our thoughts I know my uncle York Hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here Enter Sir Stephen Scroop SCROOP More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my caretuned tongue deliver him KING RICHARD Mine ear is open and my heart prepared The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold Say is my kingdom lost Why twas my care And what loss is it to be rid of care Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we Greater he shall not be If he serve God Well serve Him too and be his fellow so Revolt our subjects That we cannot mend They break their faith to God as well as us Cry woe destruction ruin loss decay The worst is death and death will have his day SCROOP Glad am I that your highness is so armed To bear the tidings of calamity Like an unseasonable stormy day Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores As if the world were all dissolved to tears So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty boys with womens voices Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of doublefatal yew against thy state Yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills Against thy seat Both young and old rebel And all goes worse than I have power to tell KING RICHARD Too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot What is become of Bushy Where is Green That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps If we prevail their heads shall pay for it I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke SCROOP Peace have they made with him indeed my lord KING RICHARD O villains vipers damned without redemption Dogs easily won to fawn on any man Snakes in my heartblood warmed that sting my heart Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas Would they make peace Terrible hell Make war upon their spotted souls for this SCROOP Sweet love I see changing his property Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate Again uncurse their souls Their peace is made With heads and not with hands Those whom you curse Have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound And lie full low graved in the hollow ground AUMERLE Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead SCROOP Ay all of them at Bristol lost their heads AUMERLE Where is the Duke my father with his power KING RICHARD No matter where Of comfort no man speak Lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth Lets choose executors and talk of wills And yet not so for what can we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbrokes And nothing can we call our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones For Gods sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings How some have been deposed some slain in war Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed Some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed All murdered For within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp Allowing him a breath a little scene To monarchize be feared and kill with looks Infusing him with self and vain conceit As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass impregnable and humoured thus Comes at the last and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall and farewell king Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence Throw away respect Tradition form and ceremonious duty For you have but mistook me all this while I live with bread like you feel want Taste grief need friends Subjected thus How can you say to me I am a king CARLISLE My lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes But presently prevent the ways to wail To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe And so your follies fight against yourself Fear and be slainno worse can come to fight And fight and die is death destroying death Where fearing dying pays death servile breath AUMERLE My father hath a power Enquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb KING RICHARD Thou chidst me well Proud Bolingbroke I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom This ague fit of fear is overblown An easy task it is to win our ownSay Scroop where lies our uncle with his power Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour SCROOP Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state in inclination of the day So may you by my dull and heavy eye My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke And all your northern castles yielded up And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party KING RICHARD Thou hast said enough To Aumerle Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair What say you now What comfort have we now By heaven Ill hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more Go to Flint Castle There Ill pine away A king woes slave shall kingly woe obey That power I have discharge and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow For I have none Let no man speak again To alter this for counsel is but vain AUMERLE My liege one word KING RICHARD He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue Discharge my followers Let them hence away From Richards night to Bolingbrokes fair day

sentence PERICLES Great king Few love to hear the sins they love to act Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it Who has a book of all that monarchs do Hes more secure to keep it shut than shown For vice repeated is like the wandering wind Blows dust in others eyes to spread itself And yet the end of all is bought thus dear The breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear To stop the air would hurt them The blind mole casts Coppd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throngd By mans oppression and the poor worm doth die fort Kind are earths gods in vice their laws their will And

We might proceed to cancel of your days Yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree As your fair self doth tune us otherwise Forty days longer we do respite you If by which time our secret be undone This

done is like an hypocrite The which is good in nothing but in sight If it be true that I interpret false Then were it certain you were not so bad As with foul incest to abuse your soul Where now youre both a father and a son By your untimely claspings with your child Which pleasures fits a husband not a father And she an eater of her mothers flesh By the defiling of her parents bed And both like serpents are who though they feed On sweetest flowers yet they poison breed Antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men Blush not in actions blacker than the night Will schew no course to keep them from the light One sin I know another doth provoke Murders as near to lust as flame to smoke Poison and treason are the hands of sin Ay and the targets to put off the shame Then lest my life be croppd

spirits Nor yet the others distance comfort me Then it is thus the passions of the mind That have their first conception by misdread Have afternourishment and life by care And what was first but fear what might be done Grows elder now and cares it be not done And so with me the great Antiochus Gainst whom I am too little to contend Since hes so great can make his will his act Will think me

like a physician Helicanus That ministers a potion unto me That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself Attend me then I went to Antioch Where as thou knowst against the face of death I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty From whence an issue I might propagate Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder The resthark in thine earas black as incest Which by my knowledge found the sinful father Seemd not to strike but smooth but thou knowst this Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss Which fear so grew in me I hither fled Under the covering of a careful night Who seemd my good protector and being here Bethought me what was past what might succeed I knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears Decrease not but grow faster than the years

Exeunt SCENE IV Tarsus A room in the Governors houseEnter Cleon the governor of Tarsus with Dionyza and others CLEON My Dionyza shall we rest us here And by relating tales of others griefs See if twill teach us to forget our own DIONYZA That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it For who digs hills because they do aspire Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher O my distressed lord even such our griefs are Here theyre but felt and seen with mischiefs eyes But like to groves being toppd they higher rise CLEON O Dionyza Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it Or can conceal his hunger till he famish Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep Our woes into the air our eyes do weep Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder That if heaven slumber while their creatures want They may awake their helps to comfort them Ill then discourse our woes felt several years And wanting breath to speak help me with tears DIONYZA Ill do my best sir CLEON This Tarsus oer which I have the government A city on whom plenty held full hand For riches strewd herself even in the streets Whose towers bore heads so high they kissd the clouds And strangers neer beheld but wonderd at Whose men and dames so jetted and adornd Like one anothers glass to trim them by Their tables were stored full to glad the sight And not so much to feed on as delight All poverty was scornd and pride so great The name of help grew odious to repeat DIONYZA O tis too true CLEON But see what heaven can do By this our change These mouths who but of late earth sea and air Were all too little to content and please Although they gave their creatures in abundance As houses are defiled for want of use They are now starved for want of exercise Those palates who not yet two summers younger Must have inventions to delight the taste Would now be glad of bread and beg for it Those mothers who to nousle up their babes Thought nought too curious are ready now To eat those little darlings whom they loved So sharp are hungers teeth that man and wife Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping Here many sink yet those which see them fall Have scarce

superflous riots hear these tears The misery of Tarsus may be theirs Enter a Lord LORD Wheres the lord governor CLEON Here Speak out thy sorrows which thou bringst in haste For comfort is too far for us to expect LORD We have descried upon our neighbouring shore A portly sail of ships make hitherward CLEON I thought as much One sorrow never comes but brings an heir That may succeed as his inheritor And so in ours some neighbouring nation Taking advantage of our misery That stuffd the hollow vessels with their power To beat us down the which are down already And make a conquest of unhappy me Whereas no glorys got to overcome LORD Thats the least fear for by the semblance Of their white flags displayd they bring us peace And come to us as favourers not as foes CLEON Thou speakst like hims untutord to repeat Who makes the fairest show means most deceit But bring they what they will and what they can What need we fear The grounds the lowest and we are half way there Go tell their general we attend him here To know for what he comes and whence he comes And what he craves LORD I go my lord Exit CLEON Welcome is peace if he on peace consist If wars we are unable to resist Enter Pericles with Attendants PERICLES Lord governor for so we hear you are Let not our ships and number of our men Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes We have heard your miseries as far as

stuffd within With bloody veins expecting overthrow Are stored with corn to make your needy bread And give them life whom hunger starved half dead ALL The gods of Greece protect you And well pray for you PERICLES Arise I pray you rise We do not look for reverence but for love And harbourage for ourself our ships and men CLEON The which when any shall not gratify Or pay you with unthankfulness in

welcome well accept feast here awhile Until our stars that frown lend us a smile Exeunt ACT II Enter Gower GOWER Here have you seen a mighty king His child iwis to incest bring A better prince and

gentleman almost forspent with speed That stoppd by me to breathe his bloodied horse He askd the way to Chester and of him I did demand what news from Shrewsbury He told me that rebellion had bad luck And that young Harry Percys spur was cold With that he gave his able horse the head And bending forward struck his armed heels Against the panting sides of his poor jade Up to the rowelhead and starting so He seemd in running to devour the way Staying no longer question NORTHUMBERLAND Ha Again Said he young Harry Percys spur was cold Of Hotspur Coldspur That rebellion Had met ill luck LORD BARDOLPH My lord Ill tell you what If my young lord your son have not the day Upon mine honour for a silken point Ill give my barony never talk of it NORTHUMBERLAND Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of loss LORD BARDOLPH Who he He was some hilding fellow that had stolen The horse he rode on and upon my life Spoke at a venture Look here comes more news Enter Morton NORTHUMBERLAND Yea this mans brow like to a titleleaf Foretells the nature of a tragic volume So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witnessd usurpation Say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury MORTON I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask To fright our party NORTHUMBERLAND How doth my son and brother Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand Even such a man so faint so spiritless So dull so dread in look so woebegone Drew Priams curtain in the dead of night And would have told him half his Troy was burnt But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue And I my Percys death ere thou reportst it This thou wouldst say Your son did thus and thus Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds But in the end to stop my ear indeed Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise Ending with Brother son and all are dead MORTON Douglas is living and your brother yet But for my lord your son NORTHUMBERLAND Why he is dead See what a ready tongue suspicion hath He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes That what he feard is chanced Yet speak Morton Tell thou an earl his divination lies And I will take it as a sweet disgrace And make thee rich for doing me such wrong MORTON You are too great to be by me gainsaid Your spirit is too true your fears too certain NORTHUMBERLAND Yet for all this say not that Percys dead I see a strange confession in thine eye Thou shakest thy head and holdst it fear or sin To speak a truth If he be slain say so The tongue offends not that reports his death And he doth sin that doth belie the dead Not he which says the dead is not alive Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell Rememberd tolling a departing friend LORD BARDOLPH I cannot think my lord your son is dead MORTON I am sorry I should force you to believe That which I would to God I had not seen But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state Rendring faint quittance wearied and outbreathed To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down The neverdaunted Percy to the earth From whence with life he never more sprung up In few his death whose spirit lent a fire Even to the dullest peasant in his camp Being bruited once took fire and heat away From the besttemperd courage in his troops For from his metal was his party steeld Which once in him abated all the rest Turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead And as the thing thats heavy in itself Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed So did our men heavy in Hotspurs loss Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester Too soon taen prisoner and that furious Scot The bloody Douglas whose welllabouring sword Had three times slain th appearance of the King Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame Of those that turnd their backs and in his flight Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all Is that the King hath won and hath sent out A speedy power to encounter you my lord Under the conduct of young Lancaster And Westmoreland This is the news at full NORTHUMBERLAND For this I shall have time enough to mourn In poison there is physic and these news Having been well that would have made me sick Being sick have in some measure made me well And as the wretch whose feverweakend joints Like strengthless hinges buckle under life Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire Out of his keepers arms even so my limbs Weakend with grief being now enraged with grief Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel Must glove this hand And hence thou sickly coif Thou art a guard too wanton for the head Which princes fleshd with conquest aim to hit Now bind my brows with iron and approach The raggedst hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon th enraged Northumberland Let heaven kiss earth Now let not Natures hand Keep the wild flood confined Let order die And let this world no longer be a stage To feed contention in a lingering act But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set On bloody courses the rude scene may end And darkness be the burier of the dead LORD BARDOLPH This strained passion doth you wrong my lord MORTON Sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour The lives of all your loving complices Lean on your health the which if you give oer To stormy passion must perforce decay You cast th event of war my noble lord And summd the account of chance before you said Let us make head It was your presurmise That in the dole of blows your son might drop You knew he walkd oer perils on an edge More likely to fall in than to get oer You were advised his flesh was capable Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged Yet did you say Go forth and none of this Though strongly apprehended could restrain The stiffborne action What hath then befalln Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forthMore than that being which was like to be LORD BARDOLPH We all that are engaged to this loss Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life twas ten to one And yet we ventured for the gain proposed Choked the respect of likely peril feard And since we are oerset venture again Come we will put forth body and goods MORTON Tis more than time And my most noble lord I hear for certain and dare speak the truth The gentle Archbishop of York is up With wellappointed powers He is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers My lord your son had only but the corpse But shadows and the shows of men to fight For that same word rebellion did divide The action of their bodies from their souls And they did fight with queasiness constraind As men drink potions that their weapons only Seemd on our side but for their spirits and souls This word rebellion it had froze them up As fish are in a pond But now the bishop Turns insurrection to religion Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts Hes followd both with body and with mind And doth enlarge his rising with the blood Of fair King Richard scraped from Pomfret stones Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke And more and less do flock to follow him NORTHUMBERLAND I knew of this before but to speak truth This present grief had wiped it from my mind Go in with me and counsel every man The aptest way for safety and revenge Get posts and letters and make friends with speed Never so few and never yet more need Exeunt SCENE II London A street Enter Falstaff with his Page bearing his sword and buckler FALSTAFF Sirrah you giant

but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewelthe juvenal the Prince your master whose chin is not yet fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a faceroyal God may finish it when He will tis not a hair amiss yet He may keep it still at a faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it And yet hell be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor He may keep his own grace but hes almost out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops PAGE He said sir you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph He would not take his band and yours he liked not the security FALSTAFF Let him be damned like the glutton Pray God his tongue be hotter A whoreson Achitophel A rascally yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The whoreson smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security I looked he should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me security Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him Wheres Bardolph PAGE Hes gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a

make it SERVANT You mistake me sir FALSTAFF Why sir did I say you were an honest man Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I had said so SERVANT I pray you sir then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man FALSTAFF I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside

the disease for you hear not what I say to you FALSTAFF Very well my lord very well Rather an t please you it is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that I am troubled withal CHIEF JUSTICE To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears and I care not if I do become your physician FALSTAFF I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itself CHIEF JUSTICE I sent for you when there were matters against you for your life to come speak with me FALSTAFF As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this landservice I did not come CHIEF JUSTICE Well the truth is Sir John you live in great infamy FALSTAFF He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less CHIEF JUSTICE Your means are very slender and your waste is great FALSTAFF I

he that looks upon me will take me without weighing And yet in some respects I grant I cannot go I cannot tell Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers times that true valour is turned bearherd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings All the other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our youth I must confess are wags too CHIEF JUSTICE Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth that are written down old with all the characters of age Have you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an increasing belly Is not your voice broken your wind short your chin double your wit single and every part about you blasted with antiquity And will you yet call yourself young Fie fie fie Sir John FALSTAFF My lord I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a white head and something a round belly For my voice I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems To approve my youth further I will not The truth is I am only old in judgement and understanding and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him For the box of the ear

furnish me forth CHIEF JUSTICE Not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to bear crosses Fare you well commend me to my cousin Westmoreland Exeunt Chief Justice and Servant FALSTAFF If I do fillip

Archbishops palace Enter the Archbishop the Lords Hastings Mowbray and Bardolph ARCHBISHOP Thus have you heard our cause and known our means And my most noble friends I pray you all Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes And first Lord Marshal what say you to it MOWBRAY I well allow the occasion of our arms But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the King HASTINGS Our present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns With an incensed fire of injuries LORD BARDOLPH The question then Lord Hastings standeth thus Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland HASTINGS With him we may LORD BARDOLPH Yea marry theres the point But if without him we be thought too feeble My judgement is we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand For in a theme so bloodyfaced as this Conjecture expectation and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted ARCHBISHOP Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed It was young Hotspurs case at Shrewsbury LORD BARDOLPH It was my lord who lined himself with hope Eating the air on promise of supply Flattring himself in project of a power Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts And so with great imagination Proper to madmen led his powers to death And winking leapd into destruction HASTINGS But by your leave it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope LORD BARDOLPH Yes if this present quality of war Indeed the instant action a cause on foot Lives so in hope as in an early spring We see th appearing buds which to prove fruit Hope gives not so much warrant as despair That frosts will bite them When we mean to build We first survey the plot then draw the model And when we see the figure of the house Then we must rate the cost of the erection Which if we find outweighs ability What do we then but draw anew the model In fewer offices or at least desist To build at all Much more in this great work Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down And set another up should we survey The plot of situation and the model Consent upon a sure foundation Question surveyors know our own estate How able such a work to undergo To weigh against his opposite or else We fortify in paper and in figures Using the names of men instead of men Like one that draws the model of a house Beyond his power to build it who half through Gives oer and leaves his partcreated cost A naked subject to the weeping clouds And waste for churlish winters tyranny HASTINGS Grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth Should be stillborn and that we now possessd The utmost man of expectation I think we are a body strong enough Even as we are to equal with the King LORD BARDOLPH What is the King but five and twenty thousand HASTINGS To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph For his divisions as the times do brawl Are in three heads one power against the French And one against Glendower perforce a third Must take up us So is the unfirm king In three divided and his coffers sound With hollow poverty and emptiness ARCHBISHOP That he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance Need not be dreaded HASTINGS If he should do so He leaves his back unarmd the French and Welsh Baying him at the heels never fear that LORD BARDOLPH Who is it like should lead his forces hither HASTINGS The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth But who is substituted gainst the French I have no certain notice ARCHBISHOP Let us on And publish the occasion of our arms The commonwealth is sick of their own choice Their overgreedy love hath surfeited An habitation giddy and unsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart O thou fond many with what loud applause Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke Before he was what thou wouldst have him be And being now trimmd in thine own desires Thou beastly feeder art so full of him That thou provokst thyself to cast him up So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up And howlst to find it What trust is in these times They that when Richard lived would have him die Are now become enamourd on his grave Thou that threwst dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After th admired heels of Bolingbroke Criest now O earth yield us that king again And take thou this O thoughts of men accursed Past and to come seems best things present worst MOWBRAY Shall we go draw our numbers and set on HASTINGS We are times subjects

her heavenly picture Your message done hie home unto my chamber Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary Exit JULIA How many women would do such a message Alas poor Proteus thou hast entertained A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs Alas poor fool why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me Because he loves her he despiseth me Because I love him I must pity him This ring I gave him when he parted from me To bind him to remember my good will And now am I unhappy messenger To plead for that which I would not obtain To carry that which I would have refused To praise his faith which I would have dispraised I am my masters true confirmed love But cannot be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to myself Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly As heaven it knows I

madam than she is When she did think my master loved her well She in my judgement was as fair as you But since she did neglect her lookingglass And threw her sunexpelling mask away The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks And pinched the lilytincture of her face That now she is become as black as I SILVIA How tall was she JULIA About my stature for at Pentecost When all our pageants of delight were played Our youth got me to play the womans part And I was trimmed in Madam Julias gown Which served me as fit by all mens judgements As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height And at that time I made her weep agood For I did play a lamentable part Madam twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress moved therewithal Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow SILVIA She is beholding to thee gentle youth Alas poor lady desolate and

hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love Ill get me such a coloured periwig Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine Ay but her foreheads low and mines as high What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come shadow come and take this shadow up For tis thy rival O thou senseless form Thou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored And were there sense in his idolatry My substance should be statue in thy stead Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake That used me so or else by

              "content": "ful innocence doth hie But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie Imagine every eye beholds their blame For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame When silly groom God wot it was defect Of spirit life and bold audacity Such harmless creatures have a true respect To talk in deeds while others saucily Promise more speed but do it leisurely Even so this pattern of the wornout age Pawned honest looks but laid no words to gage His kindled duty kindled her mistrust That two red fires in both their faces blazed She thought he blushed as knowing Tarquins lust And blushing with him wistly on him gazed Her earnest eye did make him more amazed The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish The more she thought he spied in her some blemish But long she thinks till he return again And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone The weary time she cannot entertain For now tis stale to sigh to weep to groan So woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan That she her plaints a little while doth stay Pausing for means to mourn some newer way At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of skilful painting made for Priams Troy Before the which is drawn the power of Greece For Helens rape the city to destroy Threatning cloudkissing Ilion with annoy Which the conceited painter drew so proud As heaven it seemed to kiss the turrets bowed A thousand lamentable objects there In scorn of Nature Art gave lifeless life Many a dry drop seemed a weeping tear Shed for the slaughtered husband by the wife The red blood reeked to show the painters strife The dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights There might you see the labouring pioneer Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust And from the towers of Troy there would appear The very eyes of men through loopholes thrust Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust Such sweet observance in this work was had That one might see those faroff eyes look sad In great commanders grace and majesty You might behold triumphing in their faces In youth quick bearing and dexterity And here and there the painter interlaces Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces Which heartless peasants did so well resemble That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble In Ajax and Ulysses O what art Of physiognomy might one behold The face of either ciphered eithers heart Their face their manners most expressly told In Ajax eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent Showed deep regard and smiling government There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand As twere encouraging the Greeks to fight Making such sober action with his hand That it beguiled attention charmed the sight In speech it seemed his beard all silver white Wagged up and down and from his lips did fly Thin winding breath which purled up to the sky About him were a press of gaping faces Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice All jointly listning but with several graces As if some mermaid did their ears entice Some high some low the painter was so nice The scalps of many almost hid behind To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind Here one mans hand leaned on anothers head His nose being shadowed by his neighbours ear Here one being thronged bears back all bolln and red Another smothered seems to pelt and swear And in their rage such signs of rage they bear As but for loss of Nestors golden words It seemed they would debate with angry swords For much imaginary work was there Conceit deceitful so compact so kind That for Achilles image stood his spear Griped in an armed hand himself behind Was left unseen save to the eye of mind A hand a foot a face a leg a head Stood for the whole to be imagined And from the walls of strongbesieged Troy When their brave hope bold Hector marched to field Stood many Trojan mothers sharing joy To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield And to their hope they such odd action yield That through their light joy seemed to appear Like bright things stained a kind of heavy fear And from the strand of Dardan where they fought To Simois reedy banks the red blood ran Whose waves to imitate the battle sought With swelling ridges and their ranks began To break upon the galled shore and then Retire again till meeting greater ranks They join and shoot their foam at Simois banks To this wellpainted piece is Lucrece come To find a face where all distress is stelled Many she sees where cares have carved some But none where all distress and dolour dwelled Till she despairing Hecuba beheld Staring on Priams wounds with her old eyes Which bleeding under Pyrrhus proud foot lies In her the painter had anatomized Times ruin beautys wrack and grim cares reign Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised Of what she was no semblance did remain Her blue blood changed to black in every vein Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed Showed life imprisoned in a body dead On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes And shapes her sorrow to the beldams woes Who nothing wants to answer her but cries And bitter words to ban her cruel foes The painter was no god to lend her those And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong To give her so much grief and not a tongue Poor instrument quoth she without a sound Ill tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue And drop sweet balm in Priams painted wound And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies Show me the strumpet that began this stir That with my nails her beauty I may tear Thy heat of lust fond Paris did incur This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here And here in Troy for trespass of thine eye The sire the son the dame and daughter die Why should the private pleasure of some one Become the public plague of many moe Let sin alone committed light alone Upon his head that hath transgressed so Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe For ones offence why should so many fall To plague a private sin in general Lo here weeps Hecuba here Priam dies Here manly Hector faints here Troilus swounds Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds And one mans lust these many lives confounds Had doting Priam checked his sons desire Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire Here feelingly she weeps Troys painted woes For sorrow like a heavyhanging bell Once set on ringing with his own weight goes Then little strength rings out the doleful knell So Lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow She lends them words and she their looks doth borrow She throws her eyes about the painting round And who she finds forlorn she doth lament At last she sees a wretched image bound That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent His face though full of cares yet showed content Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes So mild that patience seemed to scorn his woes In him the painter laboured with his skill To hide deceit and give the harmless show An humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe Cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so That blushing red no guilty instance gave Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have But like a constant and confirmed devil He entertained a show so seeming just And therein so ensconced his secret evil That jealousy itself could not mistrust Falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such blackfaced storms Or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms The wellskilled workman this mild image drew For perjured Sinon whose enchanting story The credulous Old Priam after slew Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory Of richbuilt Ilion that the skies were sorry And little stars shot from their fixed places When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces This picture she advisedly perused And chid the painter for his wondrous skill Saying some shape in Sinons was abused So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill And still on him she gazed and gazing still Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied That she concludes the picture was belied It cannot be quoth she that so much guile She would have said can lurk in such a look But Tarquins shape came in her mind the while And from her tongue can lurk from cannot took It cannot be she in that sense forsook And turned it thus It cannot be I find But such a face should bear a wicked mind For even as subtle Sinon here is painted So sobersad so weary and so mild As if with grief or travail he had fainted To me came Tarquin armed too beguiled With outward honesty but yet defiledWith inward vice As Priam him did cherish So did I Tarquin so my Troy did perish Look look how listening Priam wets his eyes To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds Priam why art thou old and yet not wise For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds His eye drops fire no water thence proceeds Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city Such devils steal effects from lightless hell For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold And in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell These contraries such unity do hold Only to flatter fools and make them bold So Priams trust false Sinons tears doth flatter That he finds means to burn his Troy with water Here all enraged such passion her assails That patience is quite beaten from her breast She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails Comparing him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself detest At last she smilingly with this gives oer Fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow And time doth weary time with her complaining She looks for night and then she longs for morrow And both she thinks too long with her remaining Short time seems long in sorrows sharp sustaining Though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps And they that watch see time how slow it creeps Which all this time hath overslipped her thought That she with painted images hath spent Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep surmise of others detriment Losing her woes in shows of discontent It easeth some though none it ever cured To think their dolour others have endured But now the mindful messenger come back Brings home his lord and other company Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black And round about her teardistained eye Blue circles streamed like rainbows in the sky These watergalls in her dim element Foretell new storms to those already spent Which when her sadbeholding husband saw Amazedly in her sad face he stares Her eyes though sod in tears looked red and raw Her lively colour killed with deadly cares He hath no power to ask her how she fares Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance Met far from home wondring each others chance At last he takes her by the bloodless hand And thus begins What uncouth ill event Hath thee befalln that thou dost trembling stand Sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent Why art thou thus attired in discontent Unmask dear dear this moody heaviness And tell thy grief that we may give redress Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire Ere once she can discharge one word of woe At length addressed to answer his desire She modestly prepares to let them know Her honour is taen prisoner by the foe While Collatine and his consorted lords With sad attention long to hear her words And now this pale swan in her watry nest Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending Few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best Where no excuse can give the fault amending In me more woes than words are now depending And my laments would be drawn out too long To tell them all with one poor tired tongue Then be this all the task it hath to say Dear husband in the interest of thy bed A stranger came and on that pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head And what wrong else may be imagined By foul enforcement might be done to me From that alas thy Lucrece is not free For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight With shining falchion in my chamber came A creeping creature with a flaming light And softly cried Awake thou Roman dame And entertain my love else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will inflict If thou my loves desire do contradict For some hardfavoured groom of thine quoth he Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will Ill murder straight and then Ill slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsome act of lust and so did kill The lechers in their deed This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy With this I did begin to start and cry And then against my heart he sets his sword Swearing unless I took all patiently I should not live to speak another word So should my shame still rest upon record And never be forgot in mighty Rome The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom Mine enemy was strong my poor self weak And far the weaker with so strong a fear My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak No rightful plea might plead for justice there His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies O teach me how to make mine own excuse Or at the least this refuge let me find Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse Immaculate and spotless is my mind That was not forced that never was inclined To accessary yieldings but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure Lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss With head declined and voice dammed up with woe With sad set eyes and wretched arms across From lips newwaxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so But wretched as he is he strives in vain What he breathes out his breath drinks up again As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast In rage sent out recalled in rage being past Even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw To push grief on and back the same grief draw Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh Dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth Another power no flood by raining slaketh My woe too sensible thy passion maketh More feelingpainful Let it then suffice To drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes And for my sake when I might charm thee so For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me Be suddenly revenged on my foe Thine mine his own Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late yet let the traitor die For sparing justice feeds iniquity But ere I name him you fair lords quoth she Speaking to those that came with Collatine Shall plight your honourable faiths to me With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine For tis a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms Knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms At this request with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid As bound in knighthood to her imposition Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed But she that yet her sad task hath not said The protestation stops O speak quoth she How may this forced stain be wiped from me What is the quality of my offence Being constrained with dreadful circumstance May my pure mind with the foul act dispense My lowdeclined honour to advance May any terms acquit me from this chance The poisoned fountain clears itself again And why not I from this compelled stain With this they all at once began to say Her bodys stain her mind untainted clears While with a joyless smile she turns away The face that map which deep impression bears Of hard misfortune carved in it with tears No no quoth she no dame hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuses giving Here with a sigh as if her heart would break She throws forth Tarquins name He he she says But more than he her poor tongue could not speak Till after many accents and delays Untimely breathings sick and short assays She utters this He he fair lords tis he That guides this hand to give this wound to me Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast A harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed That blow did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted prison where it breathed Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed Her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly Lifes lasting date from cancelled destiny Stonestill astonished with this deadly deed Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew Till Lucrece father that beholds her bleed Himself on her selfslaughtered body threw And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murdrous knife and as it left the place Her blood in poor revenge held it in chase And bubbling from her breast it doth divide In two slow rivers that the crimson blood Circles her body in on every side Who like a latesacked island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood Some of her blood still pure and red remained And some looked black and that false Tarquin stained About the mourning and congealed face Of that black blood a watry rigol goes Which seems to weep upon the tainted place And ever since as pitying Lucrece woes Corrupted blood some watery token shows And blood untainted still doth red abide Blushing at that which is so putrified Daughter dear daughter old Lucretius cries That life was mine which thou hast here deprived If in the child the fathers image lies Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived Thou wast not to this end from me derived If children predecease progenitors We are their offspring and they none of ours Poor broken glass I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born But now that fair fresh mirror dim and old Shows me a bareboned death by time outworn O from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn And shivered all the beauty of my glass That I no more can see what once I was O time cease thou thy course and last no longer If they surcease to be that should survive Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger And leave the faltring feeble souls alive The old bees die the young possess their hive Then live sweet Lucrece live again and see Thy father die and not thy father thee By this starts Collatine as from a dream And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place And then in keycold Lucrece bleeding stream He falls and bathes the pale fear in his face And counterfeits to die with her a space Till manly shame bids him possess his breath And live to be revenged on her death The deep vexation of his inward soul Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue Who mad that sorrow should his use control Or keep him from hearteasing words so long Begins to talk but through his lips do throng Weak words so thick come in his poor hearts aid That no man could distinguish what he said Yet sometime Tarquin was pronounced plain But through his teeth as if the name he toreThis windy tempest till it blow up rain Held back his sorrows tide to make it more At last it rains and busy winds give oer Then son and father weep with equal strife Who should weep most for daughter or for wife The one doth call her his the other his Yet neither may possess the claim they lay The father says Shes mine O mine she is Replies her husband Do not take away My sorrows interest let no mourner say He weeps for her for she was only mine And only must be wailed by Collatine O quoth Lucretius I did give that life Which she too early and too late hath spilled Woe woe quoth Collatine she was my wife I owed her and tis mine that she hath killed My daughter and my wife with clamours filled The dispersed air who holding Lucrece life Answered their cries my daughter and my wife Brutus who plucked the knife from Lucrece side Seeing such emulation in their woe Began to clothe his wit in state and pride Burying in Lucrece wound his follys show He with the Romans was esteemed so As silly jeering idiots are with kings For sportive words and uttring foolish things But now he throws that shallow habit by Wherein deep policy did him disguise And armed his longhid wits advisedly To check the tears in Collatinus eyes Thou wronged lord of Rome quoth he arise Let my unsounded self supposed a fool Now set thy longexperienced wit to school Why Collatine is woe the cure for woe Do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds Is it revenge to give thyself a blow For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so To slay herself that should have slain her foe Courageous Roman do not steep thy heart In such relenting dew of lamentations But kneel with me and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with invocations That they will suffer these abominations Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased Now by the Capitol that we adore And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained By heavens fair sun that breeds the fat earths store By all our country rights in Rome maintained And by chaste Lucrece soul that late complained Her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife We will revenge the death of this true wife This said he struck his hand upon his breast And kissed the fatal knife to end his vow And to his protestation urged the rest Who wondring at him did his words allow Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow And that deep vow which Brutus made before He doth again repeat and that they swore When they had sworn to this advised doom They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence To show her bleeding body thorough Rome And so to publish Tarquins foul offence Which being done with speedy diligence The Romans plausibly did give consent To Tarquins everlasting banishment VENUS AND ADONIS Vilia miretur vulgus mihi flavus Apollo Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON and Baron of Titchfield Right Honourable I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your lordship nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen only if your honour seem but pleased I account myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of all idle hours till I have honoured you with some graver labour But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather and never after ear so barren a land for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest I leave it to your honourable survey and your honour to your hearts content which I wish may always answer your own wish and the worlds hopeful expectation Your honours in all duty WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE VENUS AND ADONIS Even as the sun with purplecolourd face Had taen his last leave of the weeping morn Rosecheekd Adonis hied him to the chase Hunting he lovd but love he laughd to scorn 4 Sickthoughted Venus makes amain unto him And like a boldfacd suitor gins to woo him Thrice fairer than myself thus she began The fields chief flower sweet above compare 8 Stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man More white and red than doves or roses are Nature that made thee with herself at strife Saith that the world hath ending with thy life 12 Vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed And rein his proud head to the saddlebow If thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know 16 Here come and sit where never serpent hisses And being set Ill smother thee with kisses And yet not cloy thy lips with loathd satiety But rather famish them amid their plenty 20 Making them red and pale with fresh variety Ten kisses short as one one long as twenty A summers day will seem an hour but short Being wasted in such timebeguiling sport 24 With this she seizeth on his sweating palm The precedent of pith and livelihood And trembling in her passion calls it balm Earths sovereign salve to do a goddess good 28 Being so enragd desire doth lend her force Courageously to pluck him from his horse Over one arm the lusty coursers rein Under her other was the tender boy 32 Who blushd and pouted in a dull disdain With leaden appetite unapt to toy She red and hot as coals of glowing fire He red for shame but frosty in desire 36 The studded bridle on a ragged bough Nimbly she fastensO how quick is love The steed is stalled up and even now To tie the rider she begins to prove 40 Backward she pushd him as she would be thrust And governd him in strength though not in lust So soon was she along as he was down Each leaning on their elbows and their hips 44 Now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown And gins to chide but soon she stops his lips And kissing speaks with lustful language broken If thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open 48 He burns with bashful shame she with her tears Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs To fan and blow them dry again she seeks 52 He saith she is immodest blames her miss What follows more she murders with a kiss Even as an empty eagle sharp by fast Tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone 56 Shaking her wings devouring all in haste Till either gorge be stuffd or prey be gone Even so she kissd his brow his cheek his chin And where she ends she doth anew begin 60 Forcd to content but never to obey Panting he lies and breatheth in her face She feedeth on the steam as on a prey And calls it heavenly moisture air of grace 64 Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers So they were dewd with such distilling showers Look how a bird lies tangled in a net So fastend in her arms Adonis lies 68 Pure shame and awd resistance made him fret Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes Rain added to a river that is rank Perforce will force it overflow the bank 72 Still she entreats and prettily entreats For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale Still is he sullen still he lours and frets Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale 76 Being red she loves him best and being white Her best is betterd with a more delight Look how he can she cannot choose but love And by her fair immortal hand she swears 80 From his soft bosom never to remove Till he take truce with her contending tears Which long have raind making her cheeks all wet And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt Upon this promise did he raise his chin 85 Like a divedapper peering through a wave Who being lookd on ducks as quickly in So offers he to give what she did crave 88 But when her lips were ready for his pay He winks and turns his lips another way Never did passenger in summers heat More thirst for drink than she for this good turn 92 Her help she sees but help she cannot get She bathes in water yet her fire must burn O pity gan she cry flinthearted boy Tis but a kiss I beg why art thou coy 96 I have been wood as I entreat thee now Even by the stern and direful god of war Whose sinewy neck in battle neer did bow Who conquers where he comes in every jar 100 Yet hath he been my captive and my slave And beggd for that which thou unaskd shalt have Over my altars hath he hung his lance His batterd shield his uncontrolled crest 104 And for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance To toy to wanton dally smile and jest Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red Making my arms his field his tent my bed 108 Thus he that overruld I overswayd Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain Strongtemperd steel his stronger strength obeyd Yet was he servile to my coy disdain 112 Oh be not proud nor brag not of thy might For mastring her that foild the god of fight Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine Though mine be not so fair yet are they red 116 The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine What seest thou in the ground hold up thy head Look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies Then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes 120 Art thou ashamd to kiss then wink again And I will wink so shall the day seem night Love keeps his revels where there are but twain Be bold to play our sport is not in sight 124 These blueveind violets whereon we lean Never can blab nor know not what we mean The tender spring upon thy tempting lip 127 Shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted Make use of time let not advantage slip Beauty within itself should not be wasted Fair flowers that are not gatherd in their prime Rot and consume themselves in little time 132 Were I hardfavourd foul or wrinkled old Illnurturd crooked churlish harsh in voice Oerworn despised rheumatic and cold Thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice 136 Then mightst thou pause for then I were not for thee But having no defects why dost abhor me Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow 139 Mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow My flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning My smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt Would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt 144 Bid me discourse I will enchant thine ear Or like a fairy trip upon the green Or like a nymph with long dishevelld hair Dance on the sands and yet no footing seen 148 Love is a spirit all compact of fire Not gross to sink but light and will aspire Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie 151These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky From morn till night even where I list to sport me Is love so light sweet boy and may it be That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee 156 Is thine own heart to thine own face affected Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left Then woo thyself be of thyself rejected Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft 160 Narcissus so himself himself forsook And died to kiss his shadow in the brook Torches are made to light jewels to wear Dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use 164 Herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear Things growing to themselves are growths abuse Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty Thou wast begot to get it is thy duty 168 Upon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed Unless the earth with thy increase be fed By law of nature thou art bound to breed That thine may live when thou thyself art dead 172 And so in spite of death thou dost survive In that thy likeness still is left alive By this the lovesick queen began to sweat For where they lay the shadow had forsook them 176 And Titan tired in the midday heat With burning eye did hotly overlook them Wishing Adonis had his team to guide So he were like him and by Venus side 180 And now Adonis with a lazy spright And with a heavy dark disliking eye His louring brows oerwhelming his fair sight Like misty vapours when they blot the sky 184 Souring his cheeks cries Fie no more of love The sun doth burn my face I must remove Ay me quoth Venus young and so unkind What bare excuses makst thou to be gone 188 Ill sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind Shall cool the heat of this descending sun Ill make a shadow for thee of my hairs If they burn too Ill quench them with my tears 192 The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm And lo I lie between that sun and thee The heat I have from thence doth little harm Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me 196 And were I not immortal life were done Between this heavenly and earthly sun Art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel Nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth 200 Art thou a womans son and canst not feel What tis to love how want of love tormenteth O had thy mother borne so hard a mind She had not brought forth thee but died unkind 204 What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this Or what great danger dwells upon my suit What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss Speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute 208 Give me one kiss Ill give it thee again And one for intrest if thou wilt have twain Fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone Wellpainted idol image dull and dead 212 Statue contenting but the eye alone Thing like a man but of no woman bred Thou art no man though of a mans complexion For men will kiss even by their own direction 216 This said impatience chokes her pleading tongue And swelling passion doth provoke a pause Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong Being judge in love she cannot right her cause 220 And now she weeps and now she fain would speak And now her sobs do her intendments break Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand Now gazeth she on him now on the ground 224 Sometimes her arms infold him like a band She would he will not in her arms be bound And when from thence he struggles to be gone She locks her lily fingers one in one 228 Fondling she saith since I have hemmd thee here Within the circuit of this ivory pale Ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer Feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 232 Graze on my lips and if those hills be dry Stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie Within this limit is relief enough Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain 236 Round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough To shelter thee from tempest and from rain Then be my deer since I am such a park 239 No dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark At this Adonis smiles as in disdain That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple Love made those hollows if himself were slain He might be buried in a tomb so simple 244 Foreknowing well if there he came to lie Why there love livd and there he could not die These lovely caves these round enchanting pits Opend their mouths to swallow Venus liking 248 Being mad before how doth she now for wits Struck dead at first what needs a second striking Poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn 252 Now which way shall she turn what shall she say Her words are done her woes the more increasing The time is spent her object will away And from her twining arms doth urge releasing 256 Pity she cries some favour some remorse Away he springs and hasteth to his horse But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by A breeding jennet lusty young and proud 260 Adonis tramping courser doth espy And forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud The strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he 264 Imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds And now his woven girths he breaks asunder The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds Whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder The iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth 269 Controlling what he was controlled with His ears upprickd his braided hanging mane Upon his compassd crest now stand on end 272 His nostrils drink the air and forth again As from a furnace vapours doth he send His eye which scornfully glisters like fire Shows his hot courage and his high desire 276 Sometime he trots as if he told the steps With gentle majesty and modest pride Anon he rears upright curvets and leaps As who should say Lo thus my strength is tried And this I do to captivate the eye 281 Of the fair breeder that is standing by What recketh he his riders angry stir His flattering Holla or his Stand I say 284 What cares he now for curb or pricking spur For rich caparisons or trappings gay He sees his love and nothing else he sees For nothing else with his proud sight agrees 288 Look when a painter would surpass the life In limning out a wellproportiond steed His art with natures workmanship at strife As if the dead the living should exceed 292 So did this horse excel a common one In shape in courage colour pace and bone Roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long Broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide Look what a horse should have he did not lack Save a proud rider on so proud a back 300 Sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares Anon he starts at stirring of a feather To bid the wind a base he now prepares And where he run or fly they know not whether 304 For through his mane and tail the high wind sings Fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings He looks upon his love and neighs unto her She answers him as if she knew his mind 308 Being proud as females are to see him woo her She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels Beating his kind embracements with her heels 312 Then like a melancholy malcontent He vails his tail that like a falling plume Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 316 His love perceiving how he was enragd Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd His testy master goeth about to take him When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear 320 Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him With her the horse and left Adonis there As they were mad unto the wood they hie them Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them 324 All swoln with chafing down Adonis sits Banning his boisterous and unruly beast And now the happy season once more fits That lovesick love by pleading may be blest 328 For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong When it is barrd the aidance of the tongue An oven that is stoppd or river stayd Burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 332 So of concealed sorrow may be said Free vent of words loves fire doth assuage But when the hearts attorney once is mute The client breaks as desperate in his suit 336 He sees her coming and begins to glow Even as a dying coal revives with wind And with his bonnet hides his angry brow Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 340 Taking no notice that she is so nigh For all askance he holds her in his eye O what a sight it was wistly to view How she came stealing to the wayward boy 344 To note the fighting conflict of her hue How white and red each other did destroy But now her cheek was pale and by and by It flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky 348 Now was she just before him as he sat And like a lowly lover down she kneels With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 352 His tendrer cheek receives her soft hands print As

breath But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue Ah now thou turnst away thy face for shame And notwithstanding all this loss of bloodAs from a conduit with three issuing spouts Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titans face Blushing to be encountered with a cloud Shall I speak for thee shall I say tis so O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast That I might rail at him to ease my mind Sorrow concealed like an oven stopped Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is Fair Philomela why she but lost her tongue And in a tedious sampler sewed her mind But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met And he hath cut those pretty fingers off That could have better sewed than Philomel O had the monster seen those lily hands Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute And make the silken strings delight to kiss them He would not then have touched them for his life Or had he heard the heavenly harmony Which that sweet tongue hath made He would have dropped his knife and fell asleep As Cerberus at the Thracian poets feet Come let us go and make thy father blind For such a sight will blind a fathers eye One hours storm will drown the fragrant meads What will whole months of tears thy fathers eyes Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee O could our mourning ease thy misery Exeunt ACT III SCENE I Rome A street Enter the Judges and Senators with Titus two sons Quintus and Martius bound passing on the stage to the place of execution and Titus going before pleading TITUS Hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay For pity of mine age whose youth was spent In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept For all my blood in Romes great quarrel shed For all the frosty nights that I have watched And for these bitter tears which now you see Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks Be pitiful to my condemned sons Whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought For two and twenty sons I never wept Because they died in honours lofty bed Andronicus lieth down and the Judges pass by him Exeunt with the prisoners as Titus continues speaking For these tribunes in the dust I write My hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears Let my tears staunch the earths dry appetite My sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush O earth I will befriend thee more with rain That shall distil from these two ancient urns Than youthful April shall with all his showers In summers drought Ill drop upon thee still In winter with warm tears Ill melt the snow And keep eternal springtime on thy face So thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn O reverend tribunes O gentle aged men Unbind my sons reverse the doom of death And let me say that never wept before My tears are now prevailing orators LUCIUS O noble father you lament in vain The tribunes hear you not no man is by And you recount your sorrows to a stone TITUS Ah Lucius for thy brothers let me plead Grave tribunes once more I entreat of you LUCIUS My gracious lord no tribune hears you speak TITUS Why tis no matter man If they did hear They would not mark me if they did mark They would not pity me yet plead I must And bootless unto them Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones Who though they cannot answer my distress Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes For that they will not intercept my tale When I do weep they humbly at my feet Receive my tears and seem to weep with me And were they but attired in grave weeds Rome could afford no tribunes like to these A stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones A stone is silent and offendeth not And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death But wherefore standst thou with thy weapon drawn LUCIUS To rescue my two brothers from their death For which attempt the judges have pronounced My everlasting doom of banishment TITUS O happy man they have befriended thee Why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers Tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey But me and mine How happy art thou then From these devourers to be banished But who comes with our brother Marcus here Enter Marcus with Lavinia MARCUS Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep Or if not so thy noble heart to break I bring consuming sorrow to thine age TITUS Will it consume me Let me see it then MARCUS This was thy daughter TITUS Why Marcus so she is LUCIUS Ay me this object kills me TITUS Fainthearted boy arise and look upon her Speak Lavinia what accursed hand Hath made thee handless in thy fathers sight What fool hath added water to the sea Or brought a faggot to brightburning Troy My grief was at the height before thou camst And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds Give me a sword Ill chop off my hands too For they have fought for Rome and all in vain And they have nursed this woe in feeding life In bootless prayer have they been held up And they have served me to effectless use Now all the service I require of them Is that the one will help to cut the other Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands For hands to do Rome service is but vain LUCIUS Speak gentle sister who hath martyred thee MARCUS O that delightful engine of her thoughts That blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung Sweet varied notes enchanting every ear LUCIUS O say thou for her who hath done this deed MARCUS O thus I found her straying in the park Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer That hath received some unrecuring wound TITUS It was my dear and he that wounded her Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead For now I stand as one upon a rock Environed with a wilderness of sea Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave Expecting ever when some envious surge Will in his brinish bowels swallow him This way to death my wretched sons are gone Here stands my other son a banished man And here my brother weeping at my woes But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn Is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul Had I but seen thy picture in this plight It would have madded me What shall I do Now I behold thy lively body so Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee Thy husband he is dead and for his death Thy brothers are condemned and dead by this Look Marcus Ah son Lucius look on her When I did name her brothers then fresh tears Stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew Upon a gathered lily almost withered MARCUS Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband Perchance because she knows them innocent TITUS If they did kill thy husband then be joyful Because the law hath taen revenge on them No no they would not do so foul a deed Witness the sorrow that their sister makes Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips Or make some sign how I may do thee ease Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius And thou and I sit round about some fountain Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks How they are stained like meadows yet not dry With miry slime left on them by a flood And in the fountain shall we gaze so long Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness And made a brinepit with our bitter tears Or shall we cut away our hands like thine Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows Pass the remainder of our hateful days What shall we do Let us that have our tongues Plot some device of further misery To make us wondered at in time to come LUCIUS Sweet father cease your tears for at your grief See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps MARCUS Patience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyes TITUS Ah Marcus Marcus Brother well I wot Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine For thou poor man hast drowned it with thine own LUCIUS Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks TITUS Mark Marcus mark I understand her signs Had she a tongue to speak now would she say That to her brother which I said to thee His napkin with his true tears all bewet Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks O what a sympathy of woe is this As far from help as limbo is from bliss Enter Aaron the Moor alone AARON Titus Andronicus my lord the emperor Sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus Or any one of you chop off your hand And send it to the king he for the same Will send thee hither both thy sons alive And that shall be the ransom for their fault TITUS O gracious emperor O gentle Aaron Did ever raven sing so like a lark That gives sweet tidings of the suns uprise With all my heart Ill send the emperor my hand Good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off LUCIUS Stay father for that noble hand of thine That hath thrown down so many enemies Shall not be sent My hand will serve the turn My youth can better spare my blood than you And therefore mine shall save my brothers lives MARCUS Which of your hands hath not defended Rome And reared aloft the bloody battleaxe Writing destruction on the enemys castle O none of both but are of high desert My hand hath been but idle let it serve To ransom my two nephews from their death Then have I kept it to a worthy end AARON Nay come agree whose hand shall go along For fear they die before their pardon come MARCUS My hand shall go LUCIUS By heaven it shall not go TITUS Sirs strive no more Such withered herbs as these Are meet for plucking up and therefore mine LUCIUS Sweet father if I shall be thought thy son Let me redeem my brothers both from death MARCUS And for our fathers sake and mothers care Now let me show a brothers love to thee TITUS Agree between you I will spare my hand LUCIUS Then Ill go fetch an axe MARCUS But I will use the axe Exeunt Lucius and Marcus TITUS Come hither Aaron Ill deceive them both Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine AARON Aside If that be called deceit I will be honest And never whilst I live deceive men so But Ill deceive you in another sort And that youll say ere half an hour pass He cuts off Tituss hand Enter Lucius and Marcus again TITUS Now stay your strife What shall be is dispatched Good Aaron give his majesty my hand Tell him it was a hand that warded him From thousand dangers bid him bury it More hath it merited that let it have As for my sons say I account of them As jewels purchased at an easy price And yet dear too because I bought mine own AARON I go Andronicus and for thy hand Look by and by to have thy sons with thee Aside Their heads I mean O how this villainy Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it Let fools do good and fair men call for graceAaron will have his soul black like his face Exit TITUS O here I lift this one hand up to heaven And bow this feeble ruin to the earth If any power pities wretched tears To that I call To Lavinia What wouldst thou kneel with me Do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers Or with our sighs well breathe the welkin dim And stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds When they do hug him in their melting bosoms MARCUS O brother speak with possibility And do not break into these deep extremes TITUS Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom Then be my passions bottomless with them MARCUS But yet let reason govern thy lament TITUS If there were reason for these miseries Then into limits could I bind my woes When heaven doth weep doth not the earth oerflow If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad Threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face And wilt thou have a reason for this coil I am the sea Hark how her sighs doth flow She is the weeping welkin I the earth Then must my sea be moved with her sighs Then must my earth with her continual tears Become a deluge overflowed and drowned For why my bowels cannot hide her woes But like a drunkard must I vomit them Then give me leave for losers will have leave To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand MESSENGER Worthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid For that good hand thou sentst the emperor Here are the heads of thy two noble sons And heres thy hand in scorn to thee sent back Thy grief their sports thy resolution mocked That woe is me to think upon thy woes More than remembrance of my fathers death Exit MARCUS Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily And be my heart an everburning hell These miseries are more than may be borne To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal But sorrow flouted at is double death LUCIUS Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound And yet detested life not shrink thereat That ever death should let life bear his name Where life hath no more interest but to breathe Lavinia kisses Titus MARCUS Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless As frozen water to a starved snake TITUS When will this fearful slumber have an end MARCUS Now farewell flattery die Andronicus Thou dost not slumber See thy two sons heads Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here Thy other banished son with this dear sight Struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I Even like a stony image cold and numb Ah now no more will I control thy griefs Rent off thy silver hair thy other hand Gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight The closing up of our most wretched eyes Now is a time to storm why art thou still TITUS Ha ha ha MARCUS Why dost thou laugh It fits not with this hour TITUS Why I have not another tear to shed Besides this sorrow is an enemy And would usurp upon my watery eyes And make them blind with tributary tears Then which way shall I find Revenges cave For these two heads do seem to speak to me And threat me I shall never come to bliss Till all these mischiefs be returned again Even in their throats that have committed them Come let me see what task I have to do You heavy people circle me about That I may turn me to each one of you And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs The vow is made Come brother take a head And in this hand the other will I bear And Lavinia thou shalt be employed in these arms Bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth As for thee boy go get thee from my sight Thou art an exile and thou must not stay Hie to the Goths and raise an army there And if you love me as I think you do Lets kiss and part for we have much to do Exeunt Titus Marcus and Lavinia LUCIUS Farewell Andronicus my noble father The woefullst man that ever lived in Rome Farewell proud Rome till Lucius come again He loves his pledges dearer than his life Farewell Lavinia my noble sister O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives But in oblivion and hateful griefs If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs And make proud Saturnine and his empress Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen Now will I to the Goths and raise a power To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine Exit SCENE II Rome A Room in Tituss House A banquet set out Enter Titus Andronicus Marcus Lavinia and the boy Young Lucius TITUS So so now sit and look you eat no more Than will preserve just so much strength in us As will revenge these bitter woes of ours Marcus unknit that sorrowwreathen knot Thy niece and I poor creatures want our hands And cannot passionate our tenfold grief With folded arms This poor right hand of mine Is left to tyrannize upon my breast Who when my heart all mad with misery Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh Then thus I thump it down Thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still Wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans Or get some little knife between thy teeth And just against thy heart make thou a hole That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall May run into that sink and soaking in Drown the lamenting fool in seasalt tears MARCUS Fie brother fie Teach her not thus to lay Such violent hands upon her tender life TITUS How now Has sorrow made thee dote already Why Marcus no man should be mad but I What violent hands can she lay on her life Ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands To bid neas tell the tale twice oer How Troy was burnt and he made miserable O handle not the theme to talk of hands Lest we remember still that we have none Fie fie how frantically I square my talk As if we should forget we had no hands If Marcus did not name the word of hands Come lets fall to and gentle girl eat this Here is no drink Hark Marcus what she says I can interpret all her martyred signs She says she drinks no other drink but tears Brewed with her sorrow meshed upon her cheeks Speechless complainer I will learn thy thought In thy dumb action will I be as perfect As begging hermits in their holy prayers Thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven Nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign But I of these will wrest an alphabet And by still practice learn to know thy meaning YOUNG LUCIUS Good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale MARCUS Alas the tender boy in passion moved Doth weep to see his grandsires heaviness TITUS Peace tender sapling thou art made of tears And tears will quickly melt thy life away Marcus strikes the dish with a knife What dost thou strike at Marcus with thy knife MARCUS At that that I have killed my lord a fly TITUS Out on thee murderer Thou killst my heart Mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny A deed of death done on the innocent Becomes not Titus brother Get thee gone I see thou art not for my company MARCUS Alas my lord I have but killed a fly TITUS But How if that fly had a father and mother How would he hang his slender gilded wings And buzz lamenting doings in the air Poor harmless fly That with his pretty buzzing melody Came here to make us merry and thou hast killed him MARCUS Pardon me sir twas a black illfavoured fly Like to the empress Moor therefore I killed him TITUS O O O Then pardon me for reprehending thee For thou hast done a charitable deed Give me thy knife I will insult on him Flattering myself as if it were the Moor Come hither purposely to poison me Theres for thyself and thats for Tamora Ah sirrah Yet I think we are not brought so low But that between us we can kill a fly That comes in likeness of a coalblack Moor MARCUS Alas poor man grief has so wrought on him He takes false shadows for true substances TITUS Come take away Lavinia go with me Ill to thy closet and go read with thee Sad stories chanced in the times of old Come boy and go with me Thy sight is young And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I Rome Before Tituss House Enter Young Lucius and Lavinia

in Rome she did MARCUS What means my niece Lavinia by these signs TITUS Fear her not Lucius Somewhat doth she mean See Lucius see how much she makes of thee Somewhither would she have thee go with her Ah boy Cornelia never with more care Read to her sons than she hath read to thee Sweet poetry and Tullys Orator MARCUS Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus YOUNG LUCIUS My lord I know not I nor can I guess Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her For I have heard my grandsire say full oft Extremity of griefs would make men mad And I have read that Hecuba of Troy Ran mad for sorrow That made me to fear Although my lord I know my noble aunt Loves me as dear as eer my mother did And would not but in fury fright my youth Which made me down to throw my books and fly Causeless perhaps But pardon me sweet aunt And madam if my uncle Marcus go I will most willingly attend your ladyship MARCUS Lucius I will Lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which Lucius has let fall TITUS How now Lavinia Marcus what means this Some book there is that she desires to see Which is it girl of these Open them boy But thou art deeper read and better skilled Come and take choice of all my library And so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens Reveal the damned contriver of this deed Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus MARCUS I think she means that there were more than one Confederate in the fact Ay more there was Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge TITUS Lucius what book is that she tosseth so YOUNG LUCIUS Grandsire tis Ovids Metamorphosis My mother gave it me MARCUS For love of her thats gone Perhaps she culled it from among the rest TITUS Soft So busily she turns the leaves Help her What would she find Lavinia shall I read This is the tragic tale of Philomel And treats of Tereus treason and his rape And rape I fear was root of thy annoy MARCUS See brother see Note how she quotes the leaves TITUS Lavinia wert thou thus surprised sweet girlRavished and wronged as Philomela was Forced in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods See see Ay such a place there is where we did hunt O had we never never hunted there Patterned by that the poet here describes By nature made for murders and for rapes MARCUS O why should nature build so foul a den Unless the gods delight in tragedies TITUS Give signs sweet girl for here are none but friends What Roman lord it was durst do the deed Or slunk not Saturnine as Tarquin erst That left the camp to sin in Lucrece bed MARCUS Sit down sweet niece Brother sit down by me Apollo Pallas Jove or Mercury Inspire me that I may this treason find My lord look here Look here Lavinia This sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst This after me I have writ my name He writes his name with his staff and guides it with feet and mouth Without the help of any hand at all Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift Write thou good niece and here display at last What God will have discovered for revenge Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain That we may know the traitors and the truth She takes the staff in her mouth and guides it with her stumps and writes O do ye read my lord what she hath writ TITUS Stuprum Chiron Demetrius MARCUS What what The lustful sons of Tamora Performers of this heinous bloody deed TITUS Magni Dominator poli Tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides MARCUS O calm thee gentle lord although I know There is enough written upon this earth To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts And arm the minds of infants to exclaims My lord kneel down with me Lavinia kneel And kneel sweet boy the Roman Hectors hope And swear with me as with the woeful fere And father of that chaste dishonoured dame Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece rape That we will prosecute by good advice Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths And see their blood or die with this reproach TITUS Tis sure enough an you knew how But if you hunt these bearwhelps then beware The dam will wake and if she wind you once Shes with the lion deeply still in league And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back And when he sleeps will she do what she list You are a young huntsman Marcus let alone And come I will go get a leaf of brass And with a gad of steel will write these words And lay it by The angry northern wind Will blow these sands like Sibyls leaves abroad And wheres our lesson then Boy what say you YOUNG LUCIUS I say my lord that if I were a man Their mothers bedchamber should not be safe For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome MARCUS Ay thats my boy Thy father hath full oft For his ungrateful country done the like YOUNG LUCIUS And uncle so will I an if I live TITUS Come go with me into mine armoury Lucius Ill fit thee and withal my boy Shall carry from me to the empress sons Presents that I intend to send them both Come come thoult do my message wilt thou not YOUNG LUCIUS Ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire TITUS No boy not so Ill teach thee another course Lavinia

Revenge ye heavens for old Andronicus Exit SCENE II Rome A Room in the Palace Enter Aaron Chiron and Demetrius at one door and at the other door Young Lucius and another with a bundle of weapons and

such a night Though twere to buy a world of happy days So full of dismal terror was the time KEEPER What was your dream my lord I pray you tell me CLARENCE Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy And in my company my brother Gloucester Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand heavy times During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befalln us As we paced alongUpon the giddy footing of the hatches Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling Struck me that thought to stay him overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main O Lord methought what pain it was to drown What dreadful noise of waters in my ears What sights of ugly death within my eyes Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl Inestimable stones unvalued jewels All scattered in the bottom of the sea Some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept As twere in scorn of eyesreflecting gems That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by KEEPER Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon these secrets of the deep CLARENCE Methought I had and often did I strive To yield the ghost but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty vast and wandring air But smothered it within my panting bulk Who almost burst to belch it in the sea KEEPER Awaked you not in this sore agony CLARENCE No no my dream was lengthened after life O then began the tempest to my soul I passed methought the melancholy flood With that sour ferryman which poets write of Unto the kingdom of perpetual night The first that there did greet my strangersoul Was my great fatherinlaw renowned Warwick Who spake aloud What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence And so he vanished Then came wandring by A shadow like an angel with bright hair Dabbled in blood and he shrieked out aloud Clarence is comefalse fleeting perjured Clarence That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury Seize on him Furies Take him unto torment With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends Environed me and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling waked and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell Such terrible impression made my dream KEEPER No marvel lord though it affrighted you I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it CLARENCE Ah Keeper Keeper I have done these things That now give evidence against my soul For Edwards sake and see how he requites me O God if my deep prayers cannot appease Thee But Thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children Keeper I prithee sit by me awhile My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep KEEPER I will my lord God give your Grace good rest Clarence reposes himself on a chair Enter Brakenbury the Lieutenant BRAKENBURY Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours Makes the night morning and the noontide night Princes have but their titles for their glories An outward honour for an inward toil And for unfelt imaginations They often feel a world of restless cares So that between their titles and low name Theres nothing differs but the outward fame Enter the two Murderers FIRST MURDERER Ho whos here BRAKENBURY What wouldst thou fellow And how camst thou hither SECOND MURDERER I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs BRAKENBURY What so brief FIRST MURDERER Tis better sir than to be tedious Let him see our commission and talk no more Brakenbury reads the commission BRAKENBURY I am in this commanded to deliver The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless of the meaning There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys Ill to the King and signify to him That thus I have resigned to you my charge FIRST MURDERER You may sir tis a point of wisdom Fare you well Exeunt Brakenbury and the Keeper SECOND MURDERER What shall I stab him as he sleeps FIRST MURDERER No Hell say twas done cowardly when he wakes SECOND MURDERER Why he shall never wake until the great Judgement Day FIRST MURDERER Why then hell say we stabbed him sleeping SECOND MURDERER The urging of that word judgement hath bred a kind of remorse in me FIRST MURDERER What art thou afraid SECOND MURDERER Not to kill him having a warrant but to be damned for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me FIRST MURDERER I thought thou hadst been resolute SECOND MURDERER So I amto let him live FIRST MURDERER Ill back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so SECOND MURDERER Nay I prithee stay a little I hope this passionate humour will change It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty FIRST MURDERER How dost thou feel thyself now SECOND MURDERER Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me FIRST MURDERER Remember our reward when the deeds done SECOND MURDERER Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward FIRST MURDERER Wheres thy conscience now SECOND MURDERER O in the Duke of Gloucesters purse FIRST MURDERER So when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out SECOND MURDERER Tis no matter let it go Theres few or none will entertain it FIRST MURDERER What if it come to thee again SECOND MURDERER Ill not meddle with it it makes a man coward A man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it detects him Tis a blushing shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom It fills a man full of obstacles It made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found It beggars any man that keeps it It is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it FIRST MURDERER Zounds tis even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the Duke SECOND MURDERER Take the devil in thy mind and believe him not He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh FIRST MURDERER I am strongframed he cannot prevail with me SECOND MURDERER Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation Come shall we fall to work FIRST MURDERER Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then throw him in the malmseybutt in the next room SECOND MURDERER O excellent deviceand make a sop of him FIRST MURDERER Soft he wakes SECOND MURDERER Strike FIRST MURDERER No well reason with him CLARENCE Where art thou keeper Give me a cup of wine SECOND MURDERER You shall have wine enough my lord anon CLARENCE In Gods name what art thou FIRST MURDERER A man as you are CLARENCE But not as I am royal SECOND MURDERER Nor you as we are loyal CLARENCE Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble FIRST MURDERER My voice is now the Kings my looks mine own CLARENCE How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak Your eyes do menace me why look you pale Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come SECOND MURDERER To to to CLARENCE To murder me BOTH MURDERERS Ay ay CLARENCE You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it Wherein my friends have I offended you FIRST MURDERER Offended us you have not but the King CLARENCE I shall be reconciled to him again SECOND MURDERER Never my lord therefore prepare to die CLARENCE Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent What is my offence Where is the evidence that doth accuse me What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death Before I be convict by course of law To threaten me with death is most unlawful I charge you as you hope to have redemption By Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins That you depart and lay no hands on me The deed you undertake is damnable FIRST MURDERER What we will do we do upon command SECOND MURDERER And he that hath commanded is our King CLARENCE Erroneous vassals The great King of kings Hath in the table of his law commanded That thou shalt do no murder Will you then Spurn at His edict and fulfil a mans Take heed for He holds vengeance in His hand To hurl upon their heads that break His law SECOND MURDERER And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight In quarrel of the house of Lancaster FIRST MURDERER And like a traitor to the name of God Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade Unrippedst the bowels of thy sovereigns son SECOND MURDERER Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend FIRST MURDERER How canst thou urge Gods dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree CLARENCE Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed For Edward for my brother for his sake He sends you not to murder me for this For in that sin he is as deep as I If God will be avenged for the deed O know you yet He doth it publicly Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him FIRST MURDERER Who made thee then a bloody minister When gallantspringing brave Plantagenet That princely novice was struck dead by thee CLARENCE My brothers love the devil and my rage FIRST MURDERER Thy brothers love our duty and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee CLARENCE If you do love my brother hate not me I am his brother and I love him well If you are hired for meed go back again And I will send you to my brother Gloucester Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death SECOND MURDERER You are deceived Your brother Gloucester hates you CLARENCE O no he loves me and he holds me dear Go you to him from me FIRST MURDERER Ay so we will CLARENCE Tell him when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm And charged us from his soul to love each other He little thought of this divided friendship Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep FIRST MURDERER Ay millstones as he lessoned us to weep CLARENCE O do not slander him for he is kind FIRST MURDERER Right as snow in harvest Come you deceive yourself Tis he that sends us to destroy you here CLARENCE It cannot be for he bewept my fortune And hugged me in his arms and swore with sobs That he would labour my delivery FIRST MURDERER Why so he doth when he delivers you From this earths thraldom to the joys of heaven SECOND MURDERER Make peace with God for you must die my lord CLARENCE Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God And are you yet to your own souls so blind That you will war with God by murdring me O sirs consider they that set you onTo do this deed will hate you for the deed SECOND MURDERER What shall we do CLARENCE Relent and save your souls FIRST MURDERER Relent No tis cowardly and womanish CLARENCE Not to relent is beastly savage devilish Which of youif you were a princes son Being pent from liberty as I am now If two such murderers as yourselves came to you Would not entreat for life Ay you would beg Were you in my distress My friend I spy some pity in thy looks O if thine eye be not a flatterer Come thou on my side and entreat for me A begging prince what beggar pities not SECOND MURDERER Look behind you my lord FIRST MURDERER Take that and that Stabs him If all this will not do Ill drown you in the malmseybutt within Exit with the body SECOND MURDERER A bloody deed and desperately dispatched How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands Of this most grievous murder Enter First Murderer FIRST MURDERER How now What meanst thou that thou helpst me not By heavens the Duke shall know how slack you have been SECOND MURDERER I would he knew that I had saved his brother Take thou the fee and tell him what I say For I repent me that the Duke is slain Exit FIRST MURDERER So do not I Go coward as thou art Well Ill go hide the body in some hole Till that the Duke give order for his burial And when I have my meed I will away For this will out and then I must not stay Exit ACT II SCENE I London A Room in the palace Enter King Edward sick Queen Elizabeth Dorset Rivers Hastings Buckingham Grey and others KING EDWARD Why so Now have I done a good days work You peers continue this united league I every day expect an embassage From my Redeemer to redeem me hence And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven Since I have made my

here How many stand for consulships SECOND OFFICER Three they say but tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it FIRST OFFICER Thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury To report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it FIRST OFFICER No more of him hes a worthy man Make way They are coming A sennet Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the people Lictors before them Coriolanus Menenius Cominius the consul The Patricians sit Sicinius and Brutus take their places by themselves Coriolanus stands MENENIUS Having determined of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius it remains As the main point of this our aftermeeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our wellfound successes to report A little of that worthy work performed By Martius Caius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself Coriolanus sits FIRST SENATOR Speak good Cominius Leave nothing out for length and make us think Rather our states defective for requital Than we to stretch it out Masters o th people We do request your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here SICINIUS We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly BRUTUS Which the rather We shall be blest to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at MENENIUS Thats off thats off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speak BRUTUS Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it MENENIUS He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speak Coriolanus rises and offers to go away Nay keep your place FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear What you have nobly done CORIOLANUS Your Honours pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them BRUTUS Sir I hope My words disbenched you not CORIOLANUS No sir Yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You soothed not therefore hurt not but your people I love them as they weigh MENENIUS Pray now sit down CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered Exit MENENIUS Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one ons ears to hear itProceed Cominius COMINIUS I shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver if it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him He bestrid An oerpressed Roman and i th Consuls view Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met And struck him on his knee In that days feats When he might act the woman in the scene He proved best man i th field and for his meed Was browbound with the oak His pupil age Manentered thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurched all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioles let me say I cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport As weeds before A vessel under sail so men obeyed And fell below his stem His sword Deaths stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was timed with dying cries Alone he entered The mortal gate o th city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioles like a planet Now alls his When by and by the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Requickened what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking oer the lives of men as if Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting MENENIUS Worthy man FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at And looked upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it MENENIUS Hes right noble Let him be called for FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus OFFICER He doth appear Enter Coriolanus MENENIUS The Senate Coriolanus are well pleased To make thee consul CORIOLANUS I do owe them still My life and services MENENIUS It then remains That you do speak to the people CORIOLANUS I do beseech you Let me oerleap that custom for I cannot Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds sake to give their suffrage Please you That I may pass this doing SICINIUS Sir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony MENENIUS Put them not tot Pray you go fit you to the custom and Take to you as your predecessors have Your honour with your form CORIOLANUS It is a part That I shall blush in acting and might well Be taken from the people BRUTUS Mark you that CORIOLANUS To brag unto them thus I did and thus Show them th unaching scars which I should hide As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only MENENIUS Do not stand upont We recommend to you tribunes of the people Our purpose to them and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour SENATORS To Coriolanus come all joy and honour Flourish cornets Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus BRUTUS You see how he intends to use the people SICINIUS May they perceives intent He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give BRUTUS Come well inform them Of our proceedings here On th marketplace I know they do attend us Exeunt SCENE III Rome The Forum Enter seven or eight Citizens FIRST CITIZEN Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him SECOND CITIZEN We may sir if we will THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them So if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude THIRD CITIZEN We have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o th compass SECOND CITIZEN Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would flyTHIRD CITIZEN Nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans will tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead But if it were at liberty twould sure southward SECOND CITIZEN Why that way THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife SECOND CITIZEN You are never without your tricks You may you may THIRD CITIZEN Are you all resolved to give your voices But thats no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility with Menenius Here he comes and in the gown of humility Mark his behaviour We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes Hes to make his requests by particulars wherein everyone of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues Therefore follow me and Ill direct you how you shall go by him ALL Content content Exeunt MENENIUS O sir you are not right Have you not known The worthiest men have donet CORIOLANUS What must I say I pray sirplague upont I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace Look sir my wounds I got them in my countrys service when Some certain of your brethren roared and ran From th noise of our own drums MENENIUS O me the gods You must not speak of that You must desire them To think upon you CORIOLANUS Think upon me Hang em I would they would forget me like the virtues Which our divines lose by em MENENIUS Youll mar all Ill leave you Pray you speak to em I pray you In wholesome manner Exit Menenius CORIOLANUS Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean Enter three of the Citizens So here comes a brace You know the cause sirs of my standing here THIRD CITIZEN We do sir Tell us what hath brought you tot CORIOLANUS Mine own desert SECOND CITIZEN Your own desert CORIOLANUS Ay but not mine own desire THIRD CITIZEN How not your own desire CORIOLANUS No sir twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging THIRD CITIZEN You must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you CORIOLANUS Well then I pray your price o th consulship FIRST CITIZEN The price is to ask it kindly CORIOLANUS Kindly sir I pray let me hat I have wounds to show you which shall be yours in privateYour good voice sir What say you SECOND CITIZEN You shall ha it worthy sir CORIOLANUS A match sir Theres in all two worthy voices begged I have your alms Adieu THIRD CITIZEN But this is something odd SECOND CITIZEN An twere to give againbut tis no matter Exeunt two citizens Enter two other Citizens CORIOLANUS Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown FOURTH CITIZEN You have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly CORIOLANUS Your enigma FOURTH CITIZEN You have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common people CORIOLANUS You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle And since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly That is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you I may be consul FIFTH CITIZEN We hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily FOURTH CITIZEN You have received many wounds for your country CORIOLANUS I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther BOTH CITIZENS The gods give you joy sir heartily Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices Better it is to die better to starve Than crave the hire which first we do deserve Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear Their needless vouches Custom calls me tot What custom wills in all things should we dot The dust on antique time would lie unswept And mountainous error be too highly heaped For truth to oerpeer Rather than fool it so Let the high office and the honour go To one that would do thus I am half through The one part suffered the other will I do Enter three Citizens more Here come more voices Your voices For your voices I have fought Watched for your voices for your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of for your voices have Done many things some less some more Your voices Indeed I would be consul SIXTH CITIZEN He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voice SEVENTH CITIZEN Therefore let him be consul The gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people ALL THREE CITIZENS Amen amen God save thee noble consul Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS Worthy voices Enter Menenius with Brutus and Sicinius MENENIUS You have stood your limitation and the Tribunes Endue you with the peoples voice Remains That in th official marks invested you Anon do meet the Senate CORIOLANUS Is this done SICINIUS The custom of request you have discharged The people do admit you and are summoned To meet anon upon your approbation CORIOLANUS Where At the Senate House SICINIUS There Coriolanus CORIOLANUS May I change these garments SICINIUS You may sir CORIOLANUS That Ill straight do and knowing myself again Repair to th Senate House MENENIUS Ill keep you companyWill you along BRUTUS We stay here for the people SICINIUS Fare you well Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius He has it now and by his looks methinks Tis warm at his heart BRUTUS With a proud heart he wore His humble weeds Will you dismiss the people Enter the Pebleians SICINIUS How now my masters have you chose this man FIRST CITIZEN He has our voices sir BRUTUS We pray the gods he may deserve your loves SECOND CITIZEN Amen sir To my poor unworthy notice He mocked us when he begged our voices THIRD CITIZEN Certainly he flouted us downright FIRST CITIZEN No tis his kind of speech He did not mock us SECOND CITIZEN Not one amongst us save yourself but says He used us scornfully He should have showed us His marks of merit wounds received fors country SICINIUS Why so he did I am sure ALL No no No man saw em THIRD CITIZEN He said he had wounds which he could show in private And with his hat thus waving it in scorn I would be consul says he aged custom But by your voices will not so permit me Your voices therefore When we granted that Here was I thank you for your voices Thank you Your most sweet voices Now you have left your voices I have no further with you Was not this mockery SICINIUS Why either were you ignorant to seet Or seeing it of such childish friendliness To yield your voices BRUTUS Could you not have told him As you were lessoned When he had no power But was a petty servant to the state He was your enemy ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I th body of the weal and now arriving A place of potency and sway o th state If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to th plebeii your voices might Be curses to yourselves You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love Standing your friendly lord SICINIUS Thus to have said As you were foreadvised had touched his spirit And tried his inclination from him plucked Either his gracious promise which you might As cause had called you up have held him to Or else it would have galled his surly nature Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught So putting him to rage You should have taen th advantage of his choler And passed him unelected BRUTUS Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies No heart among you Or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment SICINIUS Have you ere now denied the asker and now Again of him that did not ask but mock Bestow your suedfor tongues THIRD CITIZEN Hes not confirmed We may deny him yet SECOND CITIZEN And will deny him Ill have five hundred voices of that sound FIRST CITIZEN I twice five hundred and their friends to piece em BRUTUS Get you hence instantly and tell those friends They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so SICINIUS Let them assemble And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election Enforce his pride And his old hate unto you Besides forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed How in his suit he scorned you but your loves Thinking upon his services took from you Th apprehension of his present portance Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you BRUTUS Lay A fault on us your tribunes that we laboured No impediment between but that you must Cast your election on him SICINIUS Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections and that your minds Preoccupied with what you rather must do Than what you should made you against the grain To voice him consul Lay the fault on us BRUTUS Ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you How youngly he began to serve his country How long continued and what stock he springs of The noble house o th Martians from whence came That Ancus Martius Numas daughters son Who after great Hostilius here was king Of the same house Publius and Quintus were That our best water brought by conduits hither And Censorinus that was so surnamed And nobly named so twice being censor Was his great ancestor SICINIUS One thus descended That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place we did commend To your remembrances but you have found Scaling his present bearing with his past That hes your fixed enemy and revoke Your sudden approbation BRUTUS Say you neer had donet Harp on that stillbut by our putting on And presently when you have drawn your number Repair to th Capitol ALL We will so Almost all Repent in their electionExeunt Plebeians BRUTUS Let them go on This mutiny were better put in hazard Than stay past doubt for greater If as his nature is he fall in rage With their refusal both observe and answer The vantage of his anger SICINIUS To th Capitol come We will be there before the stream o th people And this shall seem as partly tis their own Which we have goaded onward Exeunt ACT III SCENE I Rome A street Cornets Enter Coriolanus Menenius all the Gentry Cominius Titus Lartius and other Senators CORIOLANUS Tullus Aufidius then had made new head LARTIUS He had my lord and that it was which caused Our swifter composition CORIOLANUS So then the Volsces stand but as at first Ready when time shall prompt them to make road Upons again COMINIUS They are worn lord consul so That we shall hardly in our ages see Their banners wave again CORIOLANUS Saw you Aufidius LARTIUS On safeguard he came to me and did curse Against the Volsces for they had so vilely Yielded the town He is retired to Antium CORIOLANUS Spoke he of me LARTIUS He did my lord CORIOLANUS How What LARTIUS How often he had met you sword to sword That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes To hopeless restitution so he might Be called your vanquisher CORIOLANUS At Antium lives he LARTIUS At Antium CORIOLANUS I wish I had a cause to seek him there To oppose his hatred fully Welcome home Enter Sicinius and Brutus Behold these are the tribunes of the people The tongues o th common mouth I do despise them For they do prank them in authority Against all noble sufferance SICINIUS Pass no further CORIOLANUS Ha What is that BRUTUS It will be dangerous to go on No further CORIOLANUS What makes this change MENENIUS The matter COMINIUS Hath he not passed the noble and the common BRUTUS Cominius no CORIOLANUS Have I had childrens voices FIRST SENATOR Tribunes give way He shall to the marketplace BRUTUS The people are incensed against him SICINIUS Stop Or all will fall in broil CORIOLANUS Are these your herd Must these have voices that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth Have you not set them on MENENIUS Be calm be calm CORIOLANUS It is a purposed thing and grows by plot To curb the will of the nobility Suffert and live with such as cannot rule Nor ever will be ruled BRUTUS Callt not a plot The people cry you mocked them and of late When corn was given them gratis you repined Scandaled the suppliants for the people

insolence sedition Which we ourselves have ploughed for sowed and scattered By mingling them with us the honoured number Who lack not virtue no nor power but that Which they have given to beggars MENENIUS Well no more FIRST SENATOR No more words we beseech you CORIOLANUS How No more As for my country I have shed my blood Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs Coin words till their decay against those measles Which we disdain should tetter us yet sought The very way to catch them BRUTUS You speak o th people As if you were a god to punish not A man of their infirmity SICINIUS Twere well We let the people knowt MENENIUS What what His choler CORIOLANUS Choler Were I as patient as the midnight sleep By Jove twould be my mind SICINIUS It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is Not poison any further CORIOLANUS Shall remain Hear you this Triton of the minnows Mark you His absolute shall COMINIUS Twas from the canon CORIOLANUS Shall O good but most unwise patricians why You grave but reckless senators have you thus Given Hydra leave to choose an officer That with his peremptory shall being but The horn and noise o th monsters wants not spirit To say hell turn your current in a ditch And make your channel his If he have power Then vail your ignorance if none awake Your dangerous lenity If you are learned Be not as common fools if you are not Let them have cushions by you You are plebeians If they be senators and they are no less When both your voices blended the greatst taste Most palates theirs They choose their magistrate And such a one as he who puts his shall His popular shall against a graver bench Than ever frowned in Greece By Jove himself It makes the consuls base And my soul aches To know when two authorities are up Neither supreme how soon confusion May enter twixt the gap of both and take The one by th other COMINIUS Well on to th marketplace CORIOLANUS Whoever gave that counsel to give forth The corn o th storehouse gratis as twas used Sometime in Greece MENENIUS Well well no more of that CORIOLANUS Though there the people had more absolute power I say they nourished disobedience fed The ruin of the state BRUTUS Why shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice CORIOLANUS Ill give my reasons More worthier than their voices They know the corn Was not our recompense resting well assured They neer did service fort Being pressed to th war Even when the navel of the state was touched They would not thread the gates This kind of service Did not deserve corn gratis Being i th war Their mutinies and revolts wherein they showed Most valour spoke not for them Th accusation Which they have often made against the Senate All cause unborn could never be the native Of our so frank donation Well what then How shall this bosom multitude digest The senates courtesy Let deeds express Whats like to be their words We did request it We are the greater poll and in true fear They gave us our demands Thus we debase The nature of our seats and make the rabble Call our cares fears which will in time Break ope the locks o th Senate and bring in The crows to peck the eagles MENENIUS Come enough BRUTUS Enough with overmeasure CORIOLANUS No take more What may be sworn by both divine and human Seal what I end withal This double worship Where one part does disdain with cause the other Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom Cannot conclude but by the yea and no Of general ignoranceit must omit Real necessities and give way the while To unstable slightness Purpose so barred it follows Nothing is done to purpose Therefore beseech you You that will be less fearful than discreet That love the fundamental part of state More than you doubt the change ont that prefer A noble life before a long and

judgment and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should becomet Not having the power to do the good it would For th ill which doth controlt BRUTUS Has said enough SICINIUS Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer As traitors do CORIOLANUS Thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee What should the people do with these bald tribunes On whom depending their obedience fails To th greater bench In a rebellion When whats not meet but what must be was law Then were they chosen In a better hour Let what is meet be said it must be meet And throw their power i th dust BRUTUS Manifest treason SICINIUS

The people are the city BRUTUS By the consent of all we were established The peoples magistrates ALL PLEBEIANS You so remain MENENIUS And so are like to do COMINIUS That is the way to lay the city flat To bring the roof to the foundation And bury all which yet distinctly ranges In heaps and piles of ruin SICINIUS This deserves death BRUTUS Or let us stand to our authority Or let us lose it We do here pronounce Upon the part o th people in whose power We were elected theirs Martius is worthy Of present death SICINIUS Therefore lay hold of him Bear him to th rock Tarpeian and from thence Into destruction cast him BRUTUS Aediles seize him ALL PLEBEIANS Yield Martius yield MENENIUS Hear me one word Beseech you tribunes hear me but a wordAEDILES Peace peace MENENIUS Be that you seem

Tribunes the Aediles and the People are beat in MENENIUS Go get you to your house Begone away All will be naught else SECOND SENATOR Get you gone CORIOLANUS Stand fast We have as many friends as enemies MENENIUS Shall it be put to that FIRST SENATOR The gods forbid I prithee noble friend home to thy house Leave us to cure this cause MENENIUS For tis a sore upon us You cannot tent yourself Begone beseech you COMINIUS Come sir along with us CORIOLANUS I would they were barbarians as they are Though in Rome littered not Romans as they are not Though calved i th porch o th Capitol MENENIUS Begone Put not your worthy rage into your tongue One time will owe another CORIOLANUS On fair ground I could beat forty of them MENENIUS I could myself Take up a brace o th best of them yea the two tribunes COMINIUS But now tis odds beyond arithmetic And manhood is called foolery when it stands Against a falling fabric Will you hence Before the tag return whose rage doth rend Like interrupted waters and oerbear What they are used to bear MENENIUS Pray you begone Ill try whether my old wit be in request With those that have but little This must be patched With cloth of any colour COMINIUS Nay come away Exeunt Coriolanus and Cominius PATRICIAN This man has marred his fortune MENENIUS His nature is too noble for the world He would not flatter Neptune for his trident Or Jove fors power to thunder His hearts his mouth What his breast forges that his tongue must vent And being angry does forget that ever He heard the name of death A noise within Heres goodly work PATRICIAN I would they were abed MENENIUS I would they were in Tiber What the vengeance Could he not speak em fair Enter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble again SICINIUS Where is this viper That would depopulate the city and Be every man himself MENENIUS You worthy tribunes SICINIUS He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock With rigorous hands He hath resisted law And therefore law shall scorn him further trial Than the severity of the public power Which he so sets at naught FIRST CITIZEN He shall well know The noble tribunes are the peoples mouths And we their hands ALL PLEBEIANS He shall sure ont MENENIUS Sir

people I may be heard I would crave a word or two The which shall turn you to no further harm Than so much loss of time SICINIUS Speak briefly then For we are peremptory to dispatch This viperous traitor To eject him hence Were but one danger and to keep him here Our certain death Therefore it is decreed He dies tonight MENENIUS Now the good gods forbid That our renowned Rome whose gratitude Towards her deserved children is enrolled In Joves own book like an unnatural dam Should now eat up her own SICINIUS Hes a disease that must be cut away MENENIUS O hes a limb that has but a disease Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy What has he done to Rome thats worthy death Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath By many an ouncehe dropt it for his country And what is left to lose it by his country Were to us all that dot and suffer it A brand to th end o th world SICINIUS This is clean cam BRUTUS Merely awry When he did love his country It honoured him MENENIUS The service of the foot Being once gangrened is not then respected For what before it was BRUTUS Well hear no more Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence Lest his infection being of catching nature Spread further MENENIUS One word more one word This tigerfooted rage when it shall find The harm of unscanned swiftness will too late Tie leaden pounds tos heels Proceed by

resisted Come MENENIUS Consider this he has been bred i th wars Since he could draw a sword and is ill schooled In bolted language meal and bran together He throws without distinction Give me leave Ill go to him and undertake to bring him Where he shall answer by a lawful form In peace to his utmost peril FIRST SENATOR Noble tribunes It is the humane way the other course Will prove too bloody and the end of it Unknown to the beginning SICINIUS Noble Menenius Be you then as the peoples officer Masters lay down your weapons BRUTUS Go not home SICINIUS Meet on the marketplace Well attend you there Where if you bring not Martius well proceed In our first way MENENIUS Ill bring him to you To Senators Let me desire your company He must come Or what is worst will follow FIRST SENATOR Pray you lets to him Exeunt SCENE II Rome A room in Coriolanuss house Enter Coriolanus with Nobles CORIOLANUS Let them pull all about mine ears present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses heels Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock That the precipitation might down stretch Below the beam of sight yet will I still Be thus to them FIRST PATRICIAN You do the nobler CORIOLANUS I muse my mother Does not approve me further who was wont To call them woollen vassals things created To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads In congregations to yawn be still and wonder When one but of my ordinance stood up To speak of peace or war Enter Volumnia I talk of you Why did you wish me milder Would you have me False to my nature Rather say I play The man I am VOLUMNIA O sir sir sir I would have had you put your power well on Before you had worn it out CORIOLANUS Let go VOLUMNIA You might have been enough the man you are With striving less to be so Lesser had been The thwartings of your dispositions if You had not showed them how ye were disposed Ere they lacked power to cross you CORIOLANUS Let them hang VOLUMNIA Ay and burn too Enter Menenius with the Senators MENENIUS Come come

craves it as physic For the whole stateI would put mine armour on Which I can scarcely bear CORIOLANUS What must I do MENENIUS Return to th Tribunes CORIOLANUS Well what then What then MENENIUS Repent

sleep in dreams they look on thee And darkly bright are bright in dark directed Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadows form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so How would I say mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay All days are nights to see till I see thee And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 44 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought Injurious distance should not stop my way For then despite of space I would be brought From limits far remote where thou dost stay No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be But ah thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone But that so much of earth and water wrought I must attend times leisure with my moan Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears badges of eithers woe 45 The other two slight air and purging fire Are both with thee wherever I abide The first my thought the other my desire These presentabsent with swift motion slide For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee My life being made of four with two alone Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy Until lifes composition be recured By those swift messengers returned from thee Who even but now come back again assured Of thy fair health recounting it to me This told I joy but then no longer glad I send them back again and straight grow sad 46 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar My heart mine eye the freedom of that right My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie A closet never pierced with crystal eyes But the defendant doth that plea deny And says in him thy fair appearance lies To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart And by their verdict is determined The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part And my hearts right thy inward love of heart 47 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took And each doth good turns now unto the other When that mine eye is famished for a look Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother With my loves picture then my eye doth feast And to the painted banquet bids my heart Another time mine eye is my hearts guest And in his thoughts of love doth share a part So either by thy picture or my love Thyself away art present still with me For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move And I am still with them and they with thee Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight 48 How careful was I when I took my way Each trifle under truest bars to thrust That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust But thou to whom my jewels trifles are Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief Thou best of dearest and mine only care Art left the prey of every vulgar thief Thee have I not locked up in any chest Save where thou art not though I feel thou art Within the gentle closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 49 Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my defects When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws Since why to love I can allege no cause 50 How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary travels end Doth teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend The beast that bears me tired with my woe Plods dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide Which heavily he answers with a groan More sharp to me than spurring to his side For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind 51 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of perfectst love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went wilfulslow Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go 52 So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure The which he will not every hour survey For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like stones of worth they thinly placed are Or captain jewels in the carcanet So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hideTo make some special instant specialblest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope Being had to triumph being lacked to hope 53 What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe Adonis and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you On Helens cheek all art of beauty set And you in Grecian tires are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty doth appear And you in every blessed shape we know In all external grace you have some part But you like none none you for constant heart 54 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly When summers breath their masked buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made And so of you beauteous and lovely youth When that shall fade my verse distills your truth 55 Not marble nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time When wasteful war shall statues overturn And broils root out the work of masonry Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory Gainst death and alloblivious enmity Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom So till the judgement that yourself arise You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes 56 Sweet love renew thy force be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite Which but today by feeding is allayed Tomorrow sharpened in his former might So love be thou although today thou fill Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness Tomorrow see again and do not kill The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore where two contracted new Come daily to the banks that when they see Return of love more blest may be the view Or call it winter which being full of care Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare 57 Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend Nor services to do till you require Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be or your affairs suppose But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are how happy you make those So true a fool is love that in your will Though you do any thing he thinks no ill 58 That god forbid that made me first your slave I should in thought control your times of pleasure Or at your hand th account of hours to crave Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure O let me suffer being at your beck Th imprisoned absence of your liberty And patience tame to sufferance bide each check Without accusing you of injury Be where you list your charter is so strong That you yourself may privilage your time To what you will to you it doth belong Yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime I am to wait though waiting so be hell Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well 59 If there be nothing new but that which is Hath been before how are our brains beguiled Which labouring for invention bear amiss The second burthen of a former child O that record could with a backward look Even of five hundred courses of the sun Show me your image in some antique book Since mind at first in character was done That I might see what the old world could say To this composed wonder of your frame Whether we are mended or whether better they Or whether revolution be the same O sure I am the wits of former days To subjects worse have given admiring praise 60 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore So do our minutes hasten to their end Each changing place with that which goes before In sequent toil all forwards do contend Nativity once in the main of light Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight And Time that gave doth now his gift confound Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beautys brow Feeds on the rarities of natures truth And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand 61 Is it thy will thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken While shadows like to thee do mock my sight Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry To find out shames and idle hours in me The scope and tenure of thy jealousy O no thy love though much is not so great It is my love that keeps mine eye awake Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat To play the watchman ever for thy sake For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere From me far off with others all too near 62 Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye And all my soul and all my every part And for this sin there is no remedy It is so grounded inward in my heart Methinks no face so gracious is as mine No shape so true no truth of such account And for my self mine own worth do define As I all other in all worths surmount But when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity Mine own selflove quite contrary I read Self so selfloving were iniquity Tis thee myself that for myself I praise Painting my age with beauty of thy days 63 Against my love shall be as I am now With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn Hath travelled on to ages steepy night And all those beauties whereof now hes king Are vanishing or vanished out of sight Stealing away the treasure of his spring For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding ages cruel knife That he shall never cut from memory My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life His beauty shall in these black lines be seen And they shall live and he in them still green 64 When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced The richproud cost of outworn buried age When sometime lofty towers I see downrased And brass eternal slave to mortal rage When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore And the firm soil win of the watery main Increasing store with loss and loss with store When I have seen such interchange of State Or state it self confounded to decay Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate That Time will come and take my love away This thought is as a death which cannot choose But weep to have that which it fears to lose 65 Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea But sad mortality oersways their power How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea Whose action is no stronger than a flower O how shall summers honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of battring days When rocks impregnable are not so stout Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays O fearful meditation where alack Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid O none unless this miracle have might That in black ink my love may still shine bright 66 Tired with all these for restful death I cry As to behold desert a beggar born And needy nothing trimmed in jollity And purest faith unhappily forsworn And gilded honour shamefully misplaced And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted And right perfection wrongfully disgraced And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tonguetied by authority And folly doctorlike controlling skill And simple truth miscalled simplicity And captive good attending captain ill Tired with all these from these would I be gone Save that to die I leave my love alone 67 Ah wherefore with infection should he live And with his presence grace impiety That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace it self with his society Why should false painting imitate his cheek And steal dead seeming of his living hue Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow since his rose is true Why should he live now nature bankrupt is Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins For she hath no exchequer now but his And proud of many lives upon his gains O him she stores to show what wealth she had In days long since before these last so bad 68 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn When beauty lived and died as flowers do now Before these bastard signs of fair were born Or durst inhabit on a living brow Before the golden tresses of the dead The right of sepulchres were shorn away To live a second life on second head Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay In him those holy antique hours are seen Without all ornament it self and true Making no summer of anothers green Robbing no old to dress his beauty new And him as for a map doth Nature store To show false Art what beauty was of yore 69 Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned But those same tongues that give thee so thine own In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown They look into the beauty of thy mind And that in guess they measure by thy deeds Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds But why thy odour matcheth not thy show The soil is this that thou dost common grow 70 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect For slanders mark was ever yet the fair The ornament of beauty is suspect A crow that flies in heavens sweetest airSo thou be good slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater being wooed of time For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love And thou presentst a pure unstained prime Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days Either not assailed or victor being charged Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise To tie up envy evermore enlarged If some suspect of ill masked not thy show Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 71 No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell Nay if you read this line remember not The hand that writ it for I love you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot If thinking on me then should make you woe O if I say you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay Do not so much as my poor name rehearse But let your love even with my life decay Lest the wise world should look into your moan And mock you with me after I am gone 72 O lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love After my death dear love forget me quite For you in me can nothing worthy prove Unless you would devise some virtuous lie To do more for me than mine own desert And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart O lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue My name be buried where my body is And live no more to shame nor me nor you For I am shamed by that which I bring forth And so should you to love things nothing worth 73 That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves or none or few do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west Which by and by black night doth take away Deaths second self that seals up all in rest In me thou seest the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie As the deathbed whereon it must expire Consumed with that which it was nourished by This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong To love that well which thou must leave ere long 74 But be contented when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away My life hath in this line some interest Which for memorial still with thee shall stay When thou reviewest this thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee The earth can have but earth which is his due My spirit is thine the better part of me So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life The prey of worms my body being dead The coward conquest of a wretchs knife Too base of thee to be remembered The worth of that is that which it contains And that is this and this with thee remains 75 So are you to my thoughts as food to life Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground And for the peace of you I hold such strife As twixt a miser and his wealth is found Now proud as an enjoyer and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure Now counting best to be with you alone Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure Sometime all full with feasting on your sight And by and by clean starved for a look Possessing or pursuing no delight Save what is had or must from you be took Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day Or gluttoning on all or all away 76 Why is my verse so barren of new pride So far from variation or quick change Why with the time do I not glance aside To newfound methods and to compounds strange Why write I still all one ever the same And keep invention in a noted weed That every word doth almost tell my name Showing their birth and where they did proceed O know sweet love I always write of you And you and love are still my argument So all my best is dressing old words new Spending again what is already spent For as the sun is daily new and old So is my love still telling what is told 77 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear And of this book this learning mayst thou taste The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show Of mouthed graves will give thee memory Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know Times thievish progress to eternity Look what thy memory cannot contain Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find Those children nursed delivered from thy brain To take a new acquaintance of thy mind These offices so oft as thou wilt look Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book 78 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly Have added feathers to the learneds wing And given grace a double majesty Yet be most proud of that which I compile Whose influence is thine and born of thee In others works thou dost but mend the style And arts with thy sweet graces graced be But thou art all my art and dost advance As high as learning my rude ignorance 79 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid My verse alone had all thy gentle grace But now my gracious numbers are decayed And my sick muse doth give an other place I grant sweet love thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of and pays it thee again He lends thee virtue and he stole that word From thy behaviour beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek he can afford No praise to thee but what in thee doth live Then thank him not for that which he doth say Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay 80 O how I faint when I of you do write Knowing a better spirit doth use your name And in the praise thereof spends all his might To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame But since your worth wide as the ocean is The humble as the proudest sail doth bear My saucy bark inferior far to his On your broad main doth wilfully appear Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat He of tall building and of goodly pride Then if he thrive and I be cast away The worst was this my love was my decay 81 Or I shall live your epitaph to make Or you survive when I in earth am rotten From hence your memory death cannot take Although in me each part will be forgotten Your name from hence immortal life shall have Though I once gone to all the world must die The earth can yield me but a common grave When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie Your monument shall be my gentle verse Which eyes not yet created shall oerread And tongues to be your being shall rehearse When all the breathers of this world are dead You still shall live such virtue hath my pen Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men 82 I grant thou wert not married to my muse And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject blessing every book Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue Finding thy worth a limit past my praise And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days And do so love yet when they have devised What strained touches rhetoric can lend Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized In true plain words by thy truetelling friend And their gross painting might be better used Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused 83 I never saw that you did painting need And therefore to your fair no painting set I found or thought I found you did exceed That barren tender of a poets debt And therefore have I slept in your report That you yourself being extant well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow This silence for my sin you did impute Which shall be most my glory being dumb For I impair not beauty being mute When others would give life and bring a tomb There lives more life in one of your fair eyes Than both your poets can in praise devise 84 Who is it that says most which can say more Than this rich praise that you alone are you In whose confine immured is the store Which should example where your equal grew Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory But he that writes of you if he can tell That you are you so dignifies his story Let him but copy what in you is writ Not making worse what nature made so clear And such a counterpart shall fame his wit Making his style admired every where You to your beauteous blessings add a curse Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse 85 My tonguetied muse in manners holds her still While comments of your praise richly compiled Reserve their character with golden quill And precious phrase by all the Muses filed I think good thoughts whilst other write good words And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen To every hymn that able spirit affords In polished form of well refined pen Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true And to the most of praise add something more But that is in my thought whose love to you Though words come hindmost holds his rank before Then others for the breath of words respect Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect 86 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse Bound for the prize of all too precious you That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead No neither he nor his compeers by night Giving him aid my verse astonished He nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence As victors of my silence cannot boast I was not sick of any fear from thence But when your countenance filled up his line Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine 87 Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing And like enough thou knowst thy estimate The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing My bonds in thee are all determinate For how do I hold thee but by thy granting And for that riches where is my deserving The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting And so my patent back again is swerving Thyself thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking So thy great gift upon misprision growingComes home again on better judgement making Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter In sleep a king but waking no such matter 88 When thou shalt be disposed to set me light And place my merit in the eye of scorn Upon thy side against my self Ill fight And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn With mine own weakness being best acquainted Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted That thou in losing me shalt win much glory And I by this will be a gainer too For bending all my loving thoughts on thee The injuries that to my self I do Doing thee vantage doublevantage me Such is my love to thee I so belong That for thy right my self will bear all wrong 89 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault And I will comment upon that offence Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt Against thy reasons making no defence Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill To set a form upon desired change As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will I will acquaintance strangle and look strange Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell Lest I too much profane should do it wrong And haply of our old acquaintance tell For thee against my self Ill vow debate For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate 90 Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow And do not drop in for an afterloss Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow Come in the rearward of a conquered woe Give not a windy night a rainy morrow To linger out a purposed overthrow If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last When other petty griefs have done their spite But in the onset come so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortunes might And other strains of woe which now seem woe Compared with loss of thee will not seem so 91 Some glory in their birth some in their skill Some in their wealth some in their bodys force Some in their garments though newfangled ill Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure Wherein it finds a joy above the rest But these particulars are not my measure All these I better in one general best Thy love is better than high birth to me Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs Of more delight than hawks and horses be And having thee of all mens pride I boast Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take All this away and me most wretched make 92 But do thy worst to steal thyself away For term of life thou art assured mine And life no longer than thy love will stay For it depends upon that love of thine Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs When in the least of them my life hath end I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humour doth depend Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie O what a happy title do I find Happy to have thy love happy to die But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not 93 So shall I live supposing thou art true Like a deceived husband so loves face May still seem love to me though altered new Thy looks with me thy heart in other place For there can live no hatred in thine eye Therefore in that I cannot know thy change In manys looks the false hearts history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show 94 They that have power to hurt and will do none That do not do the thing they most do show Who moving others are themselves as stone Unmoved cold and to temptation slow They rightly do inherit heavens graces And husband natures riches from expense They are the lords and owners of their faces Others but stewards of their excellence The summers flower is to the summer sweet Though to it self it only live and die But if that flower with base infection meet The basest weed outbraves his dignity For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 95 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which like a canker in the fragrant rose Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose That tongue that tells the story of thy days Making lascivious comments on thy sport Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise Naming thy name blesses an ill report O what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee Where beautys veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see Take heed dear heart of this large privilege The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge 96 Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport Both grace and faults are loved of more and less Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteemed So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated and for true things deemed How many lambs might the stern wolf betray If like a lamb he could his looks translate How many gazers mightst thou lead away If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state But do not so I love thee in such sort As thou being mine mine is thy good report 97 How like a winter hath my absence been From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year What freezings have I felt what dark days seen What old Decembers bareness everywhere And yet this time removed was summers time The teeming autumn big with rich increase Bearing the wanton burden of the prime Like widowed wombs after their lords decease Yet this abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit For summer and his pleasures wait on thee And thou away the very birds are mute Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer That leaves look pale dreading the winters near 98 From you have I been absent in the spring When proudpied April dressed in all his trim Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue Could make me any summers story tell Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew Nor did I wonder at the lilys white Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose They were but sweet but figures of delight Drawn after you you pattern of all those Yet seemed it winter still and you away As with your shadow I with these did play 99 The forward violet thus did I chide Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells If not from my loves breath The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed The lily I condemned for thy hand And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair The roses fearfully on thorns did stand One blushing shame another white despair A third nor red nor white had stoln of both And to his robbery had annexed thy breath But for his theft in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death More flowers I noted yet I none could see But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee 100 Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long To speak of that which gives thee all thy might Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem In gentle numbers time so idly spent Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem And gives thy pen both skill and argument Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey If time have any wrinkle graven there If any be a satire to decay And make times spoils despised everywhere Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife 101 O truant Muse what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed Both truth and beauty on my love depends So dost thou too and therein dignified Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay But best is best if never intermixed Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be praised of ages yet to be Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he shows now 102 My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming I love not less though less the show appear That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming The owners tongue doth publish every where Our love was new and then but in the spring When I was wont to greet it with my lays As Philomel in summers front doth sing And stops her pipe in growth of riper days Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night But that wild music burthens every bough And sweets grown common lose their dear delight Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue Because I would not dull you with my song 103 Alack what poverty my muse brings forth That having such a scope to show her pride The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace Were it not sinful then striving to mend To mar the subject that before was well For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell And more much more than in my verse can sit Your own glass shows you when you look in it 104 To me fair friend you never can be old For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such seems your beauty still three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers pride Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was beautys summer dead105 Let not my love be called idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my songs and praises be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined One thing expressing leaves out difference Fair kind and true is all my argument Fair kind and true varying to other words And in this change is my invention spent Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords Fair kind and true have often lived alone Which three till now never kept seat in one 106 When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they looked but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we which now behold these present days Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 107 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come Can yet the lease of my true love control Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured And the sad augurs mock their own presage Incertainties now crown themselves assured And peace proclaims olives of endless age Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes And thou in this shalt find thy monument When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 108 Whats in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit Whats new to speak what now to register That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine I must each day say oer the very same Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name So that eternal love in loves fresh case Weighs not the dust and injury of age Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place But makes antiquity for aye his page Finding the first conceit of love there bred Where time and outward form would show it dead 109 O never say that I was false of heart Though absence seemed my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that travels I return again Just to the time not with the time exchanged So that my self bring water for"

follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believst no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath AARON What if I do not As indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sisters tongue and ravished her And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest LUCIUS O detestable villain callst thou that trimming AARON Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons heads Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the empress of this sport She sounded almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses GOTH What canst thou say all this and never blush AARON Ay like a black dog as the saying is LUCIUS Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds AARON Ay that I had not done a thousand more Even now I curse the day and yet I think Few come within the compass of my curse Wherein I did not some notorious ill As kill a man or else devise his death Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it Accuse some innocent and forswear myself Set deadly enmity between two friends Make poor mens cattle break their necks Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night And bid the owners quench them with their tears Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves And set them upright at their dear friends door Even when their sorrows almost was forgot And on their skins as on the bark of trees Have with my knife carved in Roman letters Let not your sorrow die though I am dead But I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand more LUCIUS Bring down the devil for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presently AARON If there be devils would I were a devil To live and burn in everlasting fire So I might have your company in hell But to torment you with my bitter tongue LUCIUS Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more Enter Aemilius GOTH My lord there is a messenger from Rome Desires to be admitted to your presence LUCIUS Let him come near Welcome Aemilius Whats the news from Rome AEMILIUS Lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths The Roman emperor greets you all by me And for he understands you are in arms He

bleed He kills Saturninus Theres meed for meed death for a deadly deed A great tumult Lucius Marcus and others go aloft to the upper stageMARCUS You sadfaced men people and sons of Rome By uproar severed as a flight of fowl Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts O let me teach you how to knit again This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf These broken limbs again into one body Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to Like a forlorn and desperate castaway Do shameful execution on herself But if my frosty signs and chaps of age Grave witnesses of true experience Cannot induce you to attend my words Speak Romes dear friend to Lucius as erst our ancestor When with his solemn tongue he did discourse To lovesick Didos sad attending ear The story of that baleful burning night When subtle Greeks surprised King Priams Troy Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears Or who hath brought the fatal engine in That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound My heart is not compact of flint nor steel Nor can I utter all our bitter grief But floods of tears will drown my oratory And break my utterance even in the time When it should move you to attend me most And force you to commiseration Heres Romes young captain let him tell the tale While I stand by and weep to hear him speak LUCIUS Then noble auditory be it known to you That Chiron and the damned Demetrius Were they that murdered our emperors brother And they it were that ravished our sister For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded Our fathers tears despised and basely cozened Of that true hand that fought Romes quarrel out And sent her enemies unto the grave Lastly myself unkindly banished The gates shut on me and turned weeping out To beg relief among Romes enemies Who drowned their enmity in my true tears And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend I am the turnedforth be it known to you That have preserved her welfare in my blood And from her bosom took the enemys point Sheathing the steel in my adventrous body Alas you know I am no vaunter I My scars can witness dumb although they are That my report is just and full of truth But soft methinks I do digress too much Citing my worthless praise O pardon me For when no friends are by men praise themselves MARCUS Now is my turn to speak Behold the child Of this was Tamora delivered The issue of an irreligious Moor Chief architect and plotter of these woes The villain is alive in Titus house And as he is to witness this is true Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge These wrongs unspeakable past patience Or more than any living man could bear Now have you heard the truth What say you Romans Have we done aught amiss Show us wherein And from the place where you behold us pleading The poor remainder of Andronici Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls And make a mutual closure of our house Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall Lo

wicked life Exeunt Attendants Lucius and Marcus come down from the upper stage ROMANS Lucius all hail Romes gracious governor LUCIUS Thanks gentle Romans May I govern so To heal Romes harms and wipe away her woe But gentle people give me aim awhile For nature puts me to a heavy task Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk He kisses Titus O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face The last true duties of thy noble son MARCUS Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips O were the sum of these that I should pay Countless and infinite yet would I pay them LUCIUS Come hither boy come come and learn of us To melt in showers Thy grandsire loved thee well Many a time he danced thee on his knee Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow Many a story hath he told to thee And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind And talk of them when he was dead and gone MARCUS How many thousand times hath these poor lips When they were living warmed themselves on thine O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss Bid him farewell commit him to the grave Do them that kindness and take leave of them YOUNG LUCIUS O grandsire grandsire een with all my heart Would I were dead so you did live again O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth Reenter Attendants with Aaron AEMILIUS You sad Andronici have done with woes Give sentence on the execrable wretch That hath been breeder of these dire events LUCIUS Set him breastdeep in earth and famish him There let him stand and rave and cry for food If anyone relieves or pities him For the offence he dies This is our doom Some stay to see him fastened in the earth AARON Ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb I am no baby I that with base prayers I should repent the evils I have done Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did Would I perform if I might have my will If one good deed in all my life I did I do repent it from my very soul LUCIUS Some loving friends convey the emperor hence And give him burial in his fathers grave My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our households monument As for that ravenous tiger Tamora No funeral rite nor man in mournful weed No mournful bell shall ring her burial But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey Her life was beastly and devoid of pity And being dead let birds on her take pity Exeunt TROILUS AND CRESSIDA Contents ACT I Prologue Scene I Troy Before Priams palace Scene II Troy A street Scene III The Grecian

Desdemona is directly in love with him RODERIGO With him Why tis not possible IAGO Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed And what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none A slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after A pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already RODERIGO I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition IAGO Blest figs end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that RODERIGO Yes that I did But that was but courtesy IAGO Lechery by this hand An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embracd together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight For the command Ill layt upon you Cassio knows you not Ill not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister RODERIGO Well IAGO Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell RODERIGO Adieu Exit IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evend with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash For his quick hunting stand the putting on Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness Tis here but yet confusd Knaverys plain face is never seen till usd Exit SCENE II A street Enter Othellos Herald with a proclamation HERALD It is Othellos pleasure our noble and

often thus IAGO Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep Hell watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle MONTANO It were well The general were put in mind of it Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils is not this true Enter Roderigo IAGO Aside to him How now Roderigo I pray you after the lieutenant go Exit Roderigo MONTANO And tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity It were an honest action to say so To the Moor IAGO Not I for this

Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety What is the matter masters Honest Iago that looks dead with grieving Speak who began this On thy love I charge thee IAGO I do not know Friends all but now even now In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed and then but now As if some planet had unwitted men Swords out and tilting one at others breast In opposition bloody I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it OTHELLO How comes it Michael you are thus forgot CASSIO I pray you pardon me I cannot speak OTHELLO Worthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure whats the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler Give me answer to it MONTANO Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger Your officer Iago can inform you While I spare speech which something now offends me Of all that I do know nor know I aught By me thats said or done amiss this night Unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us OTHELLO Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way Zounds if I stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approvd in this offence Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety Tis monstrous Iago who begant MONTANO If partially affind or leagud in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier IAGO Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determind sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamour as it so fell out The town might fall in fright he swift of foot Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I neer might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass OTHELLO I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine Enter Desdemona attended Look if my gentle love be not raisd up Ill make thee an example DESDEMONA Whats the matter OTHELLO Alls well now sweeting come away to bed Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon Lead him off Montano is led off Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted Come Desdemona tis the soldiers life To have their balmy slumbers wakd with strife Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio IAGO What are you hurt lieutenant CASSIO Ay past all surgery IAGO Marry Heaven forbid CASSIO Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation IAGO As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you CASSIO I know not IAGO Ist possible CASSIO I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains That we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beastsIAGO Why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself IAGO Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good CASSIO I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblessd and the ingredient is a devil IAGO Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love you CASSIO I have well approved it sirI drunk IAGO You or any man living may be drunk at a time man Ill tell you what you shall do Our generals wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her Importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before CASSIO You advise me well IAGO I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness CASSIO I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here IAGO You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch CASSIO Good night honest Iago Exit IAGO And whats he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit Shes framd as fruitful As the free elements And then for her To win the Moor weret to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetterd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now for whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor Ill pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her bodys lust And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all Enter Roderigo How now Roderigo RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice IAGO How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time Doest not go well Cassio hath beaten thee And thou by that small hurt hast cashierd Cassio Though other things grow fair against the sun Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe Content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee gone Exit Roderigo Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress Ill set her on Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife Ay thats the way Dull not device by coldness and delay Exit ACT III SCENE I Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Cassio and some Musicians CASSIO Masters play here I will content your pains Something thats brief and bid Good morrow general Music Enter

entreats her a little favour of speech Wilt thou do this CLOWN She is stirring sir if she will stir hither I shall seem to notify unto her CASSIO Do good my friend Exit Clown Enter Iago In happy time Iago IAGO You have not been abed then CASSIO Why no The day had broke Before we parted I have made bold Iago To send in to your wife My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access IAGO Ill send her to you presently And Ill devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way that your converse and business May be more free CASSIO I humbly thank you fort Exit Iago I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest Enter Emilia EMILIA Good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again CASSIO Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone EMILIA Pray you come in I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely CASSIO I am much bound to you Exeunt SCENE II Cyprus A Room in the Castle

love my lord You have known him long and be you well assurd He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distance CASSIO Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstance That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service DESDEMONA Do not doubt that Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee If I do vow a friendship Ill perform it To the last article My lord shall never rest Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift Ill intermingle everything he does With Cassios suit Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away Enter Othello and Iago EMILIA Madam here comes my lord CASSIO Madam Ill take my leave DESDEMONA Why stay and hear me speak CASSIO Madam not now I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes DESDEMONA Well do your discretion Exit Cassio IAGO Ha I like not that OTHELLO What dost thou say IAGO Nothing my lord or ifI know not what OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife IAGO Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike Seeing you coming OTHELLO I do believe twas he DESDEMONA How now my lord I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure OTHELLO Who ist you mean DESDEMONA Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back OTHELLO Went he hence now DESDEMONA Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him back OTHELLO Not now sweet Desdemon some other time DESDEMONA But shallt be shortly OTHELLO The sooner sweet for you DESDEMONA"

And bring me their opinions of success SERVANT I will my lord Exit Enter Calphurnia CALPHURNIA What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth You shall not stir out of your house today CAESAR Caesar shall forth The things that threatend me Neer lookd but on my back when they shall see The face of Caesar they are vanished CALPHURNIA Caesar I never stood on ceremonies Yet now they fright me There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch A lioness hath whelped in the streets And graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol The noise of battle hurtled in the air Horses did neigh and dying men did groan And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets O Caesar these things are beyond all use And I do fear them CAESAR What can be avoided Whose end is purposd by the mighty gods Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar CALPHURNIA When beggars die there are no comets seen The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes CAESAR Cowards die many times before their deaths The valiant never taste of death but once Of all the wonders that I yet have heard It seems to me most strange that men should fear Seeing that death a necessary end Will come when it will come Enter Servant What say the augurers SERVANT They would not have you to stir forth today Plucking the entrails of an offering forth They could not find a heart within the

satisfaction Because I love you I will let you know Calphurnia here my wife stays me at home She dreamt tonight she saw my statue Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent and on her knee Hath beggd that I will stay at home today DECIUS This dream is all amiss interpreted It was a vision fair and fortunate Your statue spouting blood in many pipes In which so many smiling Romans bathd Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall press For tinctures stains relics and cognizance This by Calphurnias dream is signified CAESAR And this way have you well expounded it DECIUS I have when you

Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war All pity chokd with custom of fell deeds And Caesars spirit ranging for revenge With Ate by his side come hot from Hell Shall in these confines with a monarchs voice Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial Enter a Servant You serve Octavius Caesar do you not SERVANT I do Mark

be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesars to him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all free men As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I slew him There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If

come to bury Caesar not to praise him The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interred with their bones So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious If it were so it was a grievous fault And grievously hath Caesar answerd it Here under leave of Brutus and the rest For Brutus is an honourable man So are they all all honourable men Come I to speak in Caesars funeral He was my friend faithful and just to me But Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honourable man He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill Did this in Caesar seem ambitious When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept Ambition should be made of sterner stuff Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honourable man You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And sure he is an honourable man I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke But here I am to speak what I do know You all did love him once not without cause What cause withholds you then to mourn for him O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts And men have lost their reason Bear with me My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar And I must pause till it come back to me FIRST CITIZEN Methinks there is much reason in his sayings SECOND CITIZEN If thou consider rightly of the matter Caesar has had great wrong THIRD CITIZEN Has he masters I fear there will a worse come in his place FOURTH CITIZEN Markd ye his words He would not take the crown Therefore tis certain he was not ambitious FIRST CITIZEN If it be found so some will dear abide it SECOND CITIZEN Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping THIRD CITIZEN Theres not a nobler man in Rome than Antony FOURTH CITIZEN Now mark him he begins again to speak ANTONY But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world now lies he there And none so poor to do him reverence O masters If I were disposd to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong Who you all know are honourable men I will not do them wrong I rather choose To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you Than I will wrong such honourable men But heres a parchment with the seal of Caesar I found it in his closet tis his will Let but the commons hear this testament Which pardon me I do not mean to read And they would go and kiss dead Caesars wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood Yea beg a hair of him for memory And dying mention it

place ran Cassius dagger through See what a rent the envious Casca made Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabbd And as he pluckd his cursed steel away Mark how the blood of Caesar followd it As rushing out of doors to be resolvd If Brutus so unkindly knockd or no For Brutus as you know was Caesars angel Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar lovd him This was the most unkindest cut of all For when the noble Caesar saw him stab Ingratitude more strong than traitors arms Quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart And in his mantle muffling up his face Even at the base of Pompeys statue Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell O what a fall was there my countrymen Then I and you and all of us fell down Whilst bloody treason flourishd over us O now you weep and I perceive you feel The dint of pity These are gracious drops Kind souls what weep you when you but behold Our Caesars vesture wounded Look you here Here is himself marrd as you see with traitors FIRST CITIZEN O

wise and honourable And will no doubt with reasons answer you I come not friends to steal away your hearts I am no orator as Brutus is But as you know me all a plain blunt man That love my friend and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him For I have neither wit nor words nor worth Action nor utterance nor the power of speech To stir mens blood I only speak right on I tell you that which you yourselves do know Show you sweet Caesars wounds poor poor dumb mouths And bid them speak for me But were I Brutus And Brutus Antony there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny CITIZENS Well mutiny FIRST CITIZEN Well burn the house of Brutus THIRD CITIZEN Away then come seek the conspirators ANTONY Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak CITIZENS Peace ho Hear Antony most noble Antony ANTONY Why friends you go to do you know not what Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves Alas you know not I must tell you then You have forgot the will I told you of CITIZENS Most true the willlets stay and hear the will ANTONY Here is the will and under Caesars seal

desire us tot PRINCESS No to the death we will not move a foot Nor to their penned speech render we no grace But while tis spoke each turn away her face BOYET Why that contempt will kill the speakers heart And quite divorce his memory from his part PRINCESS Therefore I do it and I make no doubt The rest will neer come in if he be out Theres no such sport as sport by sport oerthrown To make theirs

LAWRENCE You say you do not know the ladys mind Uneven is the course I like it not PARIS Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death And therefore have I little talkd of love For Venus smiles not in a house of tears Now sir her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears Which too much minded by herself alone May be put from her by society Now do you know the reason of this haste FRIAR LAWRENCE Aside I would I knew not why it should be slowd Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell Enter

Wednesday is tomorrow Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber Take thou this vial being then in bed And this distilled liquor drink thou off When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse Shall keep his native progress but surcease No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes thy eyes windows fall Like death when he shuts up the day of life Each part deprivd of supple government Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death And in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours And then awake as from a pleasant sleep Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead Then as the manner of our country is In thy best robes uncoverd on the bier Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie In the meantime against thou shalt awake Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift And hither shall he come and he and I Will watch thy waking and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua And this shall free thee from
