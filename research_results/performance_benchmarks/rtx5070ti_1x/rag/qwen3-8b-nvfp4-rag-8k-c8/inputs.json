Octavius ANTONY In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words Witness the hole you made in Caesars heart Crying Long live Hail Caesar CASSIUS Antony The posture of your blows are yet unknown But for your words they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless ANTONY Not stingless too BRUTUS O yes and soundless too For you have stoln their buzzing Antony And very wisely threat before you sting ANTONY Villains you did not so when your vile daggers Hackd one another in the sides of Caesar You showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds And bowd like bondmen kissing Caesars feet Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind Struck Caesar on the neck O you flatterers CASSIUS Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruld OCTAVIUS Come come the cause If arguing makes us sweat The proof of it will turn to redder drops Look I draw a sword against conspirators When think you that the sword goes up again Never till Caesars three and thirty wounds Be well avengd or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors BRUTUS Caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands Unless thou bringst them with thee OCTAVIUS So I hope I was not born to die on Brutus sword BRUTUS O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain Young man thou couldst not die more honourable CASSIUS A peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour Joind with a masker and a reveller ANTONY Old Cassius still OCTAVIUS Come Antony away Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth If you dare fight today come to the field If not when you have stomachs Exeunt Octavius Antony and their Army CASSIUS Why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark The storm is up and all is on the hazard BRUTUS Ho Lucilius Hark a word with you LUCILIUS My lord Brutus and Lucilius talk apart CASSIUS Messala MESSALA What says my General CASSIUS Messala This is my birthday as this very day Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala Be thou my witness that against my will As Pompey was am I compelld to set Upon one battle all our liberties You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage Coming from Sardis on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands Who to Philippi here consorted us This morning are they fled away and gone And in their steads do ravens crows and kites Fly oer our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey their shadows seem A canopy most fatal under which Our army lies ready to give up the ghost MESSALA Believe not so CASSIUS I but believe it partly For I am fresh of spirit and resolvd To meet all perils very constantly BRUTUS Even so Lucilius CASSIUS Now most noble Brutus The gods today stand friendly that we may Lovers in peace lead on our days to age But since the affairs of men rest still incertain Lets reason with the worst that may befall If we do lose this battle then is this The very last time we shall speak together What are you then determined to do BRUTUS Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself I know not how But I do find it cowardly and vile For fear of what might fall so to prevent The time of life arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below CASSIUS Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome BRUTUS No Cassius no think not thou noble Roman That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome He bears too great a mind But this same day Must end that work the Ides of March begun And whether we shall meet again I know not Therefore our everlasting farewell take For ever and for ever farewell Cassius If we do meet again why we shall smile If not why then this parting was well made CASSIUS For ever and for ever farewell Brutus If we do meet again well smile indeed If not tis true this parting was well made BRUTUS Why then lead on O that a man might know The end of this days business ere it come But it sufficeth that the day will end And then the end is known Come ho away Exeunt SCENE II The same The field of battle Alarum Enter Brutus and Messala BRUTUS Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side Loud alarum Let them set on at once for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius wing And sudden push gives them the overthrow Ride ride Messala let them all come down Exeunt SCENE III Another part of the field Alarum Enter Cassius and Titinius CASSIUS O look Titinius look the villains fly Myself have to mine own turnd enemy This ensign here of mine was turning back I slew the coward and did take it from him TITINIUS O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early Who having some advantage on Octavius Took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil Whilst we by Antony are all enclosd Enter Pindarus PINDARUS Fly further off my lord fly further off Mark Antony is in your tents my lord Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off CASSIUS This hill is far enough Look look Titinius Are those my tents where I perceive the fire TITINIUS They are my lord CASSIUS Titinius if thou lovest me Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again that I may rest assurd Whether yond troops are friend or enemy TITINIUS I will be here again even with a thought Exit CASSIUS Go Pindarus get higher on that hill My sight was ever thick Regard Titinius And tell me what thou notest about the field Pindarus goes up This day I breathed first Time is come round And where I did begin there shall I end My life is run his compass Sirrah what news PINDARUS Above O my lord CASSIUS What news PINDARUS Above Titinius is enclosed round about With horsemen that make to him on the spur Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too Hes taen Shout And hark they shout for joyCASSIUS Come down behold no more O coward that I am to live so long To see my best friend taen before my face Pindarus descends Come hither sirrah In Parthia did I take thee prisoner And then I swore thee saving of thy life That whatsoever I did bid thee do Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath Now be a freeman and with this good sword That ran through Caesars bowels search this bosom Stand not to answer Here take thou the hilts And when my face is coverd as tis now Guide thou the swordCaesar thou art revengd Even with the sword that killd thee Dies PINDARUS So I am free yet would not so have been Durst I have done my will O Cassius Far from this country Pindarus shall run Where never Roman shall take note of him Exit Enter Titinius with Messala MESSALA It is but change Titinius for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus power As Cassius legions are by Antony TITINIUS These tidings would well comfort Cassius MESSALA Where did you leave him TITINIUS All disconsolate With Pindarus his bondman on this hill MESSALA Is not that he that lies upon the ground TITINIUS He lies not like the living O my heart MESSALA Is not that he TITINIUS No this was he Messala But Cassius is no more O setting sun As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night So in his red blood Cassius day is set The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done Mistrust of my success hath done this deed MESSALA Mistrust of good success hath done this deed O hateful Error Melancholys child Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not O Error soon conceivd Thou never comst unto a happy birth But killst the mother that engenderd thee TITINIUS What Pindarus where art thou Pindarus MESSALA Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his ears I may say thrusting it For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight TITINIUS Hie you Messala And I will seek for Pindarus the while Exit Messala Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius Did I not meet thy friends And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts Alas thou hast misconstrued everything But hold thee take this garland on thy brow Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I Will do his bidding Brutus come apace And see how I regarded Caius Cassius By your leave gods This is a Romans part Come Cassius sword and find Titinius heart Dies Alarum Enter Brutus Messala young Cato Strato Volumnius and Lucilius

abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails Low alarums CATO Brave Titinius Look whether he have not crownd dead Cassius BRUTUS Are yet two Romans living such as these The last of all the Romans fare thee well It is impossible that ever Rome Should breed thy fellow Friends I owe more tears To this dead man than you shall see me pay I shall find time Cassius I shall find time Come therefore and to Thassos send his body His funerals shall not be in our camp Lest it discomfort us Lucilius come And come young Cato let us to the field Labeo and Flavius set our battles on Tis three

bestow thy time with me STRATO Ay if Messala will prefer me to you OCTAVIUS Do so good Messala MESSALA How died my master Strato STRATO I held the sword and he did run on it MESSALA Octavius then take him to follow thee That did the latest service to my master ANTONY This was the noblest Roman of them all All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar He only in a general honest thought And common good to all made one of them His life was gentle and the elements So mixd in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world This was a man OCTAVIUS According

morning and at night And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice Twenty merchants The Duke himself and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture of justice and his bond JESSICA When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonios flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him And I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor Antonio PORTIA Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble BASSANIO The dearest friend to me the kindest man The best conditiond and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy PORTIA What sum owes he the Jew BASSANIO For me three thousand ducats PORTIA What no more Pay him six thousand and deface the bond Double six thousand and then treble that Before a friend of

absence of your lord But if you knew to whom you show this honour How true a gentleman you send relief How dear a lover of my lord your husband I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you PORTIA I never did repent for doing good Nor shall not now for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments of manners and of spirit Which makes me think that this Antonio Being the bosom lover of my lord Must needs be like my lord If it be so How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty This comes too near the praising of myself Therefore no more of it Hear other things Lorenzo I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lords return For mine own part I have toward heaven breathd a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation Only attended by Nerissa here Until her husband and my lords return There is a monastery two miles off And there we will abide I do desire you Not to deny this imposition The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon you LORENZO Madam with all my heart I shall obey you in all fair commands PORTIA My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself So fare you well till we shall meet again LORENZO Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you JESSICA I wish your ladyship all hearts content PORTIA I thank you for your wish and am well pleasd To wish it back on

thee any wager When we are both accoutered like young men Ill prove the prettier fellow of the two And wear my dagger with the braver grace And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies How honourable ladies sought my love Which I denying they fell sick and died I could not do withal Then Ill repent And wish for all that that I had not killd them And twenty of these puny lies Ill tell That men shall swear I have discontinued school About a twelvemonth I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks Which I will practise NERISSA Why shall we turn to men PORTIA Fie what a questions that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter But come Ill

I pray thee LAUNCELET Marry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the Jews daughter JESSICA That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me LAUNCELET Truly then I fear you are damnd both by father and mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother Well you are gone both ways JESSICA I shall be saved by my husband He hath made me a Christian LAUNCELET Truly the more to blame he we were Christians enow before een as many as could well live one by another This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money Enter Lorenzo JESSICA Ill tell my husband Launcelet what you say Here he comes LORENZO I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelet if you thus get my wife into corners JESSICA Nay you need not fear us Lorenzo Launcelet and I are out He tells me flatly theres no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jews daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork LORENZO I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negros belly The Moor is with child by you Launcelet LAUNCELET It is much that the Moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her for LORENZO How every fool can play upon the word I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots Go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner LAUNCELET That is done sir they have all stomachs LORENZO Goodly Lord what a witsnapper are you Then bid them prepare dinner LAUNCELET That is done too

instant I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner LAUNCELET For the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern Exit LORENZO O dear discretion how his words are suited The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words and I do know A many fools that stand in better place Garnishd like him that for a tricksy word Defy the matter How cheerst thou Jessica And now good sweet say thy opinion How dost thou like the Lord Bassanios wife JESSICA Past all expressing It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life For having such a blessing in his lady He finds the joys of heaven here on earth And if on earth he do not merit it In reason he should never come to heaven Why if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women And Portia one there must be something else Pawnd with the other for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow LORENZO Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife JESSICA Nay but ask my opinion too of that LORENZO I will anon First let us go to dinner JESSICA Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach LORENZO No pray thee let it serve for tabletalk Then howsomeer thou speakst mong other things I

ANTONIO Ready so please your Grace DUKE I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer A stony adversary an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity void and empty From any dram of mercy ANTONIO I have heard Your Grace hath taen great pains to qualify His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envys reach I do oppose My patience to his fury and am armd To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his DUKE Go one and call the Jew into the court SALARINO He is ready at the door He comes my lord Enter Shylock DUKE Make room and let him stand before our face Shylock the world thinks and I think so too That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act and then tis thought Thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty And where thou now exacts the penalty Which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But touchd with human gentleness and love Forgive a moiety of the principal Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back Enow to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint From stubborn Turks and Tartars never traind To offices of tender courtesy We all expect a gentle answer Jew SHYLOCK I have possessd your Grace of what I purpose And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond If you deny it let the danger light Upon your charter and your citys freedom Youll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats Ill not answer that But say it is my humour Is it answerd What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleasd to give ten thousand ducats To have it band What are you answerd yet Some men there are love not a gaping pig Some that are mad if they behold a cat And others when the bagpipe sings i the nose Cannot contain their urine for affection Mistress of passion sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer As there is no firm reason to be renderd Why he cannot abide a gaping pigWhy he a harmless necessary cat Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend himself being offended So can I give no reason nor I will not More than a lodgd hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio that I follow thus A losing suit against him Are you answered BASSANIO This is no answer thou unfeeling man To excuse the current of thy cruelty SHYLOCK I am not bound to please thee with my answer BASSANIO Do all men kill the things they do not love SHYLOCK Hates any man the thing he would not kill BASSANIO Every offence is not a hate at first SHYLOCK What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ANTONIO I pray you think you question with the Jew You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven You may as well do anything most hard As seek to soften thatthan which whats harder His Jewish heart Therefore I do beseech you Make no moe offers use no farther means But with all brief and plain conveniency Let me have judgment and the Jew his will BASSANIO For thy three thousand ducats here is six SHYLOCK If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts and every part a ducat I would not draw them I would have my bond DUKE How shalt thou hope for mercy rendring none SHYLOCK What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong You have among you many a purchasd slave Which like your asses and your dogs and mules You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them Shall I say to you Let them be free marry them to your heirs Why sweat they under burdens Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasond with such viands You will answer The slaves are ours So do I answer you The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought tis mine and I will have it If you deny me fie upon your law There is no force in the decrees of Venice I stand for judgment Answer shall I have it DUKE Upon my power I may dismiss this court Unless Bellario a learned doctor Whom I have sent for to determine this Come here today SALARINO My lord here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor New come from Padua DUKE Bring us the letters Call the messenger BASSANIO Good cheer Antonio What man courage yet The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood ANTONIO I am a tainted wether of the flock Meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground and so let me You cannot better be employd Bassanio Than to live still and write mine epitaph Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyers clerk DUKE Came you from Padua from Bellario NERISSA From both my lord Bellario greets your Grace Presents a letter BASSANIO Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly SHYLOCK To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there GRATIANO Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew Thou makst thy knife keen But no metal can No not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee SHYLOCK No none that thou hast wit enough to make GRATIANO O be thou damnd inexecrable dog And for thy life let justice be accusd Thou almost makst me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men Thy currish spirit Governd a wolf who hangd for human slaughter Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infusd itself in thee for thy desires Are wolfish bloody starvd and ravenous SHYLOCK Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond Thou but offendst thy lungs to speak so loud Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall To cureless ruin I stand here for law DUKE This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court Where is he NERISSA He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether youll admit him DUKE OF VENICE With all my heart some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place Meantime the court shall hear Bellarios letter Reads Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome His name is Balthazar I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant We turnd oer many books together He is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Graces request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation You hear the learnd Bellario what he writes And here I take it is the doctor come Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws Give me your hand Come you from old Bellario PORTIA I did my lord DUKE You are welcome Take your place Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court PORTIA I am informed throughly of the cause Which is the merchant here And which the Jew DUKE Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth PORTIA Is your name Shylock SHYLOCK Shylock is my name PORTIA Of a strange nature is the suit you follow Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed To Antonio You stand within his danger do you not ANTONIO Ay so he says PORTIA Do you confess the bond ANTONIO I do PORTIA Then must the Jew be merciful SHYLOCK On what compulsion must I Tell me that PORTIA The quality of mercy is not straind It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath It is twice blest It blesseth him that gives and him that takes Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown His sceptre shows the force of temporal power The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings But mercy is above this sceptred sway It is enthroned in the hearts of kings It is an attribute to God himself And earthly power doth then show likest Gods When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew Though justice be thy plea consider this That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation We do pray for mercy And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there SHYLOCK My deeds upon my head I crave the law The penalty and forfeit of my bond PORTIA Is he not able to discharge the money BASSANIO Yes here I tender it for him in the court Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times oer On forfeit of my hands my head my heart If this will not suffice it must appear That malice bears down truth And I beseech you Wrest once the law to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And curb this cruel devil of his will PORTIA It must not be there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established Twill be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state It cannot be SHYLOCK A Daniel come to judgment Yea a Daniel O wise young judge how I do honour thee PORTIA I pray you let me look upon the bond SHYLOCK Here tis most reverend doctor here it is PORTIA Shylock theres thrice thy money offered thee SHYLOCK An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven Shall I lay perjury upon my soul No not for Venice PORTIA Why this bond is forfeit And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchants heart Be merciful Take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond SHYLOCK When it is paid according to the tenour It doth appear you are a worthy judge You know the law your exposition Hath been most sound I charge you by the law Whereof you are a welldeserving pillar Proceed to judgment By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me I stay here on my bond ANTONIO Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment PORTIA Why then thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knife SHYLOCK O noble judge O excellent young man PORTIA For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty Which here appeareth due upon the bond SHYLOCK Tis very true O wise and upright judge How much more elder art thou than thy looks PORTIA Therefore lay bare your bosom SHYLOCK Ay his breast So says the bond doth it not noble judge Nearest his heart those are the very words PORTIA It is so Are there balance here to weigh The flesh SHYLOCK I have them ready PORTIA Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death SHYLOCK Is it so nominated in the bond PORTIA It is not so expressd but what of that Twere good you do so much for charity SHYLOCK I cannot find it tis not in the bond PORTIA You merchant have you anything to say ANTONIO But little I am armd and well prepard Give me your hand Bassanio Fare you well Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty from which lingring penance Of such misery doth she cut me off Commend me to your honourable wife Tell her the process of Antonios end Say how I lovd you speak me fair in death And when the tale is told bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt For if the Jew do cut but deep enough Ill pay it instantly with all my heart BASSANIO Antonio I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself But life itself my wife and all the world Are not with me esteemd above thy life I would lose all ay sacrifice them all Here to this devil to deliver you PORTIA Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer GRATIANO I have a wife who I protest I love I would she were in heaven so she couldEntreat some power to change this currish Jew NERISSA Tis well you offer it behind her back The wish would make else an unquiet house SHYLOCK These be the Christian husbands I have a daughter Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband rather than a Christian We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence PORTIA A pound of that same merchants flesh is thine The court awards it and the law doth give it SHYLOCK Most rightful judge PORTIA And you must cut this flesh from off his breast The law allows it and the court awards it SHYLOCK Most learned judge A sentence Come prepare PORTIA Tarry a little there is something else This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood The words expressly are a pound of flesh Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice GRATIANO O upright judge Mark Jew O learned judge SHYLOCK Is that the law PORTIA Thyself shalt see the act For as thou urgest justice be assurd Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirst GRATIANO O learned judge Mark Jew a learned judge SHYLOCK I take this offer then Pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go BASSANIO Here is the money PORTIA Soft The Jew shall have all justice Soft no haste He shall have nothing but the penalty GRATIANO O Jew an upright judge a learned judge PORTIA Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh if thou takst more Or less than a just pound be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate GRATIANO A second Daniel a Daniel Jew Now infidel I have you on the hip PORTIA Why doth the Jew pause Take thy forfeiture SHYLOCK Give me my principal and let me go BASSANIO I have it ready for thee Here it is PORTIA He hath refusd it in the open court He shall have merely justice and his bond GRATIANO A Daniel still say I a second Daniel I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word SHYLOCK Shall I not have barely my principal PORTIA Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril Jew SHYLOCK Why then the devil give him good of it Ill stay no longer question PORTIA Tarry Jew The law hath yet another hold on you It is enacted in the laws of Venice If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offenders life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only gainst all other voice In which predicament I say thou standst For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant and thou hast incurrd The danger formerly by me rehearsd Down therefore and beg mercy of the Duke GRATIANO Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state Thou hast not left the value of a cord Therefore thou must be hangd at the states charge DUKE That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it For half thy wealth it is Antonios The other half comes to the general state Which humbleness may drive unto a fine PORTIA Ay for the state not for Antonio SHYLOCK Nay take my life and all pardon not that You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live PORTIA What mercy can you render him Antonio GRATIANO A halter gratis nothing else for Gods sake ANTONIO So please my lord the Duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter Two things provided more that for this favour He presently become a Christian The other that he do record a gift Here in the court of all he dies possessd Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter DUKE He shall do this or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here PORTIA Art thou contented Jew What dost thou say SHYLOCK I am content PORTIA Clerk draw a deed of gift SHYLOCK I pray you give me leave to go from hence I am not well send the deed after me And I will sign it DUKE Get thee gone but do it GRATIANO In christning shalt thou have two godfathers Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more To bring thee to the gallows not to the font Exit Shylock DUKE Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner PORTIA I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon I must away this night toward Padua And it is meet I presently set forth DUKE I am sorry that your leisure serves you not Antonio gratify this gentleman For in my mind you are much bound to him Exeunt Duke and his train BASSANIO Most worthy gentleman I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties in lieu whereof Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew We freely cope your courteous pains withal ANTONIO And stand indebted over and above In love and service to you evermore PORTIA He is well paid that is well satisfied And I delivering you am satisfied And therein do account myself well paid My mind was never yet more mercenary I pray you know me when we meet again I wish you well and so I take my leave BASSANIO Dear sir of force I must attempt you further Take some remembrance of us as a tribute Not as fee Grant me two things I pray you Not to deny me and to pardon me PORTIA You press me far and therefore I will yield To Antonio Give me your gloves Ill wear them for your sake To Bassanio And for your love Ill take this ring from you Do not draw back your hand Ill take no more And you in love shall not deny me this BASSANIO This ring good sir Alas it is a trifle I will not shame myself to give you this PORTIA I will have nothing else but only this And now methinks I have a mind to it BASSANIO Theres more depends on this than on the value The dearest ring in Venice will I give you And find it out by proclamation Only for this I pray you pardon me PORTIA I see sir you are liberal in offers You taught me first to beg and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answerd BASSANIO Good sir this ring was given me by my wife And when she put it on she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it PORTIA That scuse serves many men to save their gifts And if your wife be not a madwoman And know how well I have deservd this ring She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me Well peace be with you Exeunt Portia and Nerissa ANTONIO My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued gainst your wifes commandment BASSANIO Go Gratiano run and overtake him Give him the ring and

Lorenzo and Jessica LORENZO The moon shines bright In such a night as this When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighd his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night JESSICA In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully oertrip the dew And saw the lions shadow ere himself And ran dismayd away LORENZO In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild seabanks and waft her love To come again to Carthage JESSICA In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old son LORENZO In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont JESSICA In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved

Lorenzo Sola sola LORENZO Leave holloaing man Here LAUNCELET Sola Where where LORENZO Here LAUNCELET Tell him theres a post come from my master with his horn full of good news My master will be here ere morning Exit LORENZO Sweet soul lets in and there expect their coming And yet no matter why should we go in My friend Stephano signify I pray you Within the house your mistress is at hand And

touches of sweet harmony Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold Theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst But in his motion like an angel sings Still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins Such harmony is in immortal souls But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it Enter Musicians Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear And draw her home with music Music JESSICA I am never merry when I hear sweet music LORENZO The reason is your spirits are attentive For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud Which is the hot condition of their blood If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound Or any air of music touch their ears You shall perceive them make a mutual stand Their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods Since naught so stockish hard and full of rage But music for the time doth change his nature The man that hath no music in himself Nor is not movd with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus Let no such man be trusted Mark the music Enter Portia and Nerissa PORTIA That light we see is burning in my hall How far that little candle throws his beams So shines a good deed in a naughty world NERISSA When the moon shone we did not see the candle PORTIA So doth the greater glory

ULYSSES What hath she done Prince that can soil our mothers TROILUS Nothing at all unless that this were she THERSITES Will he swagger himself out ons own eyes TROILUS This she No this is Diomeds Cressida If beauty have a soul this is not she If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies If sanctimony be the gods delight If there be rule in unity itself This was not she O madness of discourse That cause sets up with and against itself Bifold authority where reason can revolt Without perdition and loss assume all reason Without revolt this is and is not Cressid Within my soul there doth conduce a fight Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate Divides more wider than the sky and earth And yet the spacious breadth of this divisionAdmits no orifice for a point as subtle As

thanks Exeunt Troilus Aeneas and Ulysses THERSITES Would I could meet that rogue Diomed I would croak like a raven I would bode I would bode Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of

than a man HECTOR What vice is that Good Troilus chide me for it TROILUS When many times the captive Grecian falls Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword You bid them rise and live HECTOR O tis fair play TROILUS Fools play by heaven Hector HECTOR How now how now TROILUS For th love of all the gods Lets leave the hermit Pity with our mother And when we have our armours buckled on The venomd

as they are made forgot as soon As done Perseverance dear my lord Keeps honour bright To have done is to hang Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail In monumental mockry Take the instant way For honour travels in a strait so narrow Where one but goes abreast Keep then the path For emulation hath a thousand sons That one by one pursue if you give way Or hedge aside from the direct forthright Like to an entred tide they all rush by And leave you hindmost Or like a gallant horse falln in first rank Lie there for pavement to the abject rear Oerrun and trampled on Then what they do in present Though less than yours in past must oertop yours For Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by thhand And with his arms outstretchd as he would fly Grasps in the comer The welcome ever smiles And farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was For beauty wit High birth vigour of bone desert in service Love friendship charity are subjects all To envious and calumniating Time One touch of nature makes the whole world kin That all with one consent praise newborn gauds Though they are made and moulded of things past And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt oerdusted The present eye praises the present object Then marvel not thou great and complete man That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what stirs not The cry went once on thee And still it might and yet it may again If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive And case thy reputation in thy tent Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late Made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves And drave great Mars to faction ACHILLES Of this my privacy I have strong reasons ULYSSES But gainst your privacy The reasons are more potent and heroical Tis known Achilles that you are in love With one of Priams daughters ACHILLES Ha known ULYSSES Is that a wonder The providence thats in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus gold Finds bottom in thuncomprehensive deeps Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles There is a mysterywith whom relation Durst never meddlein the soul of state Which hath an operation more divine Than breath or pen can give expressure to All the commerce that you have had with Troy As perfectly is ours as yours my lord And better would it fit Achilles much To throw down Hector than Polyxena But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home When fame shall in our island sound her trump And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing Great Hectors sister did Achilles win But our great Ajax bravely beat down him Farewell my lord I as your lover speak The fool slides oer the ice that you should break Exit PATROCLUS To this effect Achilles have I movd you A woman impudent and mannish grown Is not more loathd than an effeminate man In time of action I stand condemnd for this They think my little stomach

air ACHILLES Shall Ajax fight with Hector PATROCLUS Ay and perhaps receive much honour by him ACHILLES I see my reputation is at stake My fame is shrewdly gord PATROCLUS O then beware Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves Omission to do what is necessary Seals a commission to a blank of danger And danger like an ague subtly taints Even then when they sit idly in the sun ACHILLES Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus Ill send the fool to Ajax and desire him Tinvite the Trojan lords after the combat To see us here unarmd I have a womans longing An appetite that I am sick withal To see great Hector in his weeds of peace To talk with him and to behold his visage Even to my full of view Enter Thersites A labour savd THERSITES A wonder ACHILLES What THERSITES Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself ACHILLES How so THERSITES He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing ACHILLES How can that be THERSITES Why a stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say There were wit in this head and twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking The mans undone for ever for if Hector break not his neck i th combat hell breakt himself in vainglory He knows not me I said Good morrow Ajax and he replies Thanks Agamemnon What think you of this man that takes me for the general Hes grown a very land fish languageless a monster A plague of opinion A man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkinACHILLES Thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites THERSITES Who I Why hell answer nobody he professes not answering Speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue ins arms I will put on his presence Let Patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of Ajax ACHILLES To him Patroclus Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmd to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonourd Captain General of the Grecian army Agamemnon Do this PATROCLUS Jove bless great Ajax THERSITES Hum PATROCLUS I come from the worthy Achilles THERSITES Ha

ere he has me PATROCLUS Your answer sir THERSITES Fare ye well with all my heart ACHILLES Why but he is not in this tune is he THERSITES No but out of tune thus What music will be in him when Hector

another to his horse for thats the more capable creature ACHILLES My mind is troubled like a fountain stirrd And I myself see not the bottom of it Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus THERSITES Would the

We shall be much unwelcome AENEAS That I assure you Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece Than Cressid borne from Troy PARIS There is no help The bitter disposition of the time Will have it so On lord well follow you AENEAS Good morrow all Exit with servant PARIS And tell me noble Diomed faith tell me true Even in the soul of sound goodfellowship Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best Myself or Menelaus DIOMEDES Both alike He merits well to have her that doth seek her Not making any scruple of her soilure With such a hell of pain and world of charge And you as well to keep her that defend her Not palating the taste of her dishonour With such a costly loss of wealth and friends He like a puling cuckold would drink up The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece You like a lecher out of whorish loins Are pleasd to breed out your inheritors Both merits poisd each weighs nor less nor more But he as he the heavier for a whore PARIS You are too bitter to your countrywoman DIOMEDES Shes bitter to her country Hear me Paris For every false drop in her bawdy veins A Grecians life hath sunk for every scruple Of her contaminated carrion weight A Trojan hath been slain Since she could speak She hath not given so many good words breath As for her Greeks and Trojans suffred death PARIS Fair Diomed you do as chapmen do Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy But we in silence hold

prevents Our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows Even in the birth of our own labouring breath We two that with so many thousand sighs Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves With the rude brevity and discharge of one Injurious time now with a robbers haste Crams his rich thievry up he knows not how As many farewells as be stars in heaven With distinct breath and consignd kisses to them

O heavens Be true again TROILUS Hear why I speak it love The Grecian youths are full of quality Theyre loving well composd with gifts of nature Flowing and swelling oer with arts and exercise How novelty may move and parts with person Alas a kind of godly jealousy Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin Makes me afeard CRESSIDA O heavens you love me not TROILUS Die I a villain then In this I do not call your faith in question So mainly as my merit I cannot sing Nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk Nor play at subtle games fair virtues all To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant But I can tell that in each grace of these There lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil That tempts most cunningly But be not tempted CRESSIDA Do you think I will TROILUS No But something may be done that we will not And sometimes we are devils to ourselves When we will tempt the frailty of our powers Presuming on their changeful potency AENEAS Within Nay good my lord TROILUS Come kiss

conditions AGAMEMNON Tis done like Hector ACHILLES But securely done A little proudly and great deal misprising The knight opposd AENEAS If not Achilles sir What is your name ACHILLES If not Achilles nothingAENEAS Therefore Achilles But whateer know this In the extremity of great and little Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector The one almost as infinite as all The other blank as nothing Weigh him well And that which looks like pride is courtesy This Ajax is half made of Hectors blood In love whereof half Hector stays at home Half heart half hand half Hector comes to seek This blended knight half Trojan and half Greek ACHILLES A maiden battle then O I perceive you Reenter Diomedes AGAMEMNON Here is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight Stand by our Ajax As you and Lord Aeneas Consent upon the order of their fight So be it either to the uttermost Or else a breath The combatants being kin Half stints their strife before their strokes begin Ajax and Hector enter the lists ULYSSES They are opposd already AGAMEMNON What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy ULYSSES The youngest son of Priam a true knight Not yet mature yet matchless firm of word Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue Not soon provokd nor being provokd soon calmd His heart and hand both open and both free For what he has he gives what thinks he shows Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath Manly as Hector but more dangerous For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love They call him Troilus and on him erect A second hope as fairly built as Hector Thus says Aeneas one that knows the youth Even to his inches and with private soul Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me Alarum Hector and Ajax fight AGAMEMNON They are in action NESTOR Now Ajax hold thine own TROILUS Hector thou sleepst awake thee AGAMEMNON His blows are well disposd There Ajax Trumpets cease

this is Trojan the sinews of this leg All Greek and this all Troy my mothers blood Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister Bounds in my fathers by Jove multipotent Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member Wherein my sword had not impressure made Of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay That any drop thou borrowdst from thy mother My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword Be drained Let me embrace thee Ajax By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms Hector would have them fall upon him thus Cousin all honour to thee AJAX I thank thee Hector Thou art too gentle and too free a man I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence A great addition earned in thy death HECTOR Not Neoptolemus so mirable On whose bright crest Fame with her loudst Oyes Cries This is he could promise to himself A thought of added honour torn from Hector AENEAS There is expectance here from both the sides What further you will do HECTOR Well answer it The issue is embracement Ajax farewell AJAX If I might in entreaties find success As seld I have the chance I would desire My famous cousin to our Grecian tents DIOMEDES Tis Agamemnons wish and great Achilles Doth long to see unarmd the valiant Hector HECTOR Aeneas call my brother Troilus to me And signify this loving interview To the expecters of our Trojan part Desire them home Give me thy hand my cousin I will go eat with thee and see your knights Agamemnon and the rest of the Greeks come forward AJAX Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here HECTOR The worthiest of them tell me name by name But for Achilles my own searching eyes Shall find him by his large and portly size AGAMEMNON Worthy all arms as welcome as to one That would be rid of such an enemy But thats no welcome Understand more clear Whats past and whats to come is strewd with husks

well but bade me not commend her to you MENELAUS Name her not now sir shes a deadly theme HECTOR O pardon I offend NESTOR I have thou gallant Trojan seen thee oft Labouring for destiny make cruel way Through ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee As hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed Despising many forfeits and subduements When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i thair Not letting it decline on the declined That I have said to some my standersby Lo Jupiter is yonder dealing life And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath When that a ring of Greeks have shrapd thee in Like an Olympian wrestling This have I seen But this thy countenance still lockd in steel I never saw till now I knew thy grandsire And once fought with him He was a soldier good But by great Mars the captain of us all Never like thee O let an old man embrace thee And worthy warrior welcome to our tents AENEAS Tis the old Nestor HECTOR Let me embrace thee good old chronicle That hast so long walkd hand in

seasond with a gracious voice Obscures the show of evil In religion What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who inward searchd have livers white as milk And these assume but valours excrement To render them redoubted Look on beauty And you shall see tis purchasd by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature Making them lightest that wear most of it So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness often known To be the dowry of a second

signd ratified by you PORTIA You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand Such as I am though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself A thousand times more fair ten thousand times More rich That only to stand high in your account I might in virtues beauties livings friends Exceed account But the full sum of me Is sum of something which to term in gross Is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractisd Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted But now I was the lord

constant man What worse and worse With leave Bassanio I am half yourself And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you BASSANIO O sweet Portia Here are a few of the unpleasantst words That ever blotted paper Gentle lady When I did first impart my love to you I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins I was a gentleman And then I told you true And yet

true Salerio Hath all his ventures faild What not one hit From Tripolis from Mexico and England From Lisbon Barbary and India And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch Of merchantmarring rocks SALERIO Not one my lord Besides it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew He would not take it Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man He plies the Duke at morning and at night And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice Twenty merchants The Duke himself and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture of justice and his bond JESSICA When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonios flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him And I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor Antonio PORTIA Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble BASSANIO The dearest friend to me the kindest man The best conditiond and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies and one in whom The ancient Roman

commodity that strangers have With us in Venice if it be denied Twill much impeach the justice of the state Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations Therefore go These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor Well gaoler on pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt and then I care not Exeunt SCENE IV Belmont A room in Portias house Enter Portia Nerissa Lorenzo Jessica and Balthazar LORENZO Madam although I speak it in your presence You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord But if you knew to whom you show this honour How true a gentleman you send relief How dear a lover of my lord your husband I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you PORTIA I never did repent for doing good Nor shall not now for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments of manners and of spirit Which makes me think that this Antonio Being the bosom lover of my lord Must needs be like my lord If it be so How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty This comes too near the praising of myself Therefore no more of it Hear other things Lorenzo I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lords return For mine own part I have toward heaven breathd a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation Only attended by Nerissa here Until her husband and my lords return There is a monastery two miles off And there we will abide I do desire you Not to deny this imposition The which

place of Lord Bassanio and myself So fare you well till we shall meet again LORENZO Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you JESSICA I wish your ladyship all hearts content PORTIA I thank you for

And use thou all th endeavour of a man In speed to Padua see thou render this Into my cousins hands Doctor Bellario And look what notes and garments he doth give thee Bring them I pray thee with imagind speed Unto the traject to the common ferry Which trades to Venice Waste no time in words But get thee gone I shall be there before thee BALTHAZAR Madam I go with all convenient speed Exit PORTIA Come on Nerissa I have work in hand That you yet know not of well see our husbands Before they think of us NERISSA Shall they see us PORTIA They shall Nerissa but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack Ill hold thee any wager When we are both accoutered like young men Ill prove the prettier fellow of the two And wear my dagger with the braver grace And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies How honourable ladies sought my love Which I denying they fell sick and died I could not do withal Then Ill repent And wish for all that that I had not killd them And twenty of these puny lies Ill tell That men shall swear I have discontinued school About a twelvemonth I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks Which I will practise NERISSA Why shall we turn to men PORTIA Fie what a questions

kind of bastard hope neither JESSICA And what hope is that I pray thee LAUNCELET Marry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the Jews daughter JESSICA That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me LAUNCELET Truly then I fear you are damnd both by father and mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother Well you are gone both ways JESSICA I shall be saved by my husband He hath made me a Christian LAUNCELET Truly the more to blame he we were Christians enow before een as many as could well live one by another This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be porkeaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money Enter Lorenzo JESSICA Ill tell my husband Launcelet what you say Here he comes LORENZO I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelet if you thus get my wife into corners JESSICA Nay you need not fear us Lorenzo Launcelet and I are out He tells me flatly theres no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jews daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork LORENZO I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negros belly The Moor is with child by you Launcelet LAUNCELET It is much that the Moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her for LORENZO How every fool can play upon the word I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots Go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner LAUNCELET That is done sir they have all stomachs LORENZO Goodly Lord what a witsnapper are you Then bid them prepare dinner LAUNCELET That is done too sir only cover is the word LORENZO Will you cover then sir LAUNCELET Not so sir neither I know my duty LORENZO Yet more quarrelling with occasion Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner LAUNCELET For the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern Exit LORENZO O dear discretion how his words are suited The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words and I do know A many fools that stand in better place Garnishd like him that for a tricksy word Defy the matter How cheerst thou Jessica And now good sweet say thy opinion How dost thou like the Lord Bassanios wife JESSICA Past all expressing It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life For having such a blessing in his lady He finds the joys of heaven here on earth And if on earth he do not merit it In reason he should never come to heaven Why if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women And Portia one there must be something else Pawnd with the other for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow LORENZO Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife JESSICA Nay but ask my opinion too of that LORENZO I will anon First let us go to dinner JESSICA Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach LORENZO No pray thee let it serve for tabletalk Then howsomeer thou speakst mong other things I shall digest it JESSICA Well Ill set you forth Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I Venice A court of justice Enter the Duke the Magnificoes Antonio Bassanio Gratiano Salerio and others DUKE What is Antonio here ANTONIO Ready so please your Grace DUKE I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer A stony adversary an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity void and empty From any dram of mercy ANTONIO I have heard Your Grace hath taen great pains to qualify His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envys reach I do oppose My patience to his fury and am armd To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his DUKE Go one and call the Jew into the court SALARINO He is ready at the door He comes my lord Enter Shylock DUKE Make room and let him stand before our face Shylock the world thinks and I think so too That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act and then tis thought Thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty And where thou now exacts the penalty Which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But touchd with human gentleness and love Forgive a moiety of the principal Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back Enow to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint From stubborn Turks and Tartars never traind To offices of tender courtesy We all expect a gentle answer Jew SHYLOCK I have possessd your Grace of what I purpose And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond If you deny it let the danger light Upon your charter and your citys freedom Youll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats Ill not answer that But say it is my humour Is it answerd What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleasd to give ten thousand ducats To have it band What are you answerd yet Some men there are love not a gaping pig Some that are mad if they behold a cat And others when the bagpipe sings i the nose Cannot contain their urine for affection Mistress of passion sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer As there is no firm reason to be renderd Why he cannot abide a gaping pigWhy he a harmless necessary cat Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend himself being offended So can I give no reason nor I will not More than a lodgd hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio that I follow thus A losing suit against him Are you answered BASSANIO This is no answer thou unfeeling man To excuse the current of thy cruelty SHYLOCK I am not bound to please thee with my answer BASSANIO Do all men kill the things they do not love SHYLOCK Hates any man the thing he would not kill BASSANIO Every offence is not a hate at first SHYLOCK What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ANTONIO I pray you think you question with the Jew You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven You may as well do anything most hard As seek to soften thatthan which whats harder His Jewish heart Therefore I do beseech you Make no moe offers use no farther means But with all brief and plain conveniency Let me have judgment and the Jew his will BASSANIO For thy three thousand ducats here is six SHYLOCK If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts and every part a ducat I would not draw them I would have my bond DUKE How shalt thou hope for mercy rendring none SHYLOCK What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong You have among you many a purchasd slave Which like your asses and your dogs and mules You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them Shall I say to you Let them be free marry them to your heirs Why sweat they under burdens Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasond with such viands You will answer The slaves are ours So do I answer you The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought tis mine and I will have it If you deny me fie upon your law There is no force in the decrees of Venice I stand for judgment Answer shall I have it DUKE Upon my power I may dismiss this court Unless Bellario a learned doctor Whom I have sent for to determine this Come here today SALARINO My lord here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor New come from Padua DUKE Bring us the letters Call the messenger BASSANIO Good cheer Antonio What man courage yet The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood ANTONIO I am a tainted wether of the flock Meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground and so let me You cannot better be employd Bassanio Than to live still and write mine epitaph Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyers clerk DUKE Came you from Padua from Bellario NERISSA From both my lord Bellario greets your Grace Presents a letter BASSANIO Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly SHYLOCK To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there GRATIANO Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew Thou makst thy knife keen But no metal can No not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee SHYLOCK No none that thou hast wit enough to make GRATIANO O be thou damnd inexecrable dog And for thy life let justice be accusd Thou almost makst me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men Thy currish spirit Governd a wolf who hangd for human slaughter Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infusd itself in thee for thy desires Are wolfish bloody starvd and ravenous SHYLOCK Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond Thou but offendst thy lungs to speak so loud Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall To cureless ruin I stand here for law DUKE This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court Where is he NERISSA He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether youll admit him DUKE OF VENICE With all my heart some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place Meantime the court shall hear Bellarios letter Reads Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome His name is Balthazar I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant We turnd oer many books together He is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Graces request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation You hear the learnd Bellario what he writes And here I take it is the doctor come Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws Give me your hand Come you from old Bellario PORTIA I did my lord DUKE You are welcome Take your place Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court PORTIA I am informed throughly of the cause Which is the merchant here And which the Jew DUKE Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth PORTIA Is your name Shylock SHYLOCK Shylock is my name PORTIA Of a strange nature is the suit you follow Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed To Antonio You stand within his danger do you not ANTONIO Ay so he says PORTIA Do you confess the bond ANTONIO I do PORTIA Then must the Jew be merciful SHYLOCK On what compulsion must I Tell me that PORTIA The quality of mercy is not straind It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath It is twice blest It blesseth him that gives and him that takes Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown His sceptre shows the force of temporal power The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings But mercy is above this sceptred sway It is enthroned in the hearts of kings It is an attribute to God himself And earthly power doth then show likest Gods When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew Though justice be thy plea consider this That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation We do pray for mercy And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there SHYLOCK My deeds upon my head I crave the law The penalty and forfeit of my bond PORTIA Is he not able to discharge the money BASSANIO Yes here I tender it for him in the court Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times oer On forfeit of my hands my head my heart If this will not suffice it must appear That malice bears down truth And I beseech you Wrest once the law to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And curb this cruel devil of his will PORTIA It must not be there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established Twill be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state It cannot be SHYLOCK A Daniel come to judgment Yea a Daniel O wise young judge how I do honour thee PORTIA I pray you let me look upon the bond SHYLOCK Here tis most reverend doctor here it is PORTIA Shylock theres thrice thy money offered thee SHYLOCK An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven Shall I lay perjury upon my

gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry sole possessor of my love Is of a king become a banished man And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of Englands trueanointed lawful king This is the cause that I poor Margaret With this my son Prince Edward Henrys heir Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid And if thou fail us all our hope is done Scotland hath will to help but cannot help Our people and our peers are both misled Our treasure seized our soldiers put to flight And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight KING LEWIS Renowned queen with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it off QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay the stronger grows our foe KING LEWIS The more I stay the more Ill succour thee QUEEN MARGARET O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow Enter Warwick KING LEWIS Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence QUEEN MARGARET Our Earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friend KING LEWIS Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France He descends Queen Margaret rises QUEEN MARGARET Ay now begins a second storm to rise For this is he that moves both wind and tide WARWICK From worthy Edward king of Albion My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend I come in kindness and unfeigned love First to do greetings to thy royal person And then to crave a league of amity And lastly to confirm that amity With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister To Englands king in lawful marriage QUEEN MARGARET Aside If that go forward Henrys hope is done WARWICK To Bona And gracious madam in our kings behalf I am commanded with your leave and favour Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue To tell the passion of my sovereigns heart Where fame late entering at his heedful ears Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak Before you answer Warwick His demand Springs not from Edwards wellmeant honest love But from deceit bred by necessity For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice That Henry liveth still but were he dead Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henrys son Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour For though usurpers sway the rule awhile Yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs WARWICK Injurious Margaret PRINCE EDWARD And why not Queen WARWICK Because thy father Henry did usurp And thou no more art prince than she is queen OXFORD Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth Who by his prowess conquered all France From these our Henry lineally descends WARWICK Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten Methinks these peers of France should smile at that But for the rest you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years a silly time To make prescription for a kingdoms worth OXFORD Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years And not bewray thy treason with a blush WARWICK Can Oxford that did ever fence the right Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree For shame Leave Henry and call Edward king OXFORD Call him my king by whose injurious doom My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere Was done to death And more than so my father Even in the downfall of his mellowed years When nature brought him to the door of death No Warwick no while life upholds this arm This arm upholds the house of Lancaster WARWICK And I the house of York KING LEWIS Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside While I use further conference with Warwick They stand aloof QUEEN MARGARET Heavens grant that Warwicks words bewitch him not KING LEWIS Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience Is Edward your true king For I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosen WARWICK Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour KING LEWIS But is he gracious in the peoples eye WARWICK The more that Henry was unfortunate KING LEWIS Then further all dissembling set aside Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona WARWICK Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself Myself have often heard him say and swear That this his love was an eternal plant Whereof the root was fixed in virtues ground The leaves and fruit maintained with beautys sun Exempt from envy but not from disdain Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain KING LEWIS Now sister let us hear your firm resolve BONA Your grant or your denial shall be mine To Warwick Yet I confess that often ere this day When I have heard your kings desert recounted Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire KING LEWIS Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwards And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king PRINCE EDWARD To Edward but not to the English king QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend KING LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret But if your title to the crown be weak As may appear by Edwards good success Then tis but reason that I be released From giving aid which late I promised Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield WARWICK Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease Where having nothing nothing can he lose And as for you yourself our quondam queen You have a father able to maintain you And better twere you troubled him than France QUEEN MARGARET Peace impudent and shameless Warwick Proud setter up and puller down of kings I will not hence till with my talk and tears Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love For both of you are birds of selfsame feather Post blowing a horn within KING LEWIS Warwick this is some post to us or thee Enter the Post POST My lord ambassador these letters are for you Sent from your brother Marquess Montague These from our king unto your Majesty And madam these for you from whom I know not They all read their letters OXFORD I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his PRINCE EDWARD Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled I hope alls for the best KING LEWIS Warwick what are thy news And yours fair Queen QUEEN MARGARET Mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys WARWICK Mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent KING LEWIS What has your king married the Lady Grey And now to soothe your forgery and his Sends me a paper to persuade me patience Is this th alliance that he seeks with France Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner QUEEN MARGARET I told your majesty as much before This proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honesty WARWICK King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss That I am clear from this misdeed of Edwards No more my king for he dishonours me But most himself if he could see his shame Did I forget that by the house of York My father came untimely to his death Did I let pass th abuse done to my niece Did I impale him with the regal crown Did I put Henry from his native right And am I guerdoned at the last with shame Shame on himself for my desert is honour And to repair my honour lost for him I here renounce him and return to Henry My noble Queen let former grudges pass And henceforth I am thy true servitor I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona And replant Henry in his former state QUEEN MARGARET Warwick these words have turned my hate to love And I forgive and quite forget old faults And joy that thou becomst King Henrys friend WARWICK So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers Ill undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war Tis not his newmade bride shall succour him And as for Clarence as my letters tell me Hes very likely now to fall from him For matching more for wanton lust than honour Or than for strength and safety of our country BONA Dear brother how shall Bona be revenged But by thy help to this distressed queen QUEEN MARGARET Renowned prince how shall poor Henry live Unless thou rescue him from foul despair BONA My quarrel and this English queens are one WARWICK And mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours KING LEWIS And mine with hers and thine and Margarets Therefore at last I firmly am resolved You shall have aid QUEEN MARGARET Let me give humble thanks for all at once KING LEWIS Then Englands messenger return in post And tell false Edward thy supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over maskers To revel it with him and his new bride Thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal BONA Tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly Ill wear the willow garland for his sake QUEEN MARGARET Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside And I am ready to put armour on WARWICK Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore Ill uncrown him ere t be long Theres thy reward be gone Exit Post KING LEWIS But Warwick Thou and Oxford with five thousand men Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle And as occasion serves this noble Queen And prince shall follow with a fresh supply Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty WARWICK This shall assure my constant loyalty That if our Queen and this young prince agree Ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands QUEEN MARGARET Yes I agree and thank you for your motion Son Edward she is fair and virtuousTherefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable That only Warwicks daughter shall be thine PRINCE EDWARD Yes I accept her for she well deserves it And here to pledge my vow I give my hand He gives his hand to Warwick KING LEWIS Why stay we now These soldiers shall be levied And thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral Shall waft them over with our royal fleet I long till Edward fall by wars mischance For mocking marriage with a dame of France Exeunt all but Warwick WARWICK I came from Edward as ambassador But I return his sworn and mortal foe Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me But dreadful war shall answer his demand Had he none else to make a stale but me Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow I was the chief that raised him to the crown And Ill be chief to bring him down again Not that I pity Henrys misery But seek revenge on Edwards mockery Exit ACT IV SCENE I London The Palace Enter Richard Duke

Ay and twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well together KING EDWARD Setting your scorns and your mislike aside Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and Englands queen And you too Somerset and Montague Speak freely what you think GEORGE Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis Becomes your enemy for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady Bona RICHARD And Warwick doing what you gave in charge Is now dishonoured by this new marriage KING EDWARD What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased By such invention as I can devise MONTAGUE Yet to have joined with France in such alliance Would more have strengthened this our commonwealth Gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage HASTINGS Why knows not Montague that of itself England is safe if true within itself MONTAGUE But the safer when tis backed with France HASTINGS Tis better using France than trusting France Let us be backed with God and with the seas Which He hath givn for fence impregnable And with their helps only defend ourselves In them and in ourselves our safety lies GEORGE For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford KING EDWARD Ay what of that It was my will and grant And for this once my will shall stand for law RICHARD And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride She better would have fitted me or Clarence But in your bride you bury brotherhood GEORGE Or else you would not have bestowed the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wifes son And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere KING EDWARD Alas poor Clarence is it for a wife That thou art malcontent I will provide thee GEORGE In choosing for yourself you showed your judgment Which being shallow you shall give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf And to that end I shortly mind to leave you KING EDWARD Leave me or tarry Edward will be king And not be tied unto his brothers will QUEEN ELIZABETH My lords before it pleased his Majesty To raise my state to title of a queen Do me but right and you must all confess That I was not ignoble of descent And meaner than myself have had like fortune But as this title honours me and mine So your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow KING EDWARD My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns What danger or what sorrow can befall thee So long as Edward is thy constant friend And their true sovereign whom they must obey Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too

may surprise and take him at our pleasure Our scouts have found the adventure very easy That as Ulysses and stout Diomede With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus tents And brought from thence the

urgd withal Your high displeasure All this uttered With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast Who all as hot turns deadly point to point And with a martial scorn with one hand beats Cold death aside and with the other sends It back to Tybalt whose dexterity Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud Hold friends Friends part and swifter than his tongue His agile arm beats down their fatal points And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled But by and by comes back to Romeo Who had but newly entertaind revenge And tot they go like lightning for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly This is the truth or let Benvolio die LADY CAPULET He is a kinsman to the Montague Affection makes him false he speaks not true Some twenty of

memory Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished That banished that one word banished Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts death Was woe enough if it had ended there Or if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be rankd with other griefs Why followd not when she said Tybalts dead Thy father or thy mother nay or both Which modern lamentation might

You have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due CONSTABLE It is the best horse of Europe ORLEANS Will it never be morning DAUPHIN My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable you talk of horse and armour ORLEANS You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world DAUPHIN What a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns Chha He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus qui a les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes ORLEANS Hes of the colour of the nutmeg DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus He is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him He is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts CONSTABLE Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage ORLEANS No more cousin DAUPHIN Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereigns sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus Wonder of nature ORLEANS I have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistress DAUPHIN Then did they imitate that which I composd to my courser for my horse is my mistress ORLEANS Your mistress bears well DAUPHIN Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress CONSTABLE Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back DAUPHIN So perhaps did yours CONSTABLE Mine was not bridled DAUPHIN O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait strossers CONSTABLE You have good judgment in horsemanship DAUPHIN Be warnd by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my mistress CONSTABLE I had as lief have my mistress a jade DAUPHIN I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hairCONSTABLE I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress DAUPHIN Le chien est retourn son propre vomissement et la truie lave au bourbier Thou makst use of anything CONSTABLE Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose RAMBURES My Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent tonight are those stars or suns upon it CONSTABLE Stars my lord DAUPHIN Some of them will fall tomorrow I hope CONSTABLE And yet my sky shall not want DAUPHIN That may be for you bear a many superfluously and twere more honour some were away CONSTABLE Even as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted DAUPHIN Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English faces CONSTABLE I will not say so for fear I should be facd out of my way But I would it were morning for I would fain be about the ears of the English RAMBURES Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners CONSTABLE You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them DAUPHIN Tis midnight Ill go arm myself Exit ORLEANS The Dauphin longs for morning RAMBURES He longs to eat the English CONSTABLE I think he will eat all he kills ORLEANS By the white hand of my lady hes a gallant prince CONSTABLE Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath ORLEANS He is simply the most active gentleman of France CONSTABLE Doing is activity and he will still be doing ORLEANS He never did harm that I heard of CONSTABLE Nor will do none tomorrow He will keep that good name still ORLEANS I know him to be valiant CONSTABLE I was told that by one that knows him better than you ORLEANS Whats he CONSTABLE Marry he told me so himself and he said he card not who knew it ORLEANS He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him CONSTABLE By my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but his lackey Tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate ORLEANS Ill will never said well CONSTABLE I will cap that proverb with There is flattery in friendship ORLEANS And I will take up that with Give the devil his due CONSTABLE Well placd There stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with A pox of the devil ORLEANS You are the better at proverbs by how much A fools bolt is soon shot CONSTABLE You have shot over ORLEANS Tis not the first time you were overshot Enter a Messenger MESSENGER My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents CONSTABLE Who hath measurd the ground MESSENGER The Lord Grandpr CONSTABLE A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we do ORLEANS What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England to mope with his fatbraind followers so far out of his knowledge CONSTABLE If the English had any apprehension they would run away ORLEANS That they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces RAMBURES That island of England breeds very valiant creatures Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage ORLEANS Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushd like rotten apples You may as well say thats a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion CONSTABLE Just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils ORLEANS Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef CONSTABLE Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we about it ORLEANS It is now two oclock but let me see by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen Exeunt ACT IV Enter Chorus CHORUS Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe From camp to camp through the foul womb of night The hum of either army stilly sounds That the fixd sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each others watch Fire answers fire and through their paly flames Each battle sees the others umberd face Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs Piercing the nights dull ear and from the tents The armourers accomplishing the knights With busy hammers closing rivets up Give dreadful note of preparation The country cocks do crow the clocks do toll And the third hour of drowsy morning name Proud of their numbers and secure in soul The confident and overlusty French Do the lowrated English play at dice And chide the cripple tardygaited Night Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp So tediously away The poor condemned English Like sacrifices by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The mornings danger and their gesture sad Investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats Presented them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold The royal captain of this ruind band Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent Let him cry Praise and glory on his head For forth he goes and visits all his host Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers friends and countrymen Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour Unto the weary and allwatched night But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty That every wretch pining and pale before Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks A largess universal like the sun His liberal eye doth give to everyone Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all Behold as may unworthiness define A little touch of Harry in the night And so our scene must to the battle fly WhereO for pitywe shall much disgrace With four or five most vile and ragged foils Right illdisposd in brawl ridiculous The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see Minding true things by what their mockries be Exit SCENE I The English camp at Agincourt Enter King Henry Bedford and Gloucester KING HENRY Gloucester tis true that we are in great danger The greater therefore should our courage be Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty There is some soul of goodness in things evil Would men observingly distil it out For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers Which is both healthful and good husbandry Besides they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself Enter Erpingham Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France ERPINGHAM Not so my liege this lodging likes me better Since I may say Now lie I like a king KING HENRY Tis good for men to love their present pains Upon example so the spirit is eased And when the mind is quickned out of doubt The organs though defunct and dead before Break up their drowsy grave and newly move With casted slough and fresh legerity Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both Commend me to the princes in our camp Do my good morrow to them and anon Desire them all to my pavilion GLOUCESTER We shall my liege ERPINGHAM Shall I attend your Grace KING HENRY No my good knight Go with my brothers to my lords of England I and my bosom must debate a while And then I would no other company ERPINGHAM The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry Exeunt all but King KING HENRY Godamercy old heart thou speakst cheerfully Enter Pistol PISTOL Qui vous l KING HENRY A friend PISTOL Discuss unto me art thou officer Or art thou base common and popular KING HENRY I am a gentleman of a company PISTOL Trailst thou the puissant pike KING HENRY Even so What are you PISTOL As good a gentleman as the Emperor KING HENRY Then you are a better than the King PISTOL The Kings a bawcock and a heart of gold A lad of life an imp of fame Of parents good of fist most valiant I kiss his dirty shoe and from heartstring I love the lovely bully What is thy name KING HENRY Harry le Roy PISTOL Le Roy a Cornish name Art thou of Cornish crew KING HENRY No I am a Welshman PISTOL Knowst thou Fluellen KING HENRY Yes PISTOL Tell him Ill knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davys day KING HENRY Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours PISTOL Art thou his friend KING HENRY And his kinsman too PISTOL The fico for thee then KING HENRY I thank you God be with you PISTOL My name is Pistol calld Exit KING HENRY It sorts well with your fierceness Enter Fluellen and Gower GOWER Captain Fluellen FLUELLEN So in the name of Jesu Christ speak lower It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and anchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddle taddle nor pibble pabble in Pompeys camp I warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise GOWER Why the enemy is loud you hear him all night FLUELLEN If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb In your own conscience now GOWER I will speak lower FLUELLEN I pray you and beseech you that you will Exeunt Gower and Fluellen KING HENRY Though it appear a little out of fashion There is much care and valour in this Welshman Enter three soldiers John Bates Alexander Court and Michael Williams COURT Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder BATES I think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day WILLIAMS We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we shall never see the end of it Who goes there KING HENRY A friend WILLIAMS Under what captain serve you KING HENRY Under Sir Thomas Erpingham WILLIAMS A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray you what thinks he of our estate KING HENRY Even as men wreckd upon a sand that look to be washd off the next tide BATES He hath not told his thought to the King KING HENRY No nor it is not meet he should For though I speak it to you I think the King is but a man as I am The violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions His ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his armyBATES He may show what outward courage he will but I believe as cold a night as tis he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here KING HENRY By my troth I will speak my conscience of the King I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is BATES Then I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor mens lives saved KING HENRY I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens minds Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the Kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable WILLIAMS Thats more than we know BATES Ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the Kings subjects If his cause be wrong our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us WILLIAMS But if the cause be not good the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads choppd off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all We died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection KING HENRY So if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his masters command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcild iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servants damnation But this is not so The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services Besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of Peace with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from God War is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punishd for beforebreach of the Kings laws in now the Kings quarrel Where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited Every subjects duty is the Kings but every subjects soul is his own Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare WILLIAMS Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the King is not to answer for it BATES I do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine to fight lustily for him KING HENRY I myself heard the King say he would not be ransomd WILLIAMS Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransomd and we neer the wiser KING HENRY If I live to see it I will never trust his word after WILLIAMS You pay him then Thats a perilous shot out of an eldergun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacocks feather Youll never trust his word after Come tis a foolish saying KING HENRY Your reproof is something too round I should be angry with you if the time were convenient WILLIAMS Let it be a quarrel between us if you live KING HENRY I embrace it WILLIAMS How shall I know thee again KING HENRY Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darst acknowledge it I will make it my quarrel WILLIAMS Heres my glove give me another of thine KING HENRY There WILLIAMS This will I also wear in my cap If ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow This is my glove by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear KING HENRY If ever I live to see it I will challenge it WILLIAMS Thou darst as well be hangd KING HENRY Well I will do it though I take thee in the Kings company WILLIAMS Keep thy word fare thee well BATES Be friends you English fools be friends We have French quarrels enough if you could tell how to reckon KING HENRY Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no English treason to cut French crowns and tomorrow the King himself will be a clipper Exeunt soldiers Upon the King Let us our lives our souls Our debts our careful wives Our children and our sins lay on the King We must bear all O hard condition Twinborn with greatness subject to the breath Of every fool whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing What infinite hearts ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy And what have kings that privates have not too Save ceremony save general ceremony And what art thou thou idol Ceremony What kind of god art thou that sufferst more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers What are thy rents What are thy comings in O Ceremony show me but thy worth What is thy soul of adoration Art thou aught else but place degree and form Creating awe and fear in other men Wherein thou art less happy being feard Than they in fearing What drinkst thou oft instead of homage sweet But poisond flattery O be sick great greatness And bid thy Ceremony give thee cure Thinkst thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation Will it give place to flexure and low bending Canst thou when thou commandst the beggars knee Command the health of it No thou proud dream That playst so subtly with a kings repose I am a king that find thee and I know Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball The sword the mace the crown imperial The intertissued robe of gold and pearl The farced title running fore the King The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp That beats upon the high shore of this world No not all these thricegorgeous Ceremony Not all these laid in bed majestical Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave Who with a body filld and vacant mind Gets him to rest crammd with distressful bread Never sees horrid night the child of hell But like a lackey from the rise to set Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse And follows so the everrunning year With profitable labour to his grave And but for ceremony such a wretch Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep Had the forehand and vantage of a king The slave a member of the countrys peace Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots What watch the King keeps to maintain the peace Whose hours the peasant best advantages Enter Erpingham ERPINGHAM My lord your nobles jealous of your absence Seek through your camp to find you KING HENRY Good old knight Collect them all together at my tent Ill be before thee ERPINGHAM I shall dot my lord Exit KING HENRY O God of battles steel my soldiers hearts Possess them not with fear Take from them now The sense of reckoning if the opposed numbers Pluck their hearts from them Not today O Lord O not today think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown I Richards body have interred new And on it have bestowd more contrite tears Than from it issued forced drops of blood Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay Who twice a day their witherd hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richards soul More will I do Though all that I can do is nothing worth Since that my penitence comes after all Imploring pardon Enter Gloucester GLOUCESTER My liege KING HENRY My brother Gloucesters voice Ay I know thy errand I will go with thee The day my friends and all things stay for me Exeunt SCENE II The French camp Enter the Dauphin Orleans Rambures and others ORLEANS The sun doth gild our armour up my lords DAUPHIN Monte cheval My horse varlet laquais ha ORLEANS O brave spirit DAUPHIN Via les eaux et terre ORLEANS Rien puis Lair et feu DAUPHIN Cieux cousin Orleans Enter Constable Now my Lord Constable CONSTABLE Hark how our steeds for present service neigh DAUPHIN Mount them and make incision in their hides That their hot blood may spin in English eyes And dout them with superfluous courage ha RAMBURES What will you have them weep our horses blood How shall we then behold their natural tears Enter a Messenger MESSENGER The English are embattld you French peers CONSTABLE To horse you gallant princes straight to horse Do but behold yon poor and starved band And your fair show shall suck away their souls Leaving them but the shales and husks of men There is not work enough for all our hands Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins To give each naked curtleaxe a stain That our French gallants shall today draw out And sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them The vapour of our valour will oerturn them Tis positive gainst all exceptions lords That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants Who in unnecessary action swarm About our squares of battle were enough To purge this field of such a hilding foe Though we upon this mountains basis by Took stand for idle speculation But that our honours must not Whats to say A very little little let us do And all is done Then let the trumpets soundThe tucket sonance and the note to mount For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall crouch down in fear and yield Enter Grandpr GRANDPR Why do you stay so long my lords of France Yond island carrions desperate of their bones Illfavouredly become the morning field Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose And our air shakes them passing scornfully Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggard host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks With torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades Lob down their heads drooping the hides and hips The gum downroping from their paledead eyes And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit Lies foul with chewd grass still and motionless And their executors the knavish crows Fly oer them all impatient for their hour Description cannot suit itself in words To demonstrate the life of such a battle In life so lifeless as it shows itself CONSTABLE They have said their prayers and they stay for death DAUPHIN Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits And give their fasting horses provender And after fight with them CONSTABLE I stay but for my guard on to the

crack or lightnings flash Advanced above pale envys threatning reach As when the golden sun salutes the morn And having gilt the ocean with his beams Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach And overlooks the highestpeering hills So Tamora Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held fettred in amorous chains And faster bound to Aarons charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold To wait upon this newmade empress To wait said I To wanton with this queen This goddess this Semiramis this nymph This siren that will charm Romes Saturnine And see his shipwrack and his commonweals Holla What storm is this Enter Chiron and Demetrius braving DEMETRIUS Chiron thy years wants wit thy wit wants edge And manners to intrude where I am graced And may for aught thou knowest affected be CHIRON Demetrius thou dost overween in all And so in this to bear me down with braves Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate I am as able and as fit as thou To serve and to deserve my mistress grace And that my sword upon thee shall approve And plead my passions for Lavinias love AARON Aside Clubs clubs These lovers will not keep the peace DEMETRIUS Why boy although our mother unadvised Gave you a dancingrapier by your side Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends Go to have your lath glued within your sheathTill you know better how to handle it CHIRON Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare DEMETRIUS Ay boy grow ye so brave They draw AARON Why how now lords So near the emperors palace dare ye draw And maintain such a quarrel openly Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome For shame put up DEMETRIUS Not I till I have sheathed My rapier in his bosom and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breathed in my dishonour here CHIRON For that I am prepared and full resolved Foulspoken coward that thundrest with thy tongue And with thy weapon nothing darst perform AARON Away I say Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore This pretty brabble will undo us all Why lords and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a princes right What is Lavinia then become so loose Or Bassianus so degenerate That for her love such quarrels may be broached Without controlment justice or revenge Young lords beware And should the empress know This discords ground the music would not please CHIRON I care not I knew she and all the world I love Lavinia more than all the world DEMETRIUS Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice Lavina is thine elder brothers hope AARON Why are ye mad Or know ye not in Rome How furious and impatient they be And cannot brook competitors in love I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths By this device CHIRON Aaron a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I love AARON To achieve her How DEMETRIUS Why makes thou it so strange She is a woman therefore may be wooed She is a woman therefore may be won She is Lavinia therefore must be loved What man more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know Though Bassianus be the emperors brother Better than he have worn Vulcans badge AARON Aside Ay and as good as Saturninus may DEMETRIUS Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words fair looks and liberality What hast not thou full often struck a doe And borne her cleanly by the keepers nose AARON Why then it seems some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns CHIRON Ay so the turn were served DEMETRIUS Aaron thou hast hit it AARON Would you had hit it too Then should not we be tired with this ado Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools To square for this Would it offend you then That both should speed CHIRON Faith not me DEMETRIUS Nor me so I were one AARON For shame be friends and join for that you jar Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect and so must you resolve That what you cannot as you would achieve You must perforce accomplish as you may Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia Bassianus love A speedier course than lingring languishment Must we pursue and I have found the path My lords a solemn hunting is in hand There will the lovely Roman ladies troop The forest walks are wide and spacious And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villainy Single you thither then this dainty doe And strike her home by force if not by words This way or not at all stand you in hope Come come our empress with her sacred wit To villainy and vengeance consecrate Will we acquaint with all what we intend And she shall file our engines with advice That will not suffer you to square yourselves But to your wishes height advance you both The emperors court is like the house of Fame The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull There speak and strike brave boys and take your turns There serve your lust shadowed from heavens eye And revel in Lavinias treasury CHIRON Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice DEMETRIUS Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits Per Stygia per manes vehor Exeunt SCENE II A Forest near Rome a Lodge seen at a distance Horns and cry of hounds heard Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sons and Marcus making a noise with hounds and horns TITUS The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey The fields are fragrant and the woods are green Uncouple here and let us make a bay And wake the emperor and his lovely bride And rouse the prince and ring a hunters peal That all the court may echo with the noise Sons let it be your charge as it is ours To attend the emperors person carefully I have been troubled in my sleep this night But dawning day new comfort hath inspired Here a cry of hounds and wind horns in a peal Then enter Saturninus Tamora Bassianus Lavinia Chiron Demetrius and their Attendants Many good morrows to your majesty Madam to you as many and as good I promised your grace a hunters peal SATURNINUS And you have rung it lustily my lords Somewhat too early for newmarried ladies BASSIANUS Lavinia how say you LAVINIA I say no I have been broad awake two hours and more SATURNINUS Come on then horse and chariots let us have And to our sport To Tamora Madam now shall ye see Our Roman hunting MARCUS I have dogs my lord Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase And climb the highest promontory top TITUS And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way and run like swallows oer the plain DEMETRIUS Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground Exeunt SCENE III A lonely part of the Forest Enter Aaron alone carrying a bag of gold AARON He that had wit would think that I had none To bury so much gold under a tree And never after to inherit it Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem Which cunningly effected will beget A very excellent piece of villainy And so repose sweet gold for their unrest That have their alms out of the empress chest He hides the bag Enter Tamora alone to the Moor TAMORA My lovely Aaron wherefore lookst thou sad When everything doth make a gleeful boast The birds chant melody on every bush The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind And make a chequered shadow on the ground Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds Replying shrilly to the welltuned horns As if a double hunt were heard at once Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise And after conflict such as was supposed The wandring prince and Dido once enjoyed When with a happy storm they were surprised And curtained with a counselkeeping cave We may each wreathed in the others arms Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurses song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep AARON Madam though Venus govern your desires Saturn is dominator over mine What signifies my deadlystanding eye My silence and my cloudy melancholy My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution No madam these are no venereal signs Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand Blood and revenge are hammering in my head Hark Tamora the empress of my soul Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee This is the day of doom for Bassianus His Philomel must lose her tongue today Thy sons make pillage of her chastity And wash their hands in Bassianus blood Seest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee And give the king this fatalplotted scroll Now question me no more we are espied Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty Which dreads not yet their lives destruction Enter Bassianus and Lavinia TAMORA Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life AARON No more great empress Bassianus comes Be cross with him and Ill go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels whatsoeer they be Exit BASSIANUS Who have we here Romes royal empress Unfurnished of her wellbeseeming troop Or is it Dian habited like her Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest TAMORA Saucy controller of my private steps Had I the power that some say Dian had Thy temples should be planted presently With horns as was Actaeons and the hounds Should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs Unmannerly intruder as thou art LAVINIA Under your patience gentle empress Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try experiments Jove shield your husband from his hounds today Tis pity they should take him for a stag BASSIANUS Believe me queen your swarthy Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his bodys hue Spotted detested and abominable Why are you sequestered from all your train Dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed And wandered hither to an obscure plot Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor If foul desire had not conducted you LAVINIA And being intercepted in your sport Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness I pray you let us hence And let her joy her ravencoloured love This valley fits the purpose passing well BASSIANUS The king my brother shall have notice of this LAVINIA Ay for these slips have made him noted long Good king to be so mightily abused TAMORA Why I have patience to endure all this Enter Chiron and Demetrius DEMETRIUS How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother Why doth your highness look so pale and wan TAMORA Have I not reason think you to look pale These two have ticed me hither to this place A barren detested vale you see it is The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven And when they showed me this abhorred pit They told me here at dead time of the night A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins Would make such fearful and confused cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly No sooner had they told this hellish tale But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew And leave me to this miserable death And then they called me foul adulteress Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect And had you not by wondrous fortune come This vengeance on me had they executedRevenge it as you love your mothers life Or be ye not henceforth called my children DEMETRIUS This is a witness that I am thy son Stabs Bassianus

dam O do not learn her wrath she taught it thee The milk thou suckst from her did turn to marble Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny Yet every mother breeds not sons alike To Chiron Do thou entreat her show a womans pity CHIRON What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard LAVINIA Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark Yet have I heardO could I find it now The lion moved with pity did endure To have his princely paws pared all away Some say that ravens foster forlorn children The whilst their own birds famish in their nests O be to me though thy hard heart say no Nothing so kind but something pitiful TAMORA I know not what it means away with her LAVINIA O let me teach thee For my fathers sake That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee Be not obdurate open thy deaf ears TAMORA Hadst thou in person neer offended me Even for his sake am I pitiless Remember boys I poured forth tears in vain To save your brother from the sacrifice But fierce Andronicus would not relent Therefore away with her and use her as you will The worse to her the better loved of me LAVINIA O Tamora be called a gentle queen And with thine own hands kill me in this place For tis not life that I have begged so long Poor I was slain when Bassianus died TAMORA What beggst thou then Fond woman let me go LAVINIA Tis present death I beg and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell O keep me from their worse than killing lust And tumble me into some loathsome pit Where never mans eye may behold my body Do this and be a charitable murderer TAMORA So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee No let them satisfy their lust on thee DEMETRIUS Away for thou hast stayed us here too long LAVINIA No grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature The blot and enemy to our general

subtle hole is this Whose mouth is covered with rudegrowing briers Upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers A very fatal place it seems to me Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall MARTIUS O brother with the dismallst object hurt That ever eye with sight made heart lament AARON Aside Now will I fetch the king to find them here That he thereby may have a likely guess How these were they that made away his brother Exit MARTIUS Why dost not comfort me and help me out From this unhallowed and bloodstained hole QUINTUS I am surprised with an uncouth fear A chilling sweat oerruns my trembling joints My heart suspects more than mine eye can see MARTIUS To prove thou hast a truedivining heart Aaron and thou look down into this den And see a fearful sight of blood and death QUINTUS Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise O tell me who it is for neer till now Was I a child to fear I know not what MARTIUS Lord Bassianus lies berayed in blood All on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb In this detested dark blooddrinking pit QUINTUS If it be dark how dost thou know tis he MARTIUS Upon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring that lightens all the hole Which like a taper in some monument Doth shine upon the dead mans earthy cheeks And shows the ragged entrails of the pit So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood O brother help me with thy fainting hand If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath Out of this fell devouring receptacle As hateful as Cocytus misty mouth QUINTUS Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out Or wanting strength to do thee so much good I may be plucked into the swallowing womb Of this deep pit poor Bassianus grave I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink MARTIUS Nor I no strength to climb without thy help QUINTUS Thy hand once more I will not loose again Till thou art here aloft or I below Thou canst not come to me I come to thee Falls in Enter the Emperor Saturninus and Aaron the Moor SATURNINUS Along with me Ill see what hole is here And what he is that now is leapt into it Say who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth MARTIUS The unhappy sons of old Andronicus Brought hither in a most unlucky hour To find thy brother Bassianus dead SATURNINUS My brother dead I know thou dost but jest He and his lady both are at the lodge Upon the north side of this pleasant chase Tis not an hour since I left them there MARTIUS We know not where you left them all alive But out alas here have we found him dead Enter Tamora Titus Andronicus and Lucius TAMORA Where is my lord the king SATURNINUS Here Tamora though grieved with killing grief TAMORA Where is thy brother Bassianus SATURNINUS Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound Poor Bassianus here lies murdered TAMORA Then all too late I bring this fatal writ The complot of this timeless tragedy And wonder greatly that mans face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny She giveth Saturnine a letter SATURNINUS Reads An if we miss to meet him handsomely Sweet huntsman Bassianus tis we mean Do thou so much as dig the grave for him Thou knowst our meaning Look for thy reward Among the nettles at the eldertree Which overshades the mouth of that same pit Where we decreed to bury Bassianus Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends O Tamora was ever heard the like This is the pit and this the eldertree Look sirs if you can find the huntsman out That should have murdered Bassianus here AARON My gracious lord here is the bag of gold Showing it SATURNINUS To Titus Two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind Have here bereft my brother of his life Sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison There let them bide until we have devised Some neverheardof torturing pain for them TAMORA What are they in this pit O wondrous thing How easily murder is discovered TITUS High emperor upon my feeble knee I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed That this fell fault of my accursed sons Accursed if the fault be proved in them SATURNINUS If it be proved You see it is apparent Who found this letter Tamora was it you TAMORA Andronicus himself did take it up TITUS I did my lord yet let me be their bail For by my fathers reverend tomb I vow They shall be ready at your highness will To answer their suspicion with their lives SATURNINUS Thou shalt not bail them See thou follow me Some bring the murdered body some the murderers Let them not speak a word the guilt is plain For by my soul were there worse end than death That end upon them should be executed TAMORA Andronicus I will entreat the king Fear not thy sons they shall do well enough TITUS Come Lucius come stay not to talk with them Exeunt severally Attendants bearing the body SCENE IV Another part of the Forest Enter the empress sons Demetrius and Chiron

thy meaning so An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe DEMETRIUS See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl CHIRON Go home call for sweet water wash thy hands DEMETRIUS She hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash And so lets leave her to her silent walks CHIRON An twere my cause I should go hang myself DEMETRIUS If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord Exeunt Chiron and Demetrius Enter Marcus from hunting MARCUS Who is this My niece that flies away so fast Cousin a word where is your husband If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me If I do wake some planet strike me down That I may slumber an eternal sleep Speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands Hath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare Of her two branches those sweet ornaments Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in And might not gain so great a happiness As half thy love Why dost not speak to me Alas a crimson river of warm blood Like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips Coming and going with thy honey breath But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue Ah now thou turnst away thy face

brothers blood Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence And whats in prayer but this twofold force To be forestalled ere we come to fall Or pardond being down Then Ill look up My fault is past But O what form of prayer Can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder That cannot be since I am still possessd

down you shall not budge You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you QUEEN What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murder me Help help ho POLONIUS Behind What ho help help help HAMLET How now A rat Draws Dead for a ducat dead Makes a pass through the arras POLONIUS Behind O I am slain Falls and dies QUEEN O me what hast thou done HAMLET Nay I know not Is it the King Draws forth Polonius QUEEN O what a rash and bloody deed is this HAMLET A bloody deed Almost as bad good mother As kill a king and marry with his brother QUEEN As kill a king HAMLET Ay lady twas my word To Polonius Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell I took thee for thy better Take thy fortune Thou findst to be too busy is some danger Leave wringing of your hands Peace sit you down And let me wring your heart for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuff If damned custom have not brazd it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense QUEEN What have I done that thou darst wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me HAMLET Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there Makes marriage vows As false as dicers oaths O such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words Heavens face doth glow Yea this solidity and compound mass With tristful visage as against the doom Is thoughtsick at the act QUEEN Ay me what act That roars so loud and thunders in the index HAMLET Look here upon this picture and on this The counterfeit presentment of two brothers See what a grace was seated on this brow Hyperions curls the front of Jove himself An eye like Mars to threaten and command A station like the herald Mercury New lighted on a heavenkissing hill A combination and a form indeed Where every god did seem to set his seal To give the world assurance of a man This was your husband Look you now what follows Here is your husband like a mildewd ear Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed And batten on this moor Ha have you eyes You cannot call it love for at your age The heyday in the blood is tame its humble And waits upon the judgement and what judgement Would step from this to this Sense sure you have Else could you not have motion but sure that sense Is apoplexd for madness would not err Nor sense to ecstacy was neer so thralld But it reservd some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference What devil wast That thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind Eyes without feeling feeling without sight Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell If thou canst mutine in a matrons bones To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her own fire Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will QUEEN O Hamlet speak no more Thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct HAMLET Nay but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed Stewd in corruption honeying and making love Over the nasty sty QUEEN O speak to me no more These words like daggers enter in mine ears No more sweet Hamlet HAMLET A murderer and a villain A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord A vice of kings A cutpurse of the empire and the rule That from a shelf the precious diadem stole And put it in his pocket QUEEN No more HAMLET A king of shreds and patches Enter Ghost Save me and hover oer me with your wings You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure QUEEN Alas hes mad HAMLET Do you not come your tardy son to chide That lapsd in time and passion lets go by The important acting of your dread command O say GHOST Do not forget This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose But look amazement on thy mother sits O step between her and her fighting soul Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works Speak to her Hamlet HAMLET How is it with you lady QUEEN Alas how ist with you That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep And as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm Your bedded hairs like life in excrements Start up and stand an end O gentle son Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look HAMLET On him on him Look you how pale he glares His form and cause conjoind preaching to stones Would make them capableDo not look upon me Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects Then what I have to do Will want true colour tears perchance for blood QUEEN To whom do you speak this HAMLET Do you see nothing thereQUEEN Nothing at all yet all that is I see HAMLET Nor did you nothing hear QUEEN No nothing but ourselves HAMLET Why look you there look how it steals away My father in his habit as he livd Look where he goes even now out at the portal Exit Ghost QUEEN This is the very coinage of your brain This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in HAMLET Ecstasy My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music It is not madness That I have utterd Bring me to the test And I the matter will reword which madness Would gambol from Mother for love of grace Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks It will but skin and film the ulcerous place Whilst rank corruption mining all within Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven Repent whats past avoid what is to come And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good QUEEN O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain HAMLET O throw away the worser part of it And live the purer with the other half Good night But go not to mine uncles bed Assume a virtue if you have it not That monster custom who all sense doth eat Of habits evil is angel yet in this That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on Refrain tonight And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence The next more easy For use almost can change the stamp of nature And either curb the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency Once more good night And when you are desirous to be blesd Ill blessing beg of you For this same lord Pointing to Polonius I do repent but heaven hath pleasd it so To punish me with this and this with me That I must be their scourge and minister I will bestow him and will answer well The death I gave him So again good night I must be cruel only to be kind Thus bad begins and worse remains behind One word more good lady QUEEN What shall I do HAMLET Not this by no means that I bid you do Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse And let him for a pair of reechy kisses Or paddling in your neck with his damnd fingers Make you to ravel all this matter out That I essentially am not in madness But mad in craft Twere good you let him know For who thats but a queen fair sober wise Would from a paddock from a bat a gib Such dear concernings hide Who would do so No in despite of sense and secrecy Unpeg the basket on the houses top Let the birds fly and like the famous ape To try conclusions in the basket creep And break your own neck down QUEEN Be thou assurd if words be made of breath And breath of life I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me HAMLET I must to England you know that QUEEN Alack I had forgot Tis so concluded on HAMLET Theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows Whom I will trust as I will adders fangd They bear the mandate they must sweep my way And marshal me to knavery Let it work For tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon O tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet This man shall set me packing Ill lug the guts into the neighbour room Mother good night Indeed this counsellor Is now most still most secret and most grave Who was in life a foolish prating knave Come sir to draw toward an end with you Good night mother Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius ACT IV SCENE I A room in the Castle Enter King Queen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern KING

apart the body he hath killd Oer whom his very madness like some ore Among a mineral of metals base Shows itself pure He weeps for what is done KING O Gertrude come away The sun no sooner shall the

me for a sponge my lord HAMLET Ay sir that soaks up the Kings countenance his rewards his authorities But such officers do the King best service in the end he keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again ROSENCRANTZ I understand you not my lord HAMLET I am glad of it A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear ROSENCRANTZ My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King HAMLET The body is with the King but the King is not with the body The King

behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein LUCULLUS La la la la Nothing doubting says he Alas good lord A noble gentleman tis if he would not keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha dined with him and told him ont and come again to

scald thee Let molten coin be thy damnation Thou disease of a friend and not himself Has friendship such a faint and milky heart It turns in less than two nights O you gods I feel my masters passion This slave Unto his honour has my lords meat in him Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment When he is turned to poison O may diseases only work upont And when hes sick to death let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for be of any power To expel sickness but prolong his hour Exit SCENE II A public place Enter Lucius with three Strangers LUCIUS Who the Lord Timon He is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman FIRST STRANGER We know him for no less though we are but strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him LUCIUS Fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money SECOND STRANGER But believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely fort and showed what necessity belonged tot and yet was denied LUCIUS How SECOND STRANGER I tell you denied my lord LUCIUS What a strange case was that Now before the gods I am ashamed ont Denied that honourable man There was very little honour showed int For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should neer have denied his occasion so many talents Enter Servilius SERVILIUS See by good hap yonders my lord I have sweat to see his honour To Lucius My honoured lord LUCIUS Servilius You are kindly met sir Fare thee well Commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend SERVILIUS May it please your honour my lord hath sent LUCIUS Ha What has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord hes ever sending How shall I thank him thinkest thou And what has he sent now SERVILIUS Has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents LUCIUS I know his lordship is but merry with me He cannot want fiftyfive hundred talents SERVILIUS But in the meantime he wants less my lord If his occasion were not virtuous I should not urge it half so faithfully LUCIUS Dost thou speak seriously Servilius SERVILIUS Upon my soul tis true sir LUCIUS What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha shown myself honourable How unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to dothe more beast I sayI was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him SERVILIUS Yes sir I shall LUCIUS Ill look you out a good turn Servilius Exit Servilius True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed And he thats once denied will hardly speed Exit FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this Hostilius SECOND STRANGER Ay too well FIRST STRANGER Why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece Is every flatterers spirit Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish For in my knowing Timon has been this lords father And kept his credit with his purse Supported his estate nay Timons money Has paid his men their wages He neer drinks But Timons silver treads upon his lip And yetO see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape He does deny him in respect of his What charitable men afford to beggars THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it FIRST STRANGER For mine own part I never tasted Timon in my life Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend Yet I protest For his right noble mind illustrious virtue And honourable carriage Had his necessity made use of me I would have put my wealth into donation And the best half should have returned to him So much I love his heart But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense For policy sits above conscience Exeunt SCENE III The same A room in Sempronius house Enter a Third Servant of Timons with Sempronius another of Timons friends SEMPRONIUS Must he needs trouble me int Hum Bove all others He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus And now Ventidius is wealthy too Whom he redeemed from prison All these Owe their estates unto him SERVANT My lord They have all been touched and found base metal For they have all denied him SEMPRONIUS How Have they denied him Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me Three Humh It shows but little love or judgment in him Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians Thrive give him over Must I take th cure upon me Has much disgraced me int Im angry at him That might have known my place I see no sense fort But his occasions might have wooed me first For in my conscience I was the first man That eer received gift from him And does he think so backwardly of me now That Ill requite it last No So it may prove an argument of laughter To th rest and I mongst lords be thought a fool Id rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first but for my minds sake Id such a courage to do him good But now return And with their faint reply this answer join Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin Exit SERVANT Excellent Your lordships a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself byt and I cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his politic love This was my lords best hope now all are fled Save only the gods Now his friends are dead Doors that were neer acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employed Now to guard sure their master And this is all a liberal course allows Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house Exit SCENE IV A hall in Timons house Enter two of Varros Servants meeting Titus and Hortensius and then Lucius all Servants of Timons creditors to wait for his coming out

So much PHILOTUS Is not my lord seen yet LUCIUS Not yet PHILOTUS I wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven LUCIUS Ay but the days are waxed shorter with him You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the suns but not like his recoverable I fear tis deepest winter in Lord Timons purse That is one may reach deep enough and yet Find little PHILOTUS I am of your fear for that TITUS Ill show you how t observe a strange event Your lord sends now for money HORTENSIUS Most true he does TITUS And he wears jewels now of Timons gift For which I wait for money HORTENSIUS It is against my heart LUCIUS Mark how strange it shows Timon in this should pay more than he owes And een as if your lord should wear rich jewels And send for money for em HORTENSIUS Im weary of this charge the gods can witness I know my lord hath spent of Timons wealth And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth FIRST VARROS SERVANT Yes mines three thousand crowns Whats yoursLUCIUS Five thousand mine FIRST VARROS SERVANT Tis much deep and it should seem by th sum Your masters confidence was above mine Else surely his had equalled Enter Flaminius TITUS One of Lord Timons men LUCIUS Flaminius Sir a word Pray is my lord ready to come forth FLAMINIUS No indeed he is not TITUS We attend his lordship pray signify so much FLAMINIUS I need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent Exit Flaminius Enter Flavius in a cloak muffled LUCIUS Ha is not that his steward muffled so He goes away in a cloud Call him call him TITUS Do you hear sir SECOND VARROS SERVANT By your leave sir FLAVIUS What do you ask of me my friend TITUS We wait for certain money here sir FLAVIUS Ay If money were as certain as your waiting Twere sure enough Why then preferred you not your sums and bills When your false masters eat of my lords meat Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down th interest into their gluttonous maws You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up Let me pass quietly Believet my lord and I have made an end I have no more to reckon he to spend LUCIUS Ay but this answer will not serve FLAVIUS If twill not serve tis not so base as you For you serve knaves Exit FIRST VARROS SERVANT How What does his cashiered worship mutter SECOND VARROS SERVANT No matter what hes poor and thats revenge enough Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in Such may rail against great buildings Enter Servilius TITUS O heres Servilius now we shall know some answer SERVILIUS If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much fromt For taket of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has forsook him hes much out of health and keeps his chamber LUCIUS Many do keep their chambers are not sick And if it be so far beyond his health Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts And make a clear way to the gods SERVILIUS Good gods TITUS We cannot take this for answer sir FLAMINIUS Within Servilius help My lord my lord Enter Timon in a rage TIMON What are my doors opposed against my passage Have I been ever free and must my house Be my retentive enemy my jail The place which I have feasted does it now Like all mankind show me an iron heart LUCIUS Put in now Titus TITUS My lord here is my bill LUCIUS Heres mine H"

thou knowst Thy countrys strength and weaknessthine own ways Whether to knock against the gates of Rome Or rudely visit them in parts remote To fright them ere destroy But come in Let me commend thee first to those that shall Say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes And more a friend than eer an enemy Yet Martius that was much Your hand Most welcome Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius Two of the Servingmen come forward FIRST SERVINGMAN Heres a strange alteration SECOND SERVINGMAN By my hand I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him FIRST SERVINGMAN What an arm he has He turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top SECOND SERVINGMAN Nay I knew by his face that there was something in him He had sir a kind of face methoughtI cannot tell how to term it FIRST SERVINGMAN He had so looking as it wereWould I were hanged but I thought there was more in him than I could think SECOND SERVINGMAN So did I Ill be sworn He is simply the rarest man i th world FIRST SERVINGMAN I think he is But a greater soldier than he you wot one SECOND SERVINGMAN Who my master FIRST SERVINGMAN Nay its no matter for that SECOND SERVINGMAN Worth six on him FIRST SERVINGMAN Nay not so neither But I take him to be the greater soldier SECOND SERVINGMAN Faith look you one cannot tell how to say that For the

SERVINGMAN What what what Lets partake THIRD SERVINGMAN I would not be a Roman of all nations I had as lief be a condemned man FIRST and SECOND SERVINGMAN Wherefore Wherefore THIRD SERVINGMAN Why heres he that was wont to thwack our general Caius Martius FIRST SERVINGMAN Why do you say thwack our general THIRD SERVINGMAN I do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him SECOND SERVINGMAN Come we are fellows and friends He was ever too hard for him I have heard him say so himself FIRST SERVINGMAN He was too hard for him directly to say the troth ont before Corioles he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado SECOND SERVINGMAN An he had been cannibally given he might have boiled and eaten him too FIRST SERVINGMAN But more of thy news THIRD SERVINGMAN Why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars set at upper end o th table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him Our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself withs hand and turns up the white o th eye to his discourse But the bottom of the news is our general is cut i th middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table Hell go he says and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th ears He will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled SECOND SERVINGMAN And hes as like to dot as any man I can imagine THIRD SERVINGMAN Dot He will dot For look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilest hes in directitude FIRST SERVINGMAN Directitude Whats that THIRD SERVINGMAN But when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like coneys after rain and revel all with him FIRST SERVINGMAN But when goes this forward THIRD SERVINGMAN Tomorrow today presently You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon Tis as it were parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips SECOND SERVINGMAN Why then we shall have a stirring world again This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed balladmakers FIRST SERVINGMAN Let me have war say I It exceeds peace as far as day does night Its sprightly walking audible and full of vent Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than wars a destroyer of men SECOND SERVINGMAN Tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds FIRST SERVINGMAN Ay and it makes men hate one another THIRD SERVINGMAN Reason because they then less need one another The wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians

Oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking Selfloving SICINIUS And affecting one sole throne without assistance MENENIUS I think not so SICINIUS We should by this to all our lamentation If he had gone forth consul found it so BRUTUS The gods have well prevented it and Rome Sits safe and still without him Enter an Aedile AEDILE Worthy tribunes There is a slave whom we have put in prison Reports

constant fools Who ist can blame him Your enemies and his find something in him MENENIUS We are all undone unless The noble man have mercy COMINIUS Who shall ask it The Tribunes cannot dot for shame the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds For his best friends if they Should say Be good to Rome they charged him even As those should do that had deserved his hate And therein showed like enemies MENENIUS Tis true If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it I have not the face To say Beseech you ceaseYou have made fair hands You and your crafts You have crafted fair COMINIUS You have brought A trembling upon Rome such as was never S incapable of help TRIBUNES Say not we brought it MENENIUS How Was it we We loved him but like beasts And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters Who did hoot him out o th city COMINIUS But I fear Theyll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius The second name of men obeys his points As if he were his officer Desperation Is all the policy strength and defence That Rome can make against them Enter a troop of Citizens MENENIUS Here comes the clusters And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus exile Now hes coming And not a hair upon a soldiers head Which will not prove a whip As many coxcombs As you threw

AUFIDIUS Do they still fly to th Roman LIEUTENANT I do not know what witchcrafts in him but Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat Their talk at table and their thanks at end And you are darkned in this action sir Even by your own AUFIDIUS I cannot help it now Unless by using means I lame the foot Of our design He bears himself more proudlier Even to my person than I thought he would When first I did embrace him Yet his nature In thats no changeling and I must excuse What cannot be amended LIEUTENANT Yet I wish sir I mean for your particularyou had not Joined in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solely AUFIDIUS I understand thee well and be thou sure When he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly And shows good husbandry for the Volscian"

ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus health whom if she sleep Hell so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proudst conspirator that lives TAMORA My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine Lord of my life commander of my thoughts Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus age Th effects of sorrow for his valiant sons Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts Aside Why thus it shall become Highwitted Tamora to gloze

The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of highresolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus did SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were

Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage

Rome Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with drums and soldiers LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us Well follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believst no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath AARON What if I do not As indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sisters tongue and ravished her And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest LUCIUS O detestable villain callst thou that trimming AARON Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons heads Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the empress of this sport She sounded almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses GOTH What canst thou say all this and never blush AARON Ay like a black dog as the saying is LUCIUS Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds AARON Ay that I had not done a thousand more Even now I curse the day and yet I think Few come within the compass of my curse Wherein I did not some notorious ill As kill a man or else devise his death Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it Accuse some innocent and forswear myself Set deadly enmity between two friends Make poor mens cattle break their necks Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night And bid the owners quench them with their tears Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves And set them upright at their dear friends door Even when their sorrows almost was forgot And on their skins as on the bark of trees Have with my knife carved in Roman letters Let not your sorrow die though I am dead But I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand more LUCIUS Bring down the devil for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presently AARON If there be devils would I were a devil To live and burn in everlasting fire So I might have your company in hell But to torment you with my bitter tongue LUCIUS Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more Enter Aemilius GOTH My lord there is a messenger from Rome Desires to be admitted to your presence LUCIUS Let him come near Welcome Aemilius Whats the news from Rome AEMILIUS Lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths The Roman emperor greets you all by me And for he understands you are in arms He craves a parley at your fathers house Willing you to demand your hostages And they shall be immediately delivered FIRST GOTH What says our general LUCIUS Aemilius let the emperor give his pledges Unto my father and my uncle Marcus And we will come March away Exeunt SCENE II Rome Before Tituss House Enter Tamora and her two sons disguised TAMORA Thus in this strange and sad habiliment I will encounter with Andronicus And say I am Revenge sent from below To join with him and right his heinous wrongs Knock at his study where they say he keeps To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge

with Aaron prisoner LUCIUS Uncle Marcus since tis my fathers mind That I repair to Rome I am content FIRST GOTH And ours with thine befall what fortune will LUCIUS Good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor This ravenous tiger this accursed devil Let him receive no sustnance fetter him Till he be brought unto the empress face For testimony of her foul proceedings And see the ambush of our friends be strong I fear the emperor means no good to us AARON Some devil whisper curses in my ear And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth The venomous malice of my swelling heart LUCIUS Away inhuman dog unhallowed slave Sirs help our uncle to convey him in Sound trumpets The trumpets show the emperor is at hand Exeunt Goths with Aaron Enter Emperor Saturninus and Empress Tamora with Aemilius Tribunes and others SATURNINUS What hath the firmament more suns than one LUCIUS What boots it thee to call thyself a sun MARCUS Romes emperor and nephew break the parle These quarrels must be quietly debated The feast is ready which the careful Titus Hath ordained to an honourable end For peace for love for league and good to Rome Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places SATURNINUS Marcus we will Trumpets sounding enter Titus like a cook placing the dishes with Young Lucius and others and Lavinia with a veil over her face TITUS Welcome my lord welcome dread queen Welcome ye warlike Goths welcome Lucius And welcome all Although the cheer be poor Twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it SATURNINUS Why art thou thus attired Andronicus TITUS Because I would be sure to have all well To entertain your highness and your empress TAMORA We are beholden to you good Andronicus TITUS An if your highness knew my heart you were My lord the emperor resolve me this Was it well done of rash Virginius To slay his daughter with his own right hand Because she was enforced stained and deflowered SATURNINUS It was Andronicus TITUS Your reason mighty lord SATURNINUS Because the girl should not survive her shame And by her presence still renew his sorrows TITUS A reason mighty strong and effectual A pattern precedent and lively warrant For me most wretched to perform the like Die die Lavinia and thy shame with thee And with thy shame thy fathers sorrow die He kills Lavinia SATURNINUS What hast thou done unnatural and unkind TITUS Killed her for whom my tears have made me blind I am as woeful as Virginius was And have a thousand times more cause than he To do this outrage and it now is done SATURNINUS What was she ravished Tell who did the deed TITUS Willt please you eat Willt please your highness feed TAMORA Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus TITUS Not I twas Chiron and Demetrius They ravished her and cut away her tongue And they twas they that did her all this wrong SATURNINUS Go fetch them hither to us presently TITUS Why there they are both baked in that pie Whereof their mother daintily hath fed Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred Tis true tis true witness my knifes sharp point He stabs the Empress SATURNINUS Die frantic wretch for this accursed deed He kills Titus LUCIUS Can the sons eye behold his father bleed He kills Saturninus Theres meed for meed death for a deadly deed A great tumult Lucius Marcus and others go aloft to the upper stageMARCUS You sadfaced men people and sons of Rome By uproar severed as a flight of fowl Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts O let me teach you how to knit again This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf These broken limbs again into one body Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to Like a forlorn and desperate castaway Do shameful execution on herself But if my frosty signs and chaps of age Grave witnesses of true experience Cannot induce you to attend my words Speak Romes dear friend to Lucius as erst our ancestor When with his solemn tongue he did discourse To lovesick Didos sad attending ear The story of that baleful burning night When subtle Greeks surprised King Priams Troy Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears Or who hath brought the fatal engine in That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound My heart is not compact of flint nor steel Nor can I utter all our bitter grief But floods of tears will drown my oratory And break my utterance even in the time When it should move you to attend me most And force you to commiseration Heres Romes young captain let him tell the tale While I stand by and weep to hear him speak LUCIUS Then noble auditory be it known to you That Chiron and the damned Demetrius Were they that murdered our emperors brother And they it were that ravished our sister For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded Our fathers tears despised and basely cozened Of that true hand that fought Romes quarrel out And sent her enemies unto the grave Lastly myself unkindly banished The gates shut on me and turned weeping out To beg relief among Romes enemies Who drowned their enmity in my true tears And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend I am the turnedforth be it known to you That have preserved her welfare in my blood And from her bosom took the enemys point Sheathing the steel in my adventrous body Alas you know I am no vaunter I My scars can witness dumb although they are That my report is just and full of truth But soft methinks I do digress too much Citing my worthless praise O pardon me For when no friends are by men praise themselves MARCUS Now is my turn to speak Behold the child Of this was Tamora delivered The issue of an irreligious Moor Chief architect and plotter of these woes The villain is alive in Titus house And as he is to witness this is true Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge These wrongs unspeakable past patience Or more than any living man could bear Now have you heard the truth What say you Romans Have we done aught amiss Show us wherein And from the place where you behold us pleading The poor remainder of Andronici Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls And make a mutual closure of our house Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall AEMILIUS Come come thou reverend man of Rome And bring our emperor gently in thy hand Lucius our emperor for well I know The common voice do cry it shall be so ROMANS Lucius all hail Romes royal emperor MARCUS Go go into old Titus sorrowful house And hither hale that misbelieving Moor To be adjudged some direful slaughtring death As punishment for his most wicked life Exeunt Attendants Lucius and Marcus come down from the upper stage ROMANS Lucius all hail Romes gracious governor LUCIUS Thanks gentle Romans May I govern so To heal Romes harms and wipe away her woe But gentle people give me aim awhile For nature puts me to a heavy task Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk He kisses Titus O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face The last true duties of thy noble son MARCUS Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips O were the sum of these that I should pay Countless and infinite yet would I pay them LUCIUS Come hither boy come come and learn of us To melt in showers Thy grandsire loved thee well Many a time he danced thee on his knee Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow Many a story hath he told to thee And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind And talk of them when he was dead and gone MARCUS How many thousand times hath these poor lips When they were living warmed themselves on thine O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss Bid him farewell commit him to the grave Do them that kindness and take leave of them YOUNG LUCIUS O grandsire grandsire een with all my heart Would I were dead so you did live again O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth Reenter Attendants with Aaron AEMILIUS You sad Andronici have done with woes Give sentence on the execrable wretch That hath been breeder of these dire events LUCIUS Set him breastdeep in earth and famish him There let him stand and rave and cry for food If anyone relieves or pities him For the offence he dies This is our doom Some stay to see him fastened in the earth AARON Ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb I am no baby I that with base prayers I should repent the evils I have done Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did Would I perform if I might have my will If one good deed in all my life I did I do repent it from my very soul LUCIUS Some loving friends convey the emperor hence And give him burial in his fathers grave My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our households monument As for that ravenous tiger Tamora No funeral rite nor man in mournful weed No mournful bell shall ring her burial But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey Her life was beastly and devoid of pity And being dead let birds on her take pity Exeunt TROILUS AND CRESSIDA Contents ACT I Prologue Scene I Troy Before Priams palace Scene II Troy A street Scene III The Grecian

been as sugar Making the hard way sweet and delectable But I bethink me what a weary way From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company Which I protest hath very much beguiled The tediousness and process of my travel But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoyed By

not so resolved when last we spake together PERCY Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh NORTHUMBERLAND Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy PERCY No my good lord for that

deceivable and false BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle YORK Tut tut Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle I am no traitors uncle and that word grace In an ungracious mouth is but profane Why have those banished and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of Englands ground But then more why why have they dared to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom Frighting her palefaced villages with war And ostentation of despised arms Comst thou because the anointed king is hence Why foolish boy the King is left behind And in my loyal bosom lies his power Were I but now lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men From forth the ranks of many thousand French O then how quickly should this arm of mine Now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee And minister correction to thy fault BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle let me know my fault On what condition stands it and wherein YORK Even in condition of the worst degree In gross rebellion and detested treason Thou art a banished man and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereign BOLINGBROKE As I was banished I was banished Hereford But as I come I come for Lancaster And noble uncle I beseech your Grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye You are my father for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O then my father Will you permit that I shall stand condemned A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties Plucked from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born If that my cousin king be King in England It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin Had you first died and he been thus trod down He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay I am denied to sue my livery here And yet my letters patents give me leave My fathers goods are all distrained and sold And these and all are all amiss employed What would you have me do I am a subject And challenge law Attorneys are denied me And therefore personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descent NORTHUMBERLAND The noble Duke hath been too much abused ROSS It stands your Grace upon to do him right WILLOUGHBY Base men by his endowments are made great YORK My lords of England let me tell you this I have had feeling of my cousins wrongs And laboured all I could to do him right But in this kind to come in braving arms Be his own carver and cut out his way To find out right with wrong it may not be And you that do abet him in this kind Cherish rebellion and are rebels all NORTHUMBERLAND The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is But for his own and for the right of that We all have strongly sworn to give him aid And let him never see joy that breaks that oath YORK Well well I see the issue of these arms I cannot mend it I must needs confess Because my power is weak and all illleft But if I could by Him that gave me life I would attach you all and make you stoop Unto the sovereign mercy of the King But since I cannot be it known unto you I do remain as neuter So fare you well Unless you please to enter in the castle And there repose you for this night BOLINGBROKE An offer uncle that we will accept But we must win your Grace to go with us To Bristol Castle which they say is held By Bushy Bagot and their complices The

hardly kept our countrymen together And yet we hear no tidings from the King Therefore we will disperse ourselves Farewell SALISBURY Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman The King reposeth all his confidence in thee CAPTAIN Tis thought the King is dead We will not stay The bay trees in our country are all withered And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven The palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth And leanlooked prophets whisper fearful change Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap The one in fear to lose what they enjoy The other to enjoy by rage and war These signs forerun the death or fall of kings Farewell Our countrymen are gone and fled As well assured Richard their king is dead Exit SALISBURY Ah Richard With the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes And crossly to thy good all fortune goes Exit ACT III SCENE I Bristol Bolingbrokes camp Enter Bolingbroke York Northumberland Harry Percy Willoughby Ross Officers behind with Bushy and Green prisoners BOLINGBROKE Bring forth these men Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls Since presently your souls must part your bodies With too much urging your pernicious livesFor twere no charity yet to wash your blood From off my hands here in the view of men I will unfold some causes of your deaths You have misled a prince a royal king A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments By you unhappied and disfigured clean You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him Broke the possession of a royal bed And stained the beauty of a fair queens cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs Myself a prince by fortune of my birth Near to the King in blood and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me Have stooped my neck under your injuries And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds Eating the bitter bread of banishment Whilst you have fed upon my signories Disparked my parks and felled my forest woods From my own windows torn my household coat Rased out my imprese leaving me no sign Save mens opinions and my living blood To show the world I am a gentleman This and much more much more than twice all this Condemns you to the death See them delivered over To execution and the hand of death BUSHY More welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewell GREEN My comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hell BOLINGBROKE My Lord Northumberland see them dispatched Exeunt Northumberland and Others with Bushy and Green Uncle you say the Queen is at your house For Gods sake fairly let her be

gentle uncle Come lords away To fight with Glendower and his complices A while to work and after holiday Exeunt SCENE II The coast of Wales A castle in view Flourish drums and trumpets Enter King Richard the Bishop of Carlisle Aumerle and soldiers KING RICHARD Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand AUMERLE Yea my lord How brooks your Grace the air After your late tossing on the breaking seas KING RICHARD Needs must I like it well I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand Though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs As a longparted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting So weepingsmiling greet I thee my earth And do thee favours with my royal hands Feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom And heavygaited toads lie in their way Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet Which with usurping steps do trample thee Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch Throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies Mock not my senseless conjuration lords This earth shall have a feeling and these stones Prove armed soldiers ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellions arms CARLISLE Fear not my lord That Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all The means that heaven yields must be embraced And not neglected else if heaven would And we will not Heavens offer we refuse The proffered means of succour and redress AUMERLE He means my lord that we are too remiss Whilst Bolingbroke through our security Grows strong and great in substance and in power KING RICHARD Discomfortable cousin knowst thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid Behind the globe that lights the lower world Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage boldly here But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole Then murders treasons and detested sins The cloak of night being plucked from off their backs Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke Who all this while hath revelled in the night Whilst we were wandring with the Antipodes Shall see us rising in our throne the east His treasons will sit blushing in his face Not able to endure the sight of day But selfaffrighted tremble at his sin Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy elected by the Lord For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel Then if angels fight Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right Enter Salisbury Welcome my lord How far off lies your power SALISBURY Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord Than this weak arm Discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair One day too late I fear me noble lord Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth O call back yesterday bid time return And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men Today today unhappy day too late Oerthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead Are gone to Bolingbroke dispersed and fled AUMERLE Comfort my liege Why looks your Grace so pale KING RICHARD But now the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face and they are fled And till so much blood thither come again Have I not reason to look pale and dead All souls that will be safe fly from my side For time hath set a blot upon my pride AUMERLE Comfort my liege Remember who you are KING RICHARD I had forgot myself Am I not king Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest Is not the Kings name twenty thousand names Arm arm my name A puny subject strikes At thy great glory Look not to the ground Ye favourites of a king Are we not high High be our thoughts I know my uncle York Hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here Enter Sir Stephen Scroop SCROOP More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my caretuned tongue deliver him KING RICHARD Mine ear is open and my heart prepared The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold Say is my kingdom lost Why twas my care And what loss is it to be rid of care Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we Greater he shall not be If he serve God Well serve Him too and be his fellow so Revolt our subjects That we cannot mend They break their faith to God as well as us Cry woe destruction ruin loss decay The worst is death and death will have his day SCROOP Glad am I that your highness is so armed To bear the tidings of calamity Like an unseasonable stormy day Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores As if the world were all dissolved to tears So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty boys with womens voices Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of doublefatal yew against thy state Yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills Against thy seat Both young and old rebel And all goes worse than I have power to tell KING RICHARD Too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot What is become of Bushy Where is Green That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps If we prevail their heads shall pay for it I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke SCROOP Peace have they made with him indeed my lord KING RICHARD O villains vipers damned without redemption Dogs easily won to fawn on any man Snakes in my heartblood warmed that sting my heart Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas Would they make peace Terrible hell Make war upon their spotted souls for this SCROOP Sweet love I see changing his property Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate Again uncurse their souls Their peace is made With heads and not with hands Those whom you curse Have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound And lie full low graved in the hollow ground AUMERLE Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead SCROOP Ay all of them at Bristol lost their heads AUMERLE Where is the Duke my father with his power KING RICHARD No matter where Of comfort no man speak Lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth Lets choose executors and talk of wills And yet not so for what can we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground Our lands our lives and all are Bolingbrokes And nothing can we call our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones For Gods sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings How some have been deposed some slain in war Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed Some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed All murdered For within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp Allowing him a breath a little scene To monarchize be feared and kill with looks Infusing him with self and vain conceit As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass impregnable and humoured thus Comes at the last and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall and farewell king Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence Throw away respect Tradition form and ceremonious duty For you have but mistook me all this while I live with bread like you feel want Taste grief need friends Subjected thus How can you say to me I am a king CARLISLE My lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes But presently prevent the ways to wail To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe And so your follies fight against yourself Fear and be slainno worse can come to fight And fight and die is death destroying death Where fearing dying pays death servile breath AUMERLE My father hath a power Enquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb KING RICHARD Thou chidst me well Proud Bolingbroke I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom This ague fit of fear is overblown An easy task it is to win our ownSay Scroop where lies our uncle with his power Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour SCROOP Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state in inclination of the day So may you by my dull and heavy eye My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke And all your northern castles yielded up And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party KING RICHARD Thou hast said enough To Aumerle Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair What say you now What comfort have we now By heaven Ill hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more Go to Flint Castle There Ill pine away A king woes slave shall kingly woe obey That power I have discharge and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow For I have none Let no man speak again To alter this for counsel is but vain AUMERLE My liege one word KING RICHARD He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue Discharge my followers Let them hence away From Richards night to Bolingbrokes fair day Exeunt SCENE III Wales Before Flint Castle Enter with drum and colours Bolingbroke and Forces Northumberland and Others BOLINGBROKE So that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispersed and Salisbury Is gone to meet the King who lately landed With some few private friends upon this

a sacred king should hide his head NORTHUMBERLAND Your Grace mistakes only to be brief Left I his title out YORK The time hath been Would you have been so brief with him he would Have been so brief with you to shorten you For taking so the head your whole heads length BOLINGBROKE Mistake not uncle further than you should YORK Take not good cousin further than you should Lest you mistake The heavens are oer our heads BOLINGBROKE I know it uncle and oppose not myself Against their will But who comes here Enter Harry Percy Welcome Harry What will not this castle yield PERCY The castle

with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman Of holy reverencewho I cannot learn NORTHUMBERLAND O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle BOLINGBROKE To Northumberland Noble lord Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley Into his ruined ears and thus deliver Henry Bolingbroke On both his knees doth kiss King Richards hand And sends allegiance and true faith of heart To his most royal person hither come Even at his feet to lay my arms and power Provided that my banishment repealed And lands restored again be freely granted If not Ill use the advantage of my power And lay the summers dust with showers of blood Rained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke It is such crimson tempest should bedrench The fresh green lap of fair King Richards land My stooping duty tenderly shall show Go signify as much while here we march Upon the grassy carpet of this plain Lets march without the noise of threatning drum That from this castles tottered battlements Our fair appointments may be well perused Methinks King Richard and myself should meet With no less terror than the elements Of fire and water when their thundring shock At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven Be he the fire Ill be the yielding water The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain My waterson the earth and not on him March on and mark King Richard how he looks A parley sounded and answered by a trumpet within Flourish Enter on the Walls the King the Bishop of Carlisle Aumerle Scroop and Salisbury See see King Richard doth himself appear As doth the blushing discontented sun From out the fiery portal of the east When he perceives the envious clouds are bent To dim his glory and to stain the track Of his bright passage to the occident YORK Yet he looks like a king Behold his eye As bright as is the eagles lightens forth Controlling majesty Alack alack for woe That any harm should stain so fair a show KING RICHARD To Northumberland We are amazed and thus long have we stood To watch the fearful bending of thy knee Because we thought ourself thy lawful king And if we be how dare thy joints forget To pay their awful duty to our presence If we be not show us the hand of God That hath dismissed us from our stewardship For well we know no hand of blood and bone Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre Unless he do profane steal or usurp And though you think that all as you have done Have torn their souls by turning them from us And we are barren and bereft of friends Yet know my master God omnipotent Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf Armies of pestilence and they shall strike Your children yet unborn and unbegot That lift your vassal hands against my head And threat the glory of my precious crown Tell Bolingbrokefor yon methinks he stands That every stride he makes upon my land Is dangerous treason He is come to open The purple testament"

let us not break with him For he will never follow anything That other men begin CASSIUS Then leave him out CASCA Indeed he is not fit DECIUS Shall no man else be touchd but only Caesar CASSIUS Decius well urgd I think it is not meet Mark Antony so well belovd of Caesar Should outlive Caesar we shall find of him A shrewd contriver and you know his means If he improve them may well stretch so far As to annoy us all which to prevent Let Antony and Caesar fall together BRUTUS Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards For Antony is but a limb of Caesar Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood O that we then could come by Caesars spirit And not dismember Caesar But alas Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends Lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully Lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods Not hew him as a

the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar BRUTUS Alas good Cassius do not think of him If he love Caesar all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar And that were much he should for he is given To sports to wildness and much company TREBONIUS There is no fear in him let him not die For he will live and laugh at this hereafter Clock strikes BRUTUS Peace count the clock CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three TREBONIUS Tis time to part CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no For he is superstitious grown of late Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustomd terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today DECIUS Never fear that if he be so resolved I can oersway him for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayd with trees And bears with glasses elephants with holes Lions with toils and men with flatterers But when I tell him he hates flatterers He says he does being then most flattered Let me work For I can give his humour the true bent And I will bring him to the Capitol CASSIUS Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him BRUTUS By the eighth hour is that the uttermost CINNA Be that the uttermost and fail not then METELLUS Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey I wonder none of you have thought of him BRUTUS Now good Metellus go along by him He loves me well and I have given him reason Send him but hither and Ill fashion him CASSIUS The morning comes upons Well leave you Brutus And friends disperse yourselves but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans BRUTUS Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily Let not our looks put on our

supper You suddenly arose and walkd about Musing and sighing with your arms across And when I askd you what the matter was You stard upon me with ungentle looks I urgd you further then you scratchd your head And too impatiently stampd with your foot Yet I insisted yet you answerd not But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you So I did Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seemd too much enkindled and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humour Which sometime hath his hour with every man It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevaild on your condition I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of grief BRUTUS I am not well in health and that is all PORTIA Brutus is wise and were he not in health He would embrace the means to come by it BRUTUS Why so I do Good Portia go to bed PORTIA Is Brutus sick and is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humours Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness No my Brutus You have some sick offence within your mind Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of and upon my knees I charm you by my once commended beauty By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me your self your half Why you are heavy and what men tonight Have had resort to you for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness BRUTUS Kneel not gentle Portia PORTIA I should not need if you were gentle Brutus Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you Am I your self But as it were in sort or limitation To keep with you at meals comfort your bed And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure If it be no more Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife BRUTUS You are my true and honourable wife As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart PORTIA If this were true then should I know this secret I grant I am a woman but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife I grant I am a woman but withal A woman well reputed Catos daughter Think you I am no stronger than my sex Being so fatherd and so husbanded Tell me your counsels I will not disclose em I have made strong proof of my constancyGiving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh can I bear that with patience And not my husbands secrets BRUTUS O ye gods Render me worthy of this noble wife Knock Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart All my engagements I will construe to thee All the charactery of my sad brows Leave me with haste Exit Portia Enter Lucius with Ligarius Lucius whos that knocks LUCIUS Here is a sick man that would speak with you BRUTUS Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how LIGARIUS Vouchsafe goodmorrow from a feeble tongue BRUTUS O what a time have you chose out brave Caius To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick LIGARIUS I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honour BRUTUS Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius Had you a healthful ear to hear of it LIGARIUS By all the gods that Romans bow before I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome Brave son derived from honourable loins Thou like an exorcist hast conjurd up My mortified spirit Now bid me run And I will strive with things impossible Yea get the better of them Whats to do BRUTUS A piece of work that will make sick men whole LIGARIUS But are not some whole that we must make sick BRUTUS That must we

success SERVANT I will my lord Exit Enter Calphurnia CALPHURNIA What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth You shall not stir out of your house today CAESAR Caesar shall forth The things that threatend me Neer lookd but on my back when they shall see The face of Caesar they are vanished CALPHURNIA Caesar I never stood on ceremonies Yet now they fright me There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch A lioness hath whelped in the streets And graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol The noise of battle hurtled in the air Horses did neigh and dying men did groan And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets O Caesar these things are beyond all use And I do fear them CAESAR What can be avoided Whose end is purposd by the mighty gods Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar CALPHURNIA When beggars die there are no comets seen The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes CAESAR Cowards die many times before their deaths The valiant never taste of death but once Of all the wonders that I yet have heard It seems to me most strange that men should fear Seeing that death a necessary end Will come when it will come Enter Servant What say the augurers SERVANT They would not have you to stir forth today Plucking the entrails of an offering forth They could not find a heart within the beast CAESAR The gods do this in shame of cowardice Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear No Caesar shall not Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he We are two lions litterd in one day And I the elder and more terrible And Caesar shall go forth CALPHURNIA Alas my lord Your wisdom is consumd in confidence Do not go forth today call it my fear That keeps you in the house and not your own Well send Mark Antony to the Senatehouse And he shall say you are not well today Let me upon my knee prevail in this CAESAR Mark Antony shall say I am not well And for thy humour I will stay at home Enter Decius Heres Decius Brutus he shall tell them so DECIUS Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar I come to fetch you to the Senatehouse CAESAR And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators And tell them that I will not come today Cannot is false and that I dare not falser I will not come today Tell them so Decius CALPHURNIA Say he is sick CAESAR Shall Caesar send a lie Have I in conquest stretchd mine arm so far To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth Decius go tell them Caesar will not come DECIUS Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause Lest I be laughd at when I tell them so CAESAR The cause is in my will I will not come That is enough to satisfy the Senate But for your private satisfaction Because I love you I will let you know Calphurnia here my wife stays me at home She dreamt tonight she saw my statue Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent and on her knee Hath beggd that I will stay at home today DECIUS This dream is all amiss interpreted It was a vision fair and fortunate Your statue spouting blood in many pipes In which so many smiling Romans bathd Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall press For tinctures stains relics and cognizance This by Calphurnias dream is signified CAESAR And this way have you well expounded it DECIUS I have when you have heard what I can say And know it now The Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar If you shall send them word you will not come Their minds may change Besides it were a mock Apt to be renderd for someone to say Break up the Senate till another time When Caesars wife shall meet with better dreams If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper Lo Caesar is afraid Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this And reason to my love is liable CAESAR How foolish do your fears seem now Calphurnia I am ashamed I did yield to them Give me my robe for I will go Enter Brutus Ligarius Metellus

wish I had been further CAESAR Good friends go in and taste some wine with me And we like friends will straightway go together BRUTUS Aside That every like is not the same O Caesar The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon Exeunt SCENE III A street near the Capitol Enter Artemidorus reading a paper ARTEMIDORUS Caesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast wrongd Caius Ligarius There is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against Caesar If thou best not immortal look about you security gives way to conspiracy The mighty gods defend thee Thy lover Artemidorus Here will I stand till Caesar pass along And as a suitor will I give him this My heart laments that virtue cannot live Out of the teeth of emulation If thou read this O Caesar thou mayest live If not the Fates with traitors do contrive Exit SCENE IV Another part of the same street

have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there Aside O constancy be strong upon my side Set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue I have a mans mind but a womans might How hard it is for women to keep counsel Art thou here yet LUCIUS Madam what should I do Run to the Capitol and nothing else And so return to you and nothing else PORTIA Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well For he went sickly forth and take good note What Caesar doth what suitors press to him Hark boy what noise is that LUCIUS I hear none madam PORTIA Prythee listen well I heard

house good lady PORTIA What ist oclock SOOTHSAYER About the ninth hour lady PORTIA Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol SOOTHSAYER Madam not yet I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol

thou any harms intended towards him SOOTHSAYER None that I know will be much that I fear may chance Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow The throng that follows Caesar at the heels Of Senators of Praetors common suitors Will crowd a feeble man almost to death Ill get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along Exit PORTIA I must go in Aside Ay me how weak a thing The heart of woman is O Brutus The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint Run Lucius and commend me to my lord

CAESAR I could be well movd if I were as you If I could pray to move prayers would move me But I am constant as the northern star Of whose truefixd and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament The skies are painted with unnumberd sparks They are all fire and every one doth shine But theres but one in all doth hold his place So in the world tis furnishd well with men And men are

Though now we must appear bloody and cruel As by our hands and this our present act You see we do yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done Our hearts you see not they are pitiful And pity to the general wrong of Rome As fire drives out fire so pity pity Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers temper do receive you in With all kind love good thoughts and reverence CASSIUS Your voice shall be as strong as any mans In the disposing of new dignities BRUTUS Only be patient till we have appeasd The multitude beside themselves with fear And then we will deliver you the cause Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him Have thus proceeded ANTONY I doubt

bloody fingers of thy foes Most noble in the presence of thy corse Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bayd brave hart Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand Signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe O world thou wast

Over thy wounds now do I prophesy Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue A curse shall light upon the limbs of men Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war All pity chokd with custom of fell deeds And Caesars spirit ranging for revenge With Ate by his side come hot from Hell Shall in these confines with a monarchs voice Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial Enter a Servant You serve Octavius Caesar do you not SERVANT I do Mark Antony ANTONY Caesar

with some of the Citizens Brutus goes into the rostrum THIRD CITIZEN The noble Brutus is ascended silence BRUTUS Be patient till the last Romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear Believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe Censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesars to him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all free men As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I slew him There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If any speak for him have I offended I pause for a reply CITIZENS None Brutus none BRUTUS Then none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is enrolld in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforcd for which he suffered death Enter Antony and others with Caesars body Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death CITIZENS Live Brutus live live FIRST CITIZEN Bring him with triumph home unto his house SECOND CITIZEN Give

are blest that Rome is rid of him SECOND CITIZEN Peace let us hear what Antony can say ANTONY You gentle Romans CITIZENS Peace ho let us hear him ANTONY Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears I come to bury Caesar not to praise him The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interred with their bones So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious If it were so it was a grievous fault And grievously hath Caesar answerd it Here under leave of Brutus and the rest For Brutus is an honourable man So are they all all honourable men Come I to speak in Caesars funeral He was my friend faithful and just to me But Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honourable man He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill Did this in Caesar seem ambitious When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept Ambition should be made of sterner stuff Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honourable man You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And sure he is an honourable man I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke But here I am to speak what I do know You all did love him once not without cause What cause withholds you then to mourn for him O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts And men have lost their reason Bear with me My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar And I must pause till it come back to me FIRST CITIZEN Methinks there is much reason in his sayings SECOND CITIZEN If thou consider rightly of the matter Caesar has had great wrong THIRD CITIZEN Has he masters I fear there will a worse come in his place FOURTH CITIZEN Markd ye his words He would not take the crown Therefore tis certain he was not ambitious FIRST CITIZEN If it be found so some will dear abide it SECOND CITIZEN Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping THIRD CITIZEN Theres"

these two beget A generation of stillbreeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermixed With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word as thus Come little ones And then again It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a needles eye Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they cannot die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortunes slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I kinged

are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dials point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack o the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that

GROOM So proudly as if he disdained the ground RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he

Messengers Ghosts Soldiers c SCENE England ACT I SCENE I London A street Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester alone RICHARD Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths Our bruised arms hung up for monuments Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings Our dreadful marches to delightful measures Grimvisaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front And now instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass I that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph I that am curtailed of this fair proportion Cheated of feature by dissembling nature Deformed unfinished sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them Why I in this weak piping time of peace Have no delight to pass away the time Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity And therefore since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair wellspoken days I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days Plots have I laid inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle false and treacherous This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that G Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes Enter Clarence guarded and Brakenbury Brother good day What means this armed guard That waits upon your Grace CLARENCE His Majesty Tendring my persons safety hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower RICHARD Upon what cause CLARENCE Because my name is George RICHARD Alack my lord that fault is none of yours He should for that commit your godfathers O belike his Majesty hath some intent That you should be newchristened in the Tower But whats the matter Clarence May I know CLARENCE Yea Richard when I know for I protest As yet I do not But as I can learn He hearkens after prophecies and dreams And from the crossrow plucks the letter G And says a wizard told him that by G His issue disinherited should be And for my name of George begins with G It follows in his thought that I am he These as I learn and such like toys as these Hath moved his Highness to commit me now RICHARD Why this it is when men are ruled by women Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower My Lady Grey his wife Clarence tis she That tempers him to this extremity Was it not she and that good man of worship Antony Woodville her brother there That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower From whence this present day he is delivered We are not safe Clarence we are not safe CLARENCE By heaven I think there is no man secure But the Queens kindred and nightwalking heralds That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore Heard you not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery RICHARD Humbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty Ill tell you what I think it is our way If we will keep in favour with the King To be her men and wear her livery The jealous oerworn widow and herself Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen Are mighty gossips in our monarchy BRAKENBURY I beseech your Graces both to pardon me His Majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference Of what degree soever with your brother RICHARD Even so an please your worship Brakenbury You may partake of anything we say We speak no treason man We say the King Is wise and virtuous and his noble Queen Well struck in years

RICHARD I know so But gentle Lady Anne To leave this keen encounter of our wits And fall something into a slower method Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward

Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine ANNE Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead RICHARD I would they were that I might die at once For now they kill me with a living death Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears Shamed their aspects with store of childish drops These eyes which never shed remorseful tear No when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When blackfaced Clifford shook his sword at him Nor when thy warlike father like a child Told the sad story of my fathers death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep That all the standersby had wet their cheeks Like trees bedashed with rain In that sad time My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping I never sued to friend nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word But now thy beauty is proposed my fee My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak She looks scornfully at him Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made For kissing lady not for such contempt If thy revengeful heart cannot forgiveLo here I lend thee this sharppointed sword Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee He kneels and lays his breast open she offers at

That was in thy rage Speak it again and even with the word This hand which for thy love did kill thy love Shall for thy love kill a far truer love To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary ANNE I would I knew thy heart RICHARD Tis figured in my tongue ANNE I fear me both are false RICHARD Then never was man true ANNE Well well put up your sword RICHARD Say then my peace is made ANNE That shalt thou know hereafter RICHARD But shall I live in hope ANNE All men I hope live so RICHARD Vouchsafe to wear this ring ANNE To take is not to give He places the ring on her hand RICHARD Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart Wear both of them for both of them are thine And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favour at thy gracious hand Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever ANNE What is it RICHARD That it may please you leave these sad designs To him that hath most cause to be a mourner And presently repair to Crosby Place Where after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monastery this noble King And wet his grave with my repentant tears I will with all expedient duty see you For divers unknown reasons I beseech you Grant me this boon ANNE With all my heart and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent Tressel and Berkeley go along with me RICHARD Bid me farewell ANNE Tis more than you deserve But since you teach me how to flatter you Imagine I have said farewell already Exeunt Lady Anne Tressel and Berkeley RICHARD Sirs take up the corse GENTLEMAN Towards Chertsey noble lord RICHARD No to White Friars there

months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewksbury A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman Framed in the prodigality of nature Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal The spacious world cannot again afford And will she yet abase her eyes on me That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed On me whose all not equals Edwards moiety On me that halt and am misshapen thus My dukedom to a beggarly denier I do mistake my person all this while Upon my life she finds although I cannot Myself to be a marvellous proper man Ill be at charges for a lookingglass And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body Since I am crept in favour with myself I will maintain it with some little cost But first Ill turn yon fellow in his grave

wingd thus swift with scorn Cannot outfly our apprehensions Much attribute he hath and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues Not virtuously on his own part beheld Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him We come to speak with him and you shall not sin If you do say we think him overproud And

expectation whirls me round Thimaginary relish is so sweet That it enchants my sense what will it be When that the watry palate tastes indeed Loves thricerepured nectar Death I fear me Sounding

Fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly CRESSIDA Blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear To fear the worst oft cures the worse TROILUS O let my lady apprehend no fear In all Cupids pageant there is presented no monster CRESSIDA Nor nothing monstrous neither TROILUS Nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed This is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confind that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit CRESSIDA They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters TROILUS Are there such Such are not we Praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present We will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble Few words to fair faith Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer

brings me heart Prince Troilus I have lovd you night and day For many weary months TROILUS Why was my Cressid then so hard to win CRESSIDA Hard to seem won but I was won my lord With the first glance that everpardon me If I confess much you will play the tyrant I love you now but till now not so much But I might master it In faith I lie My thoughts were like unbridled children grown Too headstrong for their mother See we fools Why have I blabbd Who shall be true to us When we are so unsecret to ourselves But though I lovd you well I wood you not And yet good faith I wishd myself a man Or that we women had mens privilege Of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue For in this rapture I shall surely speak The thing I shall repent See see your silence Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws My very soul of counsel Stop my mouth TROILUS And shall albeit sweet music issues thence PANDARUS Pretty i faith CRESSIDA My lord I do beseech you pardon me Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss I am ashamd O heavens what have I done For this time will I take my leave my lord TROILUS Your leave sweet Cressid PANDARUS Leave And you take leave till tomorrow morning CRESSIDA Pray you content you TROILUS What offends you lady CRESSIDA Sir mine own company TROILUS You cannot shun yourself CRESSIDA Let me go and try I have a kind of self resides with you But an unkind self that itself will leave To be anothers fool I would be gone Where is my wit I know not what I speak TROILUS Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely CRESSIDA Perchance my lord I show more craft than love And fell so roundly to a large confession To angle for your thoughts but you are wise Or else you love not for to be wise and love Exceeds mans might that dwells with gods above TROILUS O that I thought it could be in a woman As if it can I will presume in you To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love To keep her constancy in plight and youth Outliving beautys outward with a mind That doth renew swifter than blood decays Or that persuasion could but thus convince me That my integrity and truth to you Might be affronted with the match and weight Of such a winnowed purity in love How were I then uplifted But alas I am as true as truths simplicity And simpler than the infancy of truth CRESSIDA In that Ill war with you TROILUS O virtuous fight When right with right wars who shall be most right True swains in love shall in the world to come Approve their truth by Troilus when their rhymes Full of protest of oath and big compare Want similes truth tird with iteration As true as steel as plantage to the moon As sun to day as turtle to her mate As iron to adamant as earth to th centre Yet after all comparisons of truth As truths authentic author to be cited As true as Troilus shall crown up the verse And sanctify the numbers CRESSIDA Prophet may you be If I be false or swerve a hair from truth When time is old and hath forgot itself When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy And blind oblivion swallowd cities up And mighty states characterless are grated To dusty nothingyet let memory From false to false among false maids in love Upbraid my falsehood when th have said As false As air as water wind or sandy earth As fox to lamb or wolf to heifers calf Pard to the hind or stepdame to her son Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood As false as Cressid PANDARUS Go to a bargain made seal it seal it Ill be the witness Here I hold your hand here my cousins If ever you prove false one to another since I have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goersbetween be calld to the worlds end after my namecall them all Pandars let all constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids and all brokers between Pandars Say Amen

have desire to drink It may do good Pride hath no other glass To show itself but pride for supple knees Feed arrogance and are the proud mans fees AGAMEMNON Well execute your purpose and put on A form

westward rooteth from this city side So early walking did I see your son Towards him I made but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood I measuring his affections by my own Which then most sought where most might not be found Being one too many by my weary self Pursud my humour not pursuing his And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me MONTAGUE Many a morning hath he there been seen With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs But all so soon as the allcheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains

sun under the dovehouse wall My lord and you were then at Mantua Nay I do bear a brain But as I said When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug Shake quoth the dovehouse twas no need I trow To bid me trudge And since that time it is eleven years For then she could stand alone nay by throod She could have run

prologue faintly spoke After the prompter for our entrance But let them measure us by what they will Well measure them a measure and be gone ROMEO Give me a torch I am not for this ambling Being but heavy I will bear the light MERCUTIO Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance ROMEO Not I believe me you have dancing shoes With nimble soles I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move MERCUTIO You are a lover borrow Cupids wings And soar with them above a common bound ROMEO I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe Under loves heavy burden do I sink MERCUTIO And to sink in it should you burden love Too great oppression for a tender thing ROMEO Is love a tender thing It is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn MERCUTIO If love be rough with you be rough with love Prick love for pricking and you beat love down Give me a case to put my visage in Putting on a mask A visor for a visor What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities Here are the beetlebrows shall blush for me BENVOLIO Come knock and enter and no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs ROMEO A torch for me let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels For I am proverbd with a grandsire phrase Ill be a candleholder and look on The game was neer so fair and I

asleep while they do dream things true MERCUTIO O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you She is the fairies midwife and she comes In shape no bigger than an agatestone On the forefinger of an alderman Drawn with a team of little atomies Over mens noses as they lie asleep Her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs The cover of the wings of grasshoppers Her traces of the smallest spiders web The collars of the moonshines watery beams Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film Her waggoner a small greycoated gnat Not half so big as a round little worm Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains and then they dream of love Oer courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straight Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees Oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep Then dreams he of another benefice Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats Of breaches ambuscados Spanish blades Of healths five fathom deep and then anon Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs Which once untangled much misfortune bodes This is the hag when maids lie on their backs That presses them and learns them first to bear Making them women of good carriage This is she ROMEO Peace peace Mercutio peace Thou talkst of nothing MERCUTIO True I talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Begot of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north And being angerd puffs away from thence Turning his side to the dewdropping south BENVOLIO This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves Supper is done and we shall come too lateROMEO I fear too early for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this nights revels and expire the term Of a despised life closd in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death But he that hath the steerage of my course Direct my suit On lusty gentlemen BENVOLIO Strike drum Exeunt SCENE V A Hall in Capulets House Musicians waiting Enter Servants FIRST SERVANT Wheres Potpan that he helps not to take away He shift a

which love groand for and would die With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair Now Romeo is belovd and loves again Alike bewitched by the charm of looks But to his foe supposd he must complain And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks Being held a foe he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear And she as much in love her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere But passion lends them power time means to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet Exit SCENE I An open place adjoining Capulets Garden Enter Romeo ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out He climbs the wall and leaps down within it Enter Benvolio and Mercutio BENVOLIO Romeo My cousin Romeo Romeo MERCUTIO He is wise And on my life

trim When King Cophetua lovd the beggarmaid He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not The ape is dead and I must conjure him I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes By her high forehead and her scarlet lip By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh And the demesnes that there adjacent lie That in thy likeness thou appear to us BENVOLIO An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him MERCUTIO This cannot anger him Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress circle Of some strange nature letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjurd it down That were some spite My invocation Is fair and honest and in his mistress name I conjure only but to raise up him BENVOLIO Come he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night Blind is his love and best befits the dark MERCUTIO If love be blind love cannot hit the mark Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone O Romeo that she were O that she were An openarse and thou a poperin pear Romeo good night Ill to my trucklebed This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep Come shall we go BENVOLIO Go then for tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found Exeunt SCENE II Capulets Garden Enter Romeo ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound Juliet appears above at a window But soft what light through yonder window breaks It is the east and Juliet is the sun Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she Be not her maid since she is envious Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it cast it off It is my lady O it is my love O that she knew she were She speaks yet she says nothing What of that Her eye discourses I will answer it I am too bold tis not to me she speaks Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return What if her eyes were there they in her head The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night See how she leans her cheek upon her hand O that I were a glove upon that handThat I might touch that cheek JULIET Ay me ROMEO She speaks O speak again bright angel for thou art As glorious to this night being oer my head As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazypuffing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air JULIET O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo Deny thy father and refuse thy name Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love And Ill no longer be a Capulet ROMEO Aside Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this JULIET Tis but thy name that is my enemy Thou art thyself though not a Montague Whats Montague It is nor hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man O be some other name Whats in a name That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title Romeo doff thy name And for thy name which is no part of thee Take all myself ROMEO I take thee at thy word Call me but love and Ill be new baptisd Henceforth I never will be Romeo JULIET What man art thou that thus bescreend in night So stumblest on my counsel ROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am My name dear saint is hateful to myself Because it is"

moon BRUTUS The present wars devour him He is grown Too proud to be so valiant SICINIUS Such a nature Tickled with good success disdains the shadow Which he treads on at noon But I do wonder His insolence can brook to be commanded Under Cominius BRUTUS Fame at the which he aims In whom already hes well graced cannot Better be held nor more attained than by A place below the first for what miscarries Shall be the Generals fault though he perform To th utmost of a man and giddy censure Will then cry out of Martius O if he Had borne the business SICINIUS Besides if things go well Opinion that so sticks on Martius shall Of his demerits rob Cominius BRUTUS Come Half all Cominius honours are to Martius Though Martius earned them not and all his faults To Martius shall be honours though

is of Rome worse hated than of you And Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman These three lead on this preparation Whither tis bent Most likely tis for you Consider of it FIRST SENATOR Our armys in the field We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready To answer us AUFIDIUS Nor did you think it folly To keep your great pretences veiled till when They needs must show themselves which in the hatching It seemed appeared to Rome By the discovery We shall be shortened in our aim which was To take in many towns ere almost Rome Should know we were afoot SECOND SENATOR Noble Aufidius Take your commission hie you to your bands Let us alone to guard Corioles If they set down befores for the remove Bring up your army But I think youll find Theyve not prepared for us AUFIDIUS O doubt not that I speak from

youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding I considering how honour would become such a personthat it was no better than picturelike to hang by th wall if renown made it not stirwas pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame To a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak I tell thee daughter I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man VIRGILIA But had he died in the business madam how then VOLUMNIA Then his good report should have been my son I therein would have found issue Hear me profess sincerely had I a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good

give me leave to retire myselfVOLUMNIA Indeed you shall not Methinks I hear hither your husbands drum See him pluck Aufidius down by th hair As children from a bear the Volsces shunning him Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus Come on you cowards You were got in fear Though you were born in Rome His bloody brow With his mailed hand then wiping forth he goes Like to a harvestman thats tasked to mow Or all or lose his hire VIRGILIA His bloody brow O Jupiter no blood VOLUMNIA Away you fool It more becomes a man Than gilt his trophy The breasts of Hecuba When she did suckle Hector looked not lovelier Than Hectors forehead when it spit forth blood At Grecian sword contemningTell Valeria We are fit to bid her welcome Exit Gentlewoman VIRGILIA Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius

hour together Has such a confirmed countenance I saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes and up again catched it

forsworn And een that power which gave me first my oath Provokes me to this threefold perjury Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear O sweetsuggesting Love if thou hast sinned Teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it At first I did adore a twinkling star But now I worship a celestial sun Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken And he wants wit that wants resolved will To learn his wit t exchange the bad for better Fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred With twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths I cannot leave to love and yet I do But there I leave to love where I should love Julia I lose and Valentine I lose If I keep them I needs must lose myself If I lose them thus find I by their loss For Valentine myself for Julia Silvia I to myself am dearer than a friend For love is still most precious in itself And Silviawitness heaven that made her fair Shows Julia but a swarthy EthiopeI will forget that Julia is alive Remembering that my love to her is dead And Valentine Ill hold an enemy Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend I cannot now prove constant to myself Without some treachery used to Valentine This night he meaneth with a corded ladder To climb celestial Silvias chamber window Myself in counsel his competitor Now presently Ill give her father notice Of their disguising and pretended flight Who all enraged will banish

table wherein all my thoughts Are visibly charactered and engraved To lesson me and tell me some good mean How with my honour I may undertake A journey to my loving Proteus LUCETTA Alas the way is wearisome and long JULIA A truedevoted pilgrim is not weary To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps Much less shall she that hath Loves wings to fly And when the flight is made to one so dear Of such divine perfection as Sir Proteus LUCETTA Better forbear till Proteus make return JULIA O knowst thou not his looks are my souls food Pity the dearth that I have pined in By longing for that food so long a time Didst thou but know the inly touch of love Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with words LUCETTA I do not seek to quench your loves hot fire But qualify the fires extreme rage Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason JULIA The more thou dammst it up the more it burns The current that with gentle murmur glides Thou knowst being stopped impatiently doth rage But when his fair course is not hindered He makes sweet music with th enamelled stones Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage And so by many winding nooks he strays With willing sport to the wild ocean Then let me go and hinder not my course Ill be as patient as a gentle stream And make a pastime of each weary step Till the last step have brought me to my love And there Ill rest as after much turmoil A blessed soul doth in Elysium LUCETTA But in what habit will you go along JULIA Not like a woman for I would prevent The loose encounters of lascivious men Gentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds As may beseem some wellreputed page LUCETTA Why then your ladyship must cut your hair JULIA No girl Ill knit it up in silken strings With twenty oddconceited truelove knots To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater time than I shall show to be LUCETTA What fashion madam shall I make your breeches JULIA That fits as well as Tell me good my lord What compass will you wear your farthingale Why een what fashion thou best likes Lucetta LUCETTA You must needs have them with a codpiece madam JULIA Out out Lucetta that will be illfavoured LUCETTA A round hose madam nows not worth a pin Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on JULIA Lucetta as thou lovst me let me have What thou thinkst meet and is most mannerly But tell me wench how will the world repute me For undertaking so unstaid a journey I fear me it will make me scandalized LUCETTA If you think so then stay at home and go not JULIA Nay that I will not LUCETTA Then never dream on infamy but go If Proteus like your journey when you come No matter whos displeased when you are gone I fear me he will scarce be pleased withal JULIA That is the least Lucetta of my fear A thousand oaths an ocean of his tears And instances of infinite of love Warrant me welcome to my Proteus LUCETTA All these are servants to deceitful men JULIA Base men that use them to so base effect But truer stars did govern Proteus birth His words are bonds his oaths are oracles His love sincere his thoughts immaculate His tears pure messengers sent from his heart His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth LUCETTA Pray heavn he prove so when you come to him JULIA Now as thou lovst me do him not that wrong To bear a hard opinion of his truth Only deserve my love by loving him And presently go with me to my chamber To take a note of what I stand in need of To furnish me upon my longing journey All that is mine I leave at thy dispose My goods my lands my reputation Only

Thurio give us leave I pray awhile We have some secrets to confer about Exit Thurio Now tell me Proteus whats your will with me PROTEUS My gracious lord that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me undeserving as I am My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend This night intends to steal away your daughter Myself am one made privy to the plot I know you have determined to bestow her On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates And should she thus be stoln away from you It would be much vexation to your age Thus for my dutys sake I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than by concealing it heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down Being unprevented to your timeless grave DUKE Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care Which to requite command me while I live This love of theirs myself have often seen Haply when they have judged me fast asleep And oftentimes have purposed to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so unworthily disgrace the man A rashness that I ever yet have shunned I gave him gentle looks thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosed to me And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested I nightly lodge her in an upper tower The key whereof myself have ever kept And thence she cannot be conveyed away PROTEUS Know noble lord they have devised a mean How he her chamberwindow will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down For which the youthful lover now is gone And this way comes he with it presently Where if it please you you may intercept him But good my lord do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at For love of you not hate unto my friend Hath made me publisher of this pretence DUKE Upon mine honour he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this PROTEUS Adieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming Exit Enter Valentine DUKE Sir Valentine whither away so fast VALENTINE Please it your Grace there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends And I am going to deliver them DUKE Be they of much import VALENTINE The tenor of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court DUKE Nay then no matter Stay with me awhile I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near wherein thou must be secret Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter VALENTINE I know it well my lord and sure the match Were rich and honourable Besides the gentleman Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter Cannot your grace win her to fancy him DUKE No trust me she is peevish sullen froward Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty Neither regarding that she is my child Nor fearing me as if I were her father And may I say to thee this pride of hers Upon advice hath drawn my love from her And where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherished by her childlike duty I now am full resolved to take a wife And turn her out to who will take her in Then let her beauty be her wedding dower For me and my possessions she esteems not VALENTINE What would your Grace have me to do in this DUKE There is a lady of Verona here Whom I affect but she is nice and coy And nought esteems my aged eloquence Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor For long agone I have forgot to court Besides the fashion of the time is changed How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sunbright eye VALENTINE Win her with gifts if she respect not words Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a womans mind DUKE But she did scorn a present that I sent her VALENTINE A woman sometime scorns what best contents her Send her another never give her oer For scorn at first makes afterlove the more If she do frown tis not in hate of you But rather to beget more love in you If she do chide tis not to have you gone Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone Take no repulse whatever she doth say For Get you gone she doth not mean Away Flatter and praise commend extol their graces Though neer so black say they have angels faces That man that hath a tongue I say is no man If with his tongue he cannot win a woman DUKE But she I mean is promised by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth And kept severely from resort of men That no man hath access by day to her VALENTINE Why then I would resort to her by night DUKE Ay but the doors be locked and keys kept safe That no man hath recourse to her by night VALENTINE What lets but one may enter at her window DUKE Her chamber is aloft far from the ground And built so shelving that one cannot climb it Without apparent hazard of his life VALENTINE Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks Would serve to scale another Heros tower So bold Leander would adventure it DUKE Now as thou art a gentleman of blood Advise me where I may have such a ladder VALENTINE When would you use it Pray sir tell me that DUKE This very night for Love is like a child That longs for everything that he can come by VALENTINE By seven oclock Ill get you such a ladder DUKE But hark thee I will go to her alone How shall I best convey the ladder thither VALENTINE It will be light my lord that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length DUKE A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn VALENTINE Ay my good lord DUKE Then let me see thy cloak Ill get me one of such another length VALENTINE Why any cloak will serve the turn my lordDUKE How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me Takes Valentines cloak and finds a letter and a rope ladder concealed under it What letter is this same Whats hereTo Silvia And here an engine fit for my proceeding Ill be so bold to break the seal for once Reads My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly And slaves they are to me that send them flying O could their master come and go as lightly Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them While I their king that thither them importune Do curse the grace that with such grace hath

admiration They seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes There was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed A notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if th importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more Enter a Gentleman The news Rogero SECOND GENTLEMAN Nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it Here comes the Lady Paulinas steward he can deliver you more Enter a third Gentleman How goes it now sir This news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion Has the king found his heir THIRD GENTLEMAN Most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance That which you hear youll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs The mantle of Queen Hermiones her jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter Did you see the meeting of the two kingsSECOND GENTLEMAN No THIRD GENTLEMAN Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of There might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears There was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries O thy mother thy mother then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns I never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it SECOND GENTLEMAN What pray you became of Antigonus that carried hence the child THIRD GENTLEMAN Like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open He was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherds son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows FIRST GENTLEMAN What became of his bark and his followers THIRD GENTLEMAN Wrecked the same instant of their masters death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found But O the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled She lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing FIRST GENTLEMAN The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted THIRD GENTLEMAN One of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an Alas I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood

princess hearing of her mothers statue which is in the keeping of Paulinaa piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile Nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup SECOND GENTLEMAN I thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing FIRST GENTLEMAN Who would be thence that has the benefit of access Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge Lets along Exeunt Gentlemen AUTOLYCUS Now had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head I

relishd among my other discredits Enter Shepherd and Clown Here come those I have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune SHEPHERD Come boy I am past more children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born CLOWN You are well met sir You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born See you these clothes Say you see

swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but Ill swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands AUTOLYCUS I will prove so sir to my power CLOWN Ay by any means prove a tall fellow if I do not wonder how thou darst venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow

Is trothplight to your daughter Good Paulina Lead us from hence where we may leisurely Each one demand and answer to his part Performd in this wide gap of time since first We were disseverd Hastily lead away Exeunt A LOVERS COMPLAINT From off a hill whose concave womb reworded A plaintful story from a sistring vale My spirits tattend this double voice accorded And down I laid to list the sadtund tale Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale Tearing of papers breaking rings atwain Storming her world with sorrows wind and rain Upon her head a platted hive of straw Which fortified her visage from the sun Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw The carcass of a beauty spent and done Time had not scythed all that youth begun Nor youth all quit but spite of heavens fell rage Some beauty peeped through lattice of seard age Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne Which on it had conceited characters Laundring the silken figures in the brine That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears And often reading what contents it bears As often shrieking undistinguishd woe In clamours of all size both high and low Sometimes her levelld eyes their carriage ride As they did battry to the spheres intend Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied To thorbed earth sometimes they do extend Their view right on anon their gazes lend To every place at once and nowhere fixd The mind and sight distractedly commixd Her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat Proclaimd in her a careless hand of pride For some untuckd descended her sheavd hat Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside Some in her threaden fillet still did bide And true to bondage would not break from thence Though slackly braided in loose negligence A thousand favours from a maund she drew Of amber crystal and of beaded jet Which one by one she in a river threw Upon whose weeping margent she was set Like usury applying wet to wet Or monarchs hands that lets not bounty fall Where want cries some but where excess begs all Of folded schedules had she many a one Which she perusd sighd tore and gave the flood Crackd many a ring of posied gold and bone Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud Found yet mo letters sadly pennd in blood With sleided silk feat and affectedly Enswathd and seald to curious secrecy These often bathd she in her fluxive eyes And often kissd and often gave to tear Cried O false blood thou register of lies What unapproved witness dost thou bear Ink would have seemd more black and damned here This said in top of rage the lines she rents Big discontent so breaking their contents A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew Of court of city and had let go by The swiftest hours observed as they flew Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew And privilegd by age desires to know In brief the grounds and motives of her woe So slides he down upon his grained bat And comely distant sits he by her side When he again desires her being sat Her grievance with his hearing to divide If that from him there may be aught applied Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage Tis promised in the charity of age Father she says though in me you behold The injury of many a blasting hour Let it not tell your judgement I am old Not age but sorrow over me hath power I might as yet have been a spreading flower Fresh to myself if I had selfapplied Love to myself and to no love beside But woe is me Too early I attended A youthful suit it was to gain my grace O one by natures outwards so commended That maidens eyes stuck over all his face Love lackd a dwelling and made him her place And when in his fair parts she did abide She was new lodgd and newly deified His browny locks did hang in crooked curls And every light occasion of the wind Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls Whats sweet to do to do will aptly find Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind For on his visage was in little drawn What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn Small show of man was yet upon his chin His phoenix down began but to appear Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin Whose bare outbraggd the web it seemed to wear Yet showd his visage by that cost more dear And nice affections wavering stood in doubt If best were as it was or best without His qualities were beauteous as his form For maidentongued he was and thereof free Yet if men movd him was he such a storm As oft twixt May and April is to see When winds breathe sweet unruly though they be His rudeness so with his authorizd youth Did livery falseness in a pride of truth Well could he ride and often men would say That horse his mettle from his rider takes Proud of subjection noble by the sway What rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes And controversy hence a question takes Whether the horse by him became his deed Or he his manage by th welldoing steed But quickly on this side the verdict went His real habitude gave life and grace To appertainings and to ornament Accomplishd in himself not in his case All aids themselves made fairer by their place Came for additions yet their purposd trim Piecd not his grace but were all gracd by him So on the tip of his subduing tongue All kind of arguments and question deep All replication prompt and reason strong For his advantage still did wake and sleep To make the weeper laugh the laugher weep He had the dialect and different skill Catching all passions in his craft of will That he did in the general bosom reign Of young of old and sexes both enchanted To dwell with him in thoughts or to remain In personal duty following where he haunted Consents bewitchd ere he desire have granted And dialogued for him what he would say Askd their own wills and made their wills obey Many there were that did his picture get To serve their eyes and in it put their mind Like fools that in th imagination set The goodly objects which abroad they find Of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them So many have that never touchd his hand Sweetly supposd them mistress of his heart My woeful self that did in freedom stand And was my own feesimple not in part What with his art in youth and youth in art Threw my affections in his charmed power Reservd the stalk and gave him all my flower Yet did I not as some my equals did Demand of him nor being desired yielded Finding myself in honour so forbid With safest distance I mine honour shielded Experience for me many bulwarks builded Of proofs newbleeding which remaind the foil Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil But ah Who ever shunnd by precedent The destind ill she must herself assay Or forced examples gainst her own content To put the bypassd perils in her way Counsel may stop a while what will not stay For when we rage advice is often seen By blunting us to make our wills more keen Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood That we must curb it upon others proof To be forbode the sweets that seems so good For fear of harms that preach in our behoof O appetite from judgement stand aloof The one a palate hath that needs will taste Though reason weep and cry It is thy last For further I could say This mans untrue And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling Heard where his plants in others orchards grew Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling Thought characters and words merely but artAnd bastards of his foul adulterate heart And long upon these terms I held my city Till thus he gan besiege me Gentle maid Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity And be not of my holy vows afraid Thats to ye sworn to none was ever said For feasts of love I have been calld unto Till now did neer invite nor never woo All my offences that abroad you see Are errors of the blood none of the mind Love made them not with acture they may be Where neither party is nor true nor kind They sought their shame that so their shame did find And so much less of shame in me remains By how much of me their reproach contains Among the many that mine eyes have seen Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed Or my affection put to th smallest teen Or any of my leisures ever charmed Harm have I done to them but neer was harmed Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free And reignd commanding in his monarchy Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and blushes aptly understood In bloodless white and the encrimsond mood Effects of terror and dear modesty Encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly And lo behold these talents of their hair With twisted metal amorously empleachd I have receivd from many a several fair Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd With th annexions of fair gems enrichd And deepbraind sonnets that did amplify Each stones dear nature worth and quality The diamond why twas beautiful and hard Whereto his invisd properties did tend The deep green emerald in whose fresh regard Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend The heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend With objects manifold each several stone With wit well blazond smild or made some moan Lo all these trophies of affections hot Of pensivd and subdued desires the tender Nature hath chargd me that I hoard them not But yield them up where I myself must render That is to you my origin and ender For these of force must your oblations be Since I their altar you empatron me O then advance of yours that phraseless hand Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise Take all these similes to your own command Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise What me your minister for you obeys Works under you and to your audit comes Their distract parcels in combined sums Lo this device was sent me from a nun Or sister sanctified of holiest note Which late her noble suit in court did shun Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote For she was sought by spirits of richest coat But kept cold distance and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love But O my sweet what labour ist to leave The thing we have not mastring what not strives Planing the place which did no form receive Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves She that her fame so to herself contrives The scars of battle scapeth by the flight And makes her absence valiant not her might O pardon me in that my boast is true The accident which brought me to her eye Upon the moment did her force subdue And now she would the caged cloister fly Religious love put out religions eye Not to be tempted would she be immurd And now to tempt all liberty procurd How mighty then you are O hear me tell The broken bosoms that to me belong Have emptied all their fountains in my well And mine I pour your ocean all among I strong oer them and you oer me being strong Must for your victory us all congest As compound love to physic your cold breast My parts had powr to charm a sacred nun Who disciplind and dieted in grace Believd her eyes when they tassail begun All vows and consecrations giving place O most potential love Vow bond nor space In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine For thou art all and all things else are thine When thou impressest what are precepts worth Of stale example When thou wilt inflame How coldly those impediments stand forth Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame Loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame And sweetens in the suffring pangs it bears The aloes of all forces shocks and fears Now all these hearts that do on mine depend Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine And supplicant their sighs to your extend To leave the battry that you make gainst mine Lending soft audience to my sweet design And credent soul to that strongbonded oath That shall prefer and undertake my troth This said his watry eyes he did dismount Whose sights till then were levelld on my face Each cheek a river running from a fount With brinish current downward flowed apace O how the channel to the stream gave grace Who glazd with crystal gate the glowing roses That flame through water which their hue encloses O father what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small orb of one particular tear But with the inundation of the eyes What rocky heart to water will not wear What breast so cold that is not warmed here O cleft effect Cold modesty hot wrath Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath For lo his passion but an art of craft Even there resolvd my reason into tears There my white stole of chastity I daffd Shook off my sober guards and civil fears Appear to him as he to me appears All melting though our drops this diffrence bore His poisond me and mine did him restore In him a plenitude of subtle matter Applied to cautels all strange forms receives Of burning blushes or of weeping water Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves In eithers aptness as it best deceives To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows That not a heart which in his level came Could scape the hail of his allhurting aim Showing fair nature is both kind and tame And veild in them did win whom he would maim Against the thing he sought he would exclaim When he most burned in heartwishd luxury He preachd pure maid and praisd cold chastity Thus merely with the garment of a grace The naked and concealed fiend he coverd That thunexperient gave the tempter place Which like a cherubin above them hoverd Who young and simple would not be so loverd Ay me I fell and yet do question make What I should do again for such a sake O that infected moisture of his eye O that false fire which in his cheek so glowd O that forcd thunder from his heart did fly O that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowd O all that borrowed motion seeming owed Would yet again betray the forebetrayed And new pervert a reconciled maid THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM I When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutord youth Unskilful in the worlds false forgeries Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although I know my years be past the best I smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue Outfacing faults in love with loves ill rest But wherefore says my love that she is young And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is a soothing tongue And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore Ill lie with love and love with me Since that our faults in love thus smotherd be II Two loves I have of comfort and despair That like two spirits do suggest me still My better angel is a man right fair My worser spirit a woman colourd ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her fair pride And whether that my angel be turnd fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell For being both to me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell The truth I shall not know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out III Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye Gainst whom the world could not hold argument Persuade my heart to this false perjury Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment A woman I forswore but I will prove Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee My vow was earthly thou a heavenly love Thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me My vow was breath and breath a vapour is Then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine Exhale this vapour vow in thee it is If broken then it is no fault of mine If by me broke what fool is not so wise To break an oath to win a paradise IV Sweet Cytherea sitting by a brook With young Adonis lovely fresh and green Did court the lad with many a lovely look Such looks as none could look but beautys queen She told him stories to delight his ear She showd him favours to allure his eye To win his heart she touchd him here and there Touches so soft still conquer chastity But whether unripe years did want conceit Or he refusd to take her figurd proffer The tender nibbler would not touch the bait But smile and jest at every gentle offer Then fell she on her back fair queen and toward He rose and ran away ah fool too froward V If love make me forsworn how shall I swear to love O never faith could hold if not to beauty vowed Though to myself forsworn to thee Ill constant prove Those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bowed Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend If knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire Thine eye Joves lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder Which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire Celestial as thou art O do not love that wrong To sing heavens praise with such an earthly tongue VI Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade When Cytherea all in love forlorn A longing tarriance for Adonis made Under an osier growing by a brook A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen Hot was the day she hotter that did look For his approach that often there had been Anon he comes and throws his mantle by And stood stark naked on the brooks green brim The sun lookd on the world with glorious eye Yet not so wistly as this queen on him He spying her bouncd in whereas he stood O Jove quoth she why was not I a flood VII Fair is my love but not so fair as fickle Mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty Brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittleSofter than wax and yet as iron rusty A lily pale with damask dye to grace her None fairer nor none falser to deface her Her lips to mine how often hath she joined Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing How many tales to please me hath she coined Dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings Her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings She burnt with love as straw with fire flameth She burnt out love as soon as straw outburneth She framd the love and yet she foild the framing She bade love last and yet she fell aturning Was this a lover or a lecher whether Bad in the best though excellent in neither VIII If music and sweet poetry agree As they must needs the sister and the brother Then must the love be great twixt thee and me Because thou lovst the one and I the other Dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch Upon the lute doth ravish human sense Spenser to me whose deep conceit is such As passing all conceit needs no defence Thou lovst to hear the sweet melodious sound That Phbus lute the queen of music makes And I in deep delight am chiefly drownd Whenas himself to singing he betakes One god is god of both as poets feign One knight loves both and both in thee remain IX Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love Paler for sorrow than her milkwhite dove For Adons sake a youngster proud and wild Her stand she takes upon a steepup hill Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds She silly queen with more than loves good will Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds Once quoth she did I see a fair sweet youth Here in these brakes deepwounded with a boar Deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth See in my thigh quoth she here was the sore She showed hers he saw more wounds than one And blushing fled and left her all alone X Sweet rose fair flower untimely pluckd soon vaded Pluckd in the bud and vaded in the spring Bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded Fair creature killd too soon by deaths sharp sting Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree And falls through wind before the fall should be I weep for thee and yet no cause I have For why thou leftst me nothing in thy will And yet thou leftst me more than I did crave For why I craved nothing of thee still O yes dear friend I pardon crave of thee Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me XI Venus with young Adonis sitting by her Under a myrtle shade began to woo him She told the youngling how god Mars did try her And as he fell to her she fell to him Even thus quoth she the warlike god embracd me And then she clippd Adonis in her arms Even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me As if the boy should use like loving charms Even thus quoth she he seized on my lips And with her lips on his did act the seizure And as she fetched breath away he skips And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure Ah that I had my lady at this bay To kiss and clip me till I run away XII Crabbed age and youth cannot live together Youth is full of pleasance age is full of care Youth like summer morn age like winter weather Youth like summer brave age like winter bare Youth is full of sport ages breath is short Youth is nimble age is lame Youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold Youth is wild and age is tame Age I do abhor thee youth I do adore thee O my love my love is young Age I do defy thee O sweet shepherd hie thee For methinks thou stayst too long XIII Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly A flower that dies when first it gins to bud A brittle glass thats broken presently A doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower Lost vaded broken dead within an hour And as goods lost are seld or never found As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh As flowers dead lie witherd on the ground As broken glass no cement can redress So beauty blemishd once for evers lost In spite of physic painting pain and cost XIV Good night good rest Ah neither be my share She bade good night that kept my rest away And daffd me to a cabin hangd with care To descant on the doubts of my decay Farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow Fare well I could not for I suppd with sorrow Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile In scorn or friendship nill I conster whether T may be she joyd to jest at my exile T may be again to make me wander thither Wander a word for shadows like myself"

competitor From Alexandria This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he hardly gave audience or Vouchsafed to think he had partners You shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults That all men follow LEPIDUS I must not think there are Evils enough to darken all his goodness His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven More fiery by nights blackness hereditary Rather than purchased what he cannot change Than what he chooses CAESAR You are too indulgent Lets grant it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of PtolemyTo give a kingdom for a mirth to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat Say this becomes him As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemishyet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him fort But to confound such time That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud As his own state and

Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once Was beaten from Modena where thou slewst Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel Did famine follow whom thou foughtst against Though daintily brought up with patience more Than savages could suffer Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets The barks of trees thou browsed On the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh Which some did die to look on And all this It wounds thine honour that I speak it now Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek So much as lanked not LEPIDUS Tis pity of him CAESAR Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i th field and to that end Assemble we immediate council Pompey Thrives in our idleness LEPIDUS Tomorrow Caesar I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this

for wotst thou whom thou movst The demiAtlas of this earth the arm And burgonet of men Hes speaking now Or murmuring Wheres my serpent of old Nile For so he calls me Now I feed myself With most delicious poison Think on me That am with Phbus amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time Broadfronted Caesar When thou wast here above the ground I was A morsel for a monarch And great Pompey

that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypts widow pluck The neer lustwearied Antony MENAS I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together His wife thats dead did trespasses to Caesar His brother warred upon him although I think Not moved by Antony POMPEY I know not Menas How lesser enmities may give way to greater Weret not that we stand up against them all Twere pregnant they should

you practised CAESAR You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me Your wife and brother Made wars upon me and their contestation Was theme for you you were the word of war ANTONY You do mistake your business My brother never Did urge me in his act I did inquire it And have my learning from some true reports That drew their swords with you Did he not rather Discredit my

It must not be with this CAESAR You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me but You patched up your excuses ANTONY Not so not so I know you could not lackI am certain ont Very necessity of

bound me up From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may Ill play the penitent to you But mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power Work without it Truth is that Fulvia To have me out of Egypt made wars here For which myself the ignorant motive do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case LEPIDUS Tis noble spoken MAECENAS If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you LEPIDUS Worthily spoken Maecenas ENOBARBUS Or if you borrow one anothers love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do ANTONY Thou art a soldier only Speak no more ENOBARBUS That truth should be silent I had almost forgot ANTONY You wrong this presence therefore speak no more ENOBARBUS Go to then Your considerate stone CAESAR I do not much dislike the matter but The manner of

Clifford slain And after many scorns many foul taunts They took his head and on the gates of York They set the same and there it doth remain The saddest spectacle that eer I viewed EDWARD Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay O Clifford boisterous Clifford thou hast slain The flower of Europe for his chivalry And treacherously hast thou vanquished him For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee Now my souls palace is become a prison Ah would she break from hence that this my body Might in the ground be closed up in rest For never henceforth shall I joy again Never O never shall I see more joy RICHARD I cannot weep for all my bodys moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart Nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen For selfsame wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast And burns me up with flames that tears would quench To weep is to make less the depth of grief Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me Richard I bear thy name Ill venge thy death Or die renowned by attempting it EDWARD His name that valiant duke hath left with thee His dukedom and his chair with me is

poniards in our flesh till all were told The words would add more anguish than the wounds O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain EDWARD O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet Which held thee dearly as his souls redemption Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death WARWICK Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears And now to add more measure to your woes I come to tell you things sith then befalln After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run Were brought me of your loss and his depart I then in London keeper of the King Mustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends And very well appointed as I thought Marched toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen Bearing the King in my behalf along For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in Parliament Touching King Henrys oath and your succession Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met Our battles joined and both sides fiercely foughtBut whether twas the coldness of the King Who looked full gently on his warlike Queen That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen Or whether twas report of her success Or more than common fear of Cliffords rigour Who thunders to his captives blood and death I cannot judge but to conclude with truth Their weapons like to lightning came and went Our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight Or like an idle thresher with a flail Fell gently down as if they struck their friends I cheered them up with justice of our cause With promise of high pay and great rewards But all in vain they had no heart to fight And we in them no hope to win the day So that we fled the King unto the Queen Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself In haste posthaste are come to join

Lancaster Their power I think is thirty thousand strong Now if the help of Norfolk and myself With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure Will but

gracious liege this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside To whom do lions cast their gentle looks Not to the beast that would usurp their den Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick Not his that spoils her young before her face Who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting Not he that sets his foot upon her back The smallest worm will turn being trodden on And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood Ambitious York did level at thy crown Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows He but a duke would have his son a king And raise his issue like a loving sire Thou being a king blest with a goodly son Didst yield consent to disinherit him Which argued thee a most unloving father Unreasonable creatures feed their young And though mans face be fearful to their eyes Yet in protection of their tender ones Who hath not seen them even with those wings Which sometime they have used with fearful flight Make war with him that climbed unto their nest Offering their own lives in their youngs defence For shame my liege make them your precedent Were it not pity that this goodly boy Should lose his birthright by his fathers fault And long hereafter say unto his child What my greatgrandfather and grandsire got My careless father fondly gave away Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy And let his manly face which promiseth Successful fortune steel thy melting heart To hold thine own and leave thine own with him KING HENRY Full well hath Clifford played the orator Inferring arguments of mighty force But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear That things ill got had ever bad success And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell Ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind And would my father had left me no more For all the rest is held at such a rate As brings a thousandfold more care to keep Than in possession any jot of pleasure Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know How it doth grieve me that thy head is here QUEEN

when his oath is broke for as I hear You that are king though he do wear the crown Have caused him by new act of Parliament To blot out me and put his own son in CLIFFORD And reason too Who should succeed the father but the son RICHARD Are you there butcher O I cannot speak CLIFFORD Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee Or any he the proudest of thy sort RICHARD Twas you that killed young Rutland was it not CLIFFORD Ay and old York and yet not satisfied RICHARD For Gods sake lords give signal to the fight WARWICK What sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crown QUEEN MARGARET Why how now longtongued Warwick dare you speak When you and I met at Saint Albans last Your legs did better service than your hands WARWICK Then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine CLIFFORD You said so much before and yet you fled WARWICK Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence NORTHUMBERLAND No nor your manhood that durst make you stay RICHARD Northumberland I hold thee reverently Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain The execution of my bigswoln heart Upon that Clifford that cruel childkiller CLIFFORD I slew thy father callst thou him a child RICHARD Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland But ere sunset Ill make thee curse the deed KING HENRY Have done with words my lords and hear me speak QUEEN MARGARET Defy them then or else hold close thy lips KING HENRY I prithee give no limits to my tongue I am a king and privileged to speak CLIFFORD My liege the wound that bred this meeting here Cannot be cured by words therefore

broke their fasts today That neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown WARWICK If thou deny their blood upon thy head For York in justice puts his armour on PRINCE EDWARD If that be right which Warwick says is right There is no wrong but everything is right RICHARD Whoever got thee there thy mother stands For well I wot thou hast thy mothers tongue QUEEN MARGARET But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam But like a foul misshapen stigmatic Marked by the Destinies to be avoided As venom toads or lizards dreadful stings RICHARD Iron of Naples hid with English gilt Whose father bears the title of a kingAs if a channel should be called the sea Shamst thou not knowing whence thou art extraught To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart EDWARD A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns To make this shameless callet know herself Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou Although thy husband may be Menelaus And neer was Agamemnons brother wronged By that false woman as this king by thee His father revelled in the heart of France And tamed the King and made the Dauphin stoop And had he matched according to his state He might have kept that glory to this day But when he took a beggar to his bed And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him That washed his fathers fortunes forth of France And heaped sedition on his crown at home For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept And we in pity of the gentle king Had slipped our claim until another age GEORGE But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring And that thy summer bred us no increase We set the axe to thy usurping root And though the edge hath something hit ourselves Yet know thou since we have begun to strike Well never leave till we have hewn thee down Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods EDWARD And in this resolution I defy thee Not willing any longer conference Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak Sound trumpets Let our bloody colours wave And either victory or else a grave QUEEN MARGARET Stay Edward EDWARD No wrangling woman well no longer stay These words will cost ten thousand lives this day Exeunt SCENE III A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in Yorkshire Alarums Excursions Enter Warwick WARWICK Forspent with toil as runners with a race I lay me down a little while to breathe For strokes received and many blows repaid Have robbed my strongknit sinews of their strength And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile Enter Edward running EDWARD Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death For this world frowns and Edwards sun is clouded WARWICK How now my lord what hap What hope of good Enter George GEORGE Our hap is loss our hope but sad despair Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us What counsel give you Whither shall we fly EDWARD Bootless is flight they follow us with wings And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit Enter Richard RICHARD Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself Thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk Broached with the steely point of Cliffords lance And in the very pangs of death he cried Like to a dismal clangor heard from far Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death So underneath the belly of their steeds That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood The noble gentleman gave up the ghost WARWICK Then let the earth be drunken with our blood Ill kill my horse because I will not fly Why stand we like softhearted women here Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage And look upon as if the tragedy Were played in jest by counterfeiting actors Here on my knee I vow to God above Ill never pause again never stand still Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine Or Fortune given me measure of revenge EDWARD O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine And in this vow do chain my soul to thine And ere my knee rise from the earths cold face I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee Thou setter up and plucker down of kings Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands That to my foes this body must be prey Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope And give sweet passage to my sinful soul Now lords take leave until we meet again Whereer it be in heaven or in earth RICHARD Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick Let me embrace thee in my weary arms I that did never weep now melt with woe That winter should cut off our springtime so WARWICK Away away Once more sweet lords farewell GEORGE Yet let us all together to our troops And give them leave to fly that will not stay And call

Warwick comes Clifford flies RICHARD Nay Warwick single out some other chase For I myself will hunt this wolf to death Exeunt SCENE V Another Part of the Field Enter King Henry KING HENRY This battle fares like to the mornings war When dying clouds contend with growing light What time the shepherd blowing of his nails Can neither call it perfect day nor night Now sways it this way like a mighty sea Forced by the tide to combat with the wind Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea Forced to retire by fury of the wind Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind Now one the better then another best Both tugging to be victors breast to breast Yet neither conqueror nor conquered So is the equal poise of this fell war Here on this molehill will I sit me down To whom God will there be the victory For Margaret my queen and Clifford too Have chid me from the battle swearing both They prosper best of all when I am thence Would I were dead if Gods good will were so For what is in this world but grief and woe O God Methinks it were a happy life To be no better than a homely swain To sit upon a hill as I do now To carve out dials quaintly point by point Thereby to see the minutes how they run How many make the hour full complete How many hours brings about the day How many days will finish up the year How many years a mortal man may live When this is known then to divide the times So many hours must I tend my flock So many hours must I take my rest So many hours must I contemplate So many hours must I sport myself So many days my ewes have been with young So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean So many years ere I shall shear the fleece So minutes hours days months and years Passed over to the end they were created Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave Ah what a life were this How sweet how lovely Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep Than doth a rich embroidered canopy To kings that fear their subjects treachery O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth And to conclude the shepherds homely curds His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle His wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade All which secure and sweetly he enjoys Is far beyond a princes delicates His viands sparkling in a golden cup His body couched in a curious bed When care mistrust and treason waits on him Alarum Enter a Son that hath killed his father bringing in the dead body SON Ill blows the wind that profits nobody This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight May be possessed with some store of crowns And I that haply take them from him now May yet ere night yield both my life and them To some man else as this dead man doth me Whos this O God It is my fathers face Whom in this conflict I unwares have killed O heavy times begetting such events From London by the King was I pressed forth My father being the Earl of Warwicks man Came on the part of York pressed by his master And I who at his hands received my life Have by my hands of life bereaved him Pardon me God I knew not what I did And pardon father for I knew not thee My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks And no more words till they have flowed their fill KING HENRY O piteous spectacle O bloody times Whiles lions war and battle for their dens Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity Weep wretched man Ill aid thee tear for tear And let our hearts and eyes like civil war Be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief Enter a Father who has killed his son with the body in his arms FATHER Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold For I have bought it with an hundred blows But let me see is this our foemans face Ah no no no it is mine only son Ah boy if any life be left in thee Throw up thine eye See see what showers arise Blown with the windy tempest of my heart Upon thy wounds that kill mine eye and heart O pity God this miserable age What stratagems how fell how butcherly Erroneous mutinous and unnatural This deadly quarrel daily doth beget O boy thy father gave thee life too soon And hath bereft thee of thy life too late KING HENRY Woe above woe grief more than common grief O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds O pity pity gentle heaven pity The red rose and the white are on his face The fatal colours of our striving houses The one his purple blood right well resembles The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth Wither one rose and let the other flourish If you contend a thousand lives must wither SON How will my mother for a fathers death Take on with me and neer be satisfied FATHER How will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and neer be satisfied KING HENRY How will the country for these woeful chances Misthink the King and not be satisfied SON Was ever son so rued a fathers death FATHER Was ever father so bemoaned his son KING HENRY Was ever king so grieved for subjects woe Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much SON Ill bear thee hence where I may weep my fill Exit with the body FATHER These arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre For from my heart thine image neer shall go My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell And so obsequious will thy father be Even for the loss of thee having no more As Priam was for all his valiant sons Ill bear thee hence and let them fight that will For I have murdered where I should not kill Exit with the body KING HENRY Sadhearted men much overgone with care Here sits a king more woeful than you are Alarums Excursions Enter Queen Margaret Prince of Wales and ExeterPRINCE

stay but love to go Whither the Queen intends Forward away Exeunt SCENE VI Another Part of the Field A loud alarum Enter Clifford wounded CLIFFORD Here burns my candle out ay here it dies Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow More than my bodys parting with my soul My love and fear glued many friends to thee And now I fall thy tough commixtures melts Impairing Henry strengthening misproud York The common people swarm like summer flies And whither fly the gnats but to the sun And who shines now but Henrys enemies O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent That Phathon should check thy fiery steeds Thy burning car never had scorched the earth And Henry hadst thou swayed as kings should do Or as thy father and his father did Giving no ground unto the house of York They never then had sprung like summer flies I and ten thousand in this luckless realm Had left no mourning widows for our death And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight The foe is merciless and will not pity For at their hands I have deserved no pity The air hath got into my deadly wounds And much effuse of blood doth make me faint Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest I stabbed your fathers bosoms split my breast He faints Alarum and retreat Enter Edward George Richard Montague Warwick and Soldiers EDWARD Now breathe we lords Good fortune bids us pause And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks Some troops pursue the bloodyminded Queen That led calm Henry though he were a king As doth a sail filled with a fretting gust Command an argosy to stem the waves But think you lords that Clifford fled with them WARWICK No tis impossible he should escape For though before his face I speak the words Your brother Richard marked him for the grave And wheresoer he is hes surely dead Clifford groans and dies RICHARD Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave A deadly groan like life and deaths departing EDWARD See who it is and now the battles ended If friend or foe let him be gently used RICHARD Revoke that doom of mercy for tis Clifford Who not contented that he lopped the branch In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth But set his murdering knife unto the root From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring I mean our princely father Duke of York WARWICK From off the gates of York fetch down the head Your fathers head which Clifford placed there Instead whereof let this supply the room Measure for measure must be answered EDWARD Bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house That nothing sung but death to us and ours Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound And his illboding tongue no more shall speak Soldiers bring the body forward WARWICK I think his understanding is bereft Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee Dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life And he nor sees nor hears us what we say RICHARD O would he did and so perhaps he doth Tis but his policy to counterfeit Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our father GEORGE If so thou thinkst vex him with eager words RICHARD Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace EDWARD Clifford repent in bootless penitence WARWICK Clifford devise excuses for thy faults GEORGE While we devise fell tortures for thy faults RICHARD Thou didst love York and I am son to York EDWARD Thou pitiedst Rutland I will pity thee GEORGE Wheres Captain Margaret to fence you now WARWICK They mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wont RICHARD What not an oath Nay then the world goes hard When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath I know by that hes dead and by my soul If this right hand would buy but two hours life That I in all despite might rail at him This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood Stifle the villain whose unstaunched thirst York and young Rutland could not satisfy WARWICK Ay but hes dead Off with the traitors head And rear it in the place your fathers stands And now to London with triumphant march There to be crowned Englands royal king From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen So shalt thou sinew both these lands together And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread The scattered foe that hopes to rise again For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears First will I see the coronation And then to Brittany Ill cross the sea To effect this marriage so it please my lord EDWARD Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be For in thy shoulder do I build my seat And never will I undertake the thing Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best

seize upon him KING HENRY Let me embrace thee sour adversity For wise men say it is the wisest course 2 KEEPER Why linger we Let us lay hands upon him 1 KEEPER Forbear awhile well hear a little more KING HENRY My queen and son are gone to France for aid And as I hear the great commanding Warwick Is thither gone to crave the French Kings sister To wife for Edward If this news be true Poor queen and son your labour is but lost For Warwick is a subtle orator And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words By this account then Margaret may win him For shes a woman to be pitied much Her sighs will make a battry in his breast Her tears will pierce into a marble heart The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn And Nero will be tainted with remorse To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears Ay but shes come to beg Warwick to give She on his left side craving aid for Henry He on his right asking a wife for Edward She weeps and says her Henry is deposed He smiles and says his Edward is installed That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong Inferreth arguments of mighty strength And in conclusion wins the King from her With promise of his sister and what else To strengthen and support King Edwards place O Margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul Art then forsaken as thou wentst forlorn 2 KEEPER Say what art thou that talkst of kings and queens KING HENRY More than I seem and less than I was born to A man at least for less I should not be And men may talk of kings and why not I 2 KEEPER Ay but thou talkst as if thou wert a king KING HENRY Why so I am in mind and thats enough 2 KEEPER But if thou be a king where is thy crown KING HENRY My crown is in my heart not on my head Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones Not to be seen My crown is called content A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy 2 KEEPER Well if you be a king crowned with content Your crown content and you must be contented To go along with us for as we think You are the king King Edward hath deposed And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance Will apprehend you as his enemy KING HENRY But did you never swear and break an oath 2 KEEPER No never such an oath nor will not now KING HENRY Where did you dwell when I was King of England 2 KEEPER Here in this country where we now remain KING HENRY I was anointed king at nine months old My father and my grandfather were kings And you were sworn true subjects unto me And tell me then have you not broke your oaths 1 KEEPER No for we were subjects but while you were king KING HENRY Why am I dead Do I not breathe a man Ah simple men you know not what you swear Look as I blow this feather from my face And as the air blows it to me again Obeying with my wind when I do blow And yielding to another when it blows Commanded always by the greater gust Such is the lightness of you common men But do not break your oaths for of that sin My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty Go where you will the King shall be commanded And be you kings command and Ill obey 1 KEEPER We are true subjects to the King King Edward KING HENRY So would you be again to Henry If he were seated as King Edward

defence That Rome can make against them Enter a troop of Citizens MENENIUS Here comes the clusters And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus exile Now hes coming And not a hair upon a soldiers head Which will not prove a whip As many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down And pay you for your

help it now Unless by using means I lame the foot Of our design He bears himself more proudlier Even to my person than I thought he would When first I did embrace him Yet his nature In thats no changeling and I must excuse What cannot be amended LIEUTENANT Yet I wish sir I mean for your particularyou had not Joined in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solely AUFIDIUS I understand thee well and be thou sure When he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state Fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon As draw his sword yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine Wheneer we come to our account LIEUTENANT Sir I beseech you think you hell carry Rome AUFIDIUS All places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his The Senators and Patricians love him too The Tribunes are no soldiers and their people Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty To expel him thence I think hell be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish who takes it By sovereignty of nature First he was A noble servant to them but he could not Carry his honours even Whether twas pride Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From th casque to th cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controlled the war but one of these As he hath spices of them allnot all For I dare so far free himmade him feared So hated and so banished But he has a merit To choke it in the uttrance So our virtues Lie in th interpretation of the time And power unto itself most commendable Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair T extol what it hath done One fire

would not answer to forbade all names He was a kind of nothing titleless Till he had forged himself a name i th fire Of burning Rome MENENIUS Why so you have made good work A pair of tribunes that have wracked Rome To make coals cheap A noble memory COMINIUS I minded him how royal twas to pardon When it was less expected He replied It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punished MENENIUS Very well Could he say less COMINIUS I offered to awaken his regard Fors private friends His answer to me was He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff He said twas folly For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt And still to nose th offence MENENIUS For one poor grain or two I am one of those His mother wife his child And this brave fellow too we are the grains You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon We must be burnt for you SICINIUS Nay pray be patient If you refuse your aid In this soneverneeded help yet do not Upbraids with our distress But sure if you Would be your countrys pleader your good tongue More than the instant army we can make Might stop our countryman MENENIUS No Ill not meddle SICINIUS Pray you go to him MENENIUS What

have stuffed These pipes and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding we have suppler souls Than in our priestlike fasts Therefore Ill watch him Till he be dieted to my request And then Ill set upon him BRUTUS You know the very road into his kindness And cannot lose your way MENENIUS Good faith Ill prove him Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success Exit COMINIUS Hell never hear him SICINIUS Not COMINIUS I tell you he does sit in gold his eye Red as twould burn Rome and his injury The jailer to his pity I kneeled before him Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissed me Thus with his speechless hand What he would do He sent in writing after me what he Would not bound with an oath to yield to his Conditions So that all hope is vain Unless his noble

the gods To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o th air And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak Thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man Still to

his heart LEONATO If you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn To Don John Let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the Prince your brother I owe you all duty DON JOHN I thank you I am not of many words but I thank you LEONATO Please it your Grace lead on DON PEDRO Your hand Leonato we will go together Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio CLAUDIO Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato BENEDICK I noted her not but I looked on her CLAUDIO Is she not a modest young lady BENEDICK Do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex CLAUDIO No I pray thee speak in sober judgment BENEDICK Why i faith methinks shes too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like her CLAUDIO Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her BENEDICK Would you buy her that you enquire after her CLAUDIO Can the world buy such a jewel BENEDICK Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a good harefinder and Vulcan a rare carpenter Come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song CLAUDIO In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on BENEDICK I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter theres her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December But I hope you have no intent to turn husband have you CLAUDIO I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn to the contrary if Hero would be my wife BENEDICK Ist come to this in faith Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again Go to i faith and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays Reenter Don Pedro Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you DON PEDRO What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonatos BENEDICK I would your Grace would constrain me to tell DON PEDRO I charge thee on thy allegiance BENEDICK You hear Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love With who now that is your Graces part Mark how short his answer is with Hero Leonatos short daughter CLAUDIO If this were so so were it uttered BENEDICK Like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed God forbid it should be so CLAUDIO If my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be otherwise DON PEDRO Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy CLAUDIO You speak this to fetch me in my lord DON PEDRO By my troth I speak my thought CLAUDIO And in faith my lord I spoke mine BENEDICK And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine CLAUDIO That I love her I feel DON PEDRO That she is worthy I know BENEDICK That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake DON PEDRO Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty CLAUDIO And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will BENEDICK That a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me up I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the right to trust none and the fine isfor the which I may go the finerI will live a bachelor DON PEDRO I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love BENEDICK With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a balladmakers pen and hang me up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of blind Cupid DON PEDRO Well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument BENEDICK If I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam DON PEDRO Well as time shall try In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke BENEDICK The savage bull may but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write Here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign Here you may see Benedick the married man CLAUDIO If this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad DON PEDRO Nay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice thou wilt quake for this shortly BENEDICK I look for an earthquake too then DON PEDRO Well you will temporize with the hours In the meantime good Signior Benedick repair to Leonatos commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation BENEDICK I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so I commit you CLAUDIO To the tuition of God from my house if I had it DON PEDRO The sixth of July your loving friend Benedick BENEDICK Nay mock not mock not The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so I leave you Exit CLAUDIO My liege your Highness now may do me good DON PEDRO My love is thine to teach teach it but how And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good CLAUDIO Hath Leonato any son my lord DON PEDRO No child but Hero shes his only heir Dost thou affect her Claudio CLAUDIO O my lord When you went onward on this ended action I looked upon her with a soldiers eye That likd but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love But now I am returnd and that warthoughts Have left their places vacant in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires All prompting me how fair young Hero is Saying I likd her ere I went to wars DON PEDRO Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it And I will break with her and with her father And thou shalt have her Wast not to this end That thou beganst to twist so fine a story CLAUDIO How sweetly you do minister to love That know loves grief by his complexion But lest my liking might too sudden seem I would have salvd it with a longer treatise DON PEDRO What need the bridge much broader than the flood The fairest grant is the necessity Look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovst And I will fit thee with the remedy I know we shall have revelling tonight I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio And in her bosom Ill unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale Then after to her father will I break And the conclusion is she shall be thine In practice let us put it presently Exeunt SCENE II A room in Leonatos house Enter Leonato and Antonio meeting LEONATO How now brother Where is my cousin your son Hath he provided this music ANTONIO He is very busy about it But brother I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of LEONATO Are they good ANTONIO As the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward The Prince and Count Claudio walking in a thickpleached alley in my orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it LEONATO Hath the fellow any wit that told you this ANTONIO A good sharp fellow I will send for him and question him yourself LEONATO No no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true Go you and tell her of it Several persons cross the stage Cousins you know what you have to do O I cry you mercy friend go you with me and I will use your skill Good cousin have a care this busy time Exeunt SCENE III Another room in Leonatos house Enter Don John and Conrade CONRADE What the goodyear my lord why are you thus out of measure sad DON JOHN There is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit CONRADE You should hear reason DON JOHN And when I have heard it what blessings brings it CONRADE If not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance DON JOHN I wonder that thou being as thou sayst thou art born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no mans jests eat when I have stomach and wait for no mans leisure sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no mans business laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humour CONRADE Yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment You have of late stood out against your brother and he hath taen you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvestDON JOHN I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but I am a plaindealing villain I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage If I had my mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I would do my liking in the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me CONRADE Can you make no use of your discontent DON JOHN I make all use of it for I use it only Who comes here Enter Borachio What news Borachio BORACHIO I came yonder from a great supper the Prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage DON JOHN Will it serve for any model to build mischief on What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness BORACHIO Marry it is your brothers right hand DON JOHN Who the most exquisite Claudio BORACHIO Even he DON JOHN A proper squire And who and who which way looks he BORACHIO Marry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato DON JOHN A very forward Marchchick How came you to this BORACHIO Being entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a musty room comes me the Prince and Claudio hand in hand in sad conference I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself and having obtained her give her to Count Claudio DON JOHN Come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure That young startup hath all the glory of my overthrow if I can cross him any way I bless myself every way You are both sure and will assist me CONRADE To the death my lord DON JOHN Let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that I am subdued Would the cook were of my mind Shall we go to prove whats to be done BORACHIO Well wait upon your Lordship Exeunt ACT II SCENE I A hall in Leonatos house Enter Leonato Antonio Hero Beatrice and others LEONATO Was not Count John here at supper ANTONIO I saw him not BEATRICE How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after HERO He is of a very melancholy disposition BEATRICE He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling LEONATO Then half Signior Benedicks tongue in Count Johns mouth and half Count Johns melancholy in Signior Benedicks face BEATRICE With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her good will LEONATO By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue ANTONIO In faith shes too curst BEATRICE Too curst is more than curst I shall lessen Gods sending that way for it is said God sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none LEONATO So by being too curst God will send you no horns BEATRICE Just if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening Lord I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in the woollen LEONATO You may light on a husband that hath no beard BEATRICE What should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man I am not for him therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his apes into hell LEONATO Well then go you into hell BEATRICE No but to the gate and there will the Devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say Get you to heaven Beatrice get you to heaven heres no place for you maids So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long ANTONIO To Hero Well niece I trust you will be ruled by your father BEATRICE Yes faith it is my cousins duty to make curtsy and say Father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say Father as it please me LEONATO Well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband BEATRICE Not till God make men of some other metal than earth Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl No uncle Ill none Adams sons are my brethren and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred LEONATO Daughter remember what I told you if the Prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer BEATRICE The fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the Prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer For hear me Hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave LEONATO Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly BEATRICE I have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylight LEONATO The revellers are entering brother make good room Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick Balthasar Don John Borachio Margaret Ursula and Others masked DON PEDRO Lady will you walk about with your friend HERO So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away DON PEDRO With me in your company HERO I may say so when I please DON PEDRO And when please you to say so HERO When I like your favour for God defend the lute should be like the case DON PEDRO My visor is Philemons roof within the house is Jove HERO Why then your visor should be thatchd DON PEDRO Speak low if you speak love Takes her aside BALTHASAR Well I would you did like me MARGARET So would not I for your own sake for I have many ill qualities BALTHASAR Which is one MARGARET I say my prayers aloud BALTHASAR I love you the better the hearers may cry Amen MARGARET God match me with a good dancer BALTHASAR Amen MARGARET And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done Answer clerk BALTHASAR No more words the clerk is answered URSULA I know you well enough you are Signior Antonio ANTONIO At a word I am not URSULA I know you by the waggling of your head ANTONIO To tell you true I counterfeit him URSULA You could never do him so illwell unless you were the very man Heres his dry hand up and down you are he you are he ANTONIO At a word I am not URSULA Come come do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit Can virtue hide itself Go to mum you are he graces will appear and theres an end BEATRICE Will you not tell me who told you so BENEDICK No you shall pardon me BEATRICE Nor will you not tell me who you are BENEDICK Not now BEATRICE That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of the Hundred Merry Tales Well this was Signior Benedick that said so BENEDICK Whats he BEATRICE I am sure you know him well enough BENEDICK Not I believe me BEATRICE Did he never make you laugh BENEDICK I pray you what is he BEATRICE Why he is the Princes jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet I would he had boarded me BENEDICK When I know the gentleman Ill tell him what you say BEATRICE Do do hell but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then theres a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night Music within We must follow the leaders BENEDICK In every good thing BEATRICE Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next turning Dance Then exeunt all but Don John Borachio and Claudio DON JOHN Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it The ladies follow her and but one visor remains BORACHIO And that is Claudio I know him by his bearing DON JOHN Are you not Signior Benedick CLAUDIO You know me well I am he DON JOHN Signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on Hero I pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it CLAUDIO How know you he loves her DON JOHN I heard him swear his affection BORACHIO So did I too and he swore he would marry her tonight DON JOHN Come let us to the banquet Exeunt Don John and Borachio CLAUDIO Thus answer I in name of Benedick But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio Tis certain so the Prince woos for himself Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood This is an accident of hourly proof Which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero Reenter Benedick BENEDICK Count Claudio CLAUDIO Yea the same BENEDICK Come will you go with me CLAUDIO Whither BENEDICK Even to the next willow about your own business Count What fashion will you wear the garland of About your neck like a usurers chain or under your arm like a lieutenants scarf You must wear it one way for the Prince hath got your Hero CLAUDIO I wish him joy of her BENEDICK Why thats spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks But did you think the Prince would have served you thus CLAUDIO I pray you leave me BENEDICK Ho now you strike like the blind man twas the boy that stole your meat and youll beat the post CLAUDIO If it will not be Ill leave you Exit BENEDICK Alas poor hurt fowl Now will he creep into sedges But that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not know me The Princes fool Ha it may be I go under that title because I am merry Yea but so I am apt to do myself wrong I am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out Well Ill be revenged as I mayReenter Don Pedro DON PEDRO Now signior wheres the Count Did you see him BENEDICK Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him and I think I told him true that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady and I offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped DON PEDRO To be whipped Whats his fault BENEDICK The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyd with finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals it DON PEDRO Wilt thou make a trust a transgression The transgression is in the stealer BENEDICK Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as I take it have stolen his birds nest DON PEDRO I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner BENEDICK If their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly DON PEDRO The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you BENEDICK O she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her She told me not thinking I had been myself that I was the Princes jester that I was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me She speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made Hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too Come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follow her Reenter Claudio Beatrice Hero and Leonato DON PEDRO Look here she comes BENEDICK Will your Grace command me any service to the worlds end I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia bring you the length of Prester Johns foot fetch you a hair off the Great Chams beard do you any embassage to the Pygmies rather than hold three words conference with this harpy You have no employment for me DON PEDRO None but to desire your good company BENEDICK O God sir heres a dish I love not I cannot endure my Lady Tongue Exit DON PEDRO Come lady come you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick BEATRICE Indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and I gave him use for it a double heart for a single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it DON PEDRO You have put him down lady you have put him down BEATRICE So I would not he should do me my lord lest I should prove the mother of fools I have brought Count Claudio whom you sent me to seek DON PEDRO Why how now Count wherefore are you sad CLAUDIO Not sad my lord DON PEDRO How then Sick CLAUDIO Neither my lord BEATRICE The Count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil Count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion DON PEDRO I faith lady I think your blazon to be true though Ill be sworn if he be so his conceit is false Here Claudio I have wooed in thy name and fair Hero is won I have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and God give thee joy LEONATO Count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his Grace hath made the match and all grace say Amen to it BEATRICE Speak Count tis your cue CLAUDIO Silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little happy if I could say how much Lady as you are mine I am yours I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange BEATRICE Speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither DON PEDRO In faith lady you have a merry heart BEATRICE Yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart CLAUDIO And so she doth cousin BEATRICE Good Lord for alliance Thus goes everyone to the world but I and I am sunburnt I may sit in a corner and cry heighho for a husband DON PEDRO Lady Beatrice I will get you one BEATRICE I would rather have one of your fathers getting Hath your Grace neer a brother like you Your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them DON PEDRO Will you have me lady BEATRICE No my lord unless I might have another for working days your Grace is too costly to wear every day But I beseech your Grace pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matter DON PEDRO Your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour BEATRICE No sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was I born Cousins God give you joy LEONATO Niece will you look to those things I told you of BEATRICE I cry you mercy uncle By your Graces pardon Exit DON PEDRO By my troth a pleasant spirited lady LEONATO Theres little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing DON PEDRO She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband LEONATO O by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit DON PEDRO She were an excellent wife for Benedick LEONATO O Lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad DON PEDRO Count Claudio when mean you to go to church CLAUDIO Tomorrow my lord Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites LEONATO Not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind DON PEDRO Come you shake the head at so long a breathing but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go dully by us I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules labours which is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other I would fain have it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction LEONATO My lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings CLAUDIO And I my lord DON PEDRO And you too gentle Hero HERO I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband DON PEDRO And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty I will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I with your two helps will so practise on Benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only lovegods Go in with me and I will tell you my drift Exeunt SCENE II Another room in Leonatos house Enter Don John and Borachio DON JOHN It is so the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato BORACHIO Yea my lord but I can cross it DON JOHN Any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine How canst thou cross this marriage BORACHIO Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me DON JOHN Show me briefly how BORACHIO I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero DON JOHN I remember BORACHIO I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber window DON JOHN What life is in that to be the death of this marriage BORACHIO The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the Prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold upto a contaminated stale such a one as Hero DON JOHN What proof shall I make of that BORACHIO Proof enough to misuse the Prince to vex Claudio to undo Hero and kill Leonato Look you for any other issue DON JOHN Only to despite them I will endeavour anything BORACHIO Go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio asin love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maidthat you have discovered thus They will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of Heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown DON JOHN Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats BORACHIO Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me DON JOHN I will presently go learn their day of marriage Exeunt SCENE III Leonatos Garden Enter Benedick BENEDICK Boy Enter a Boy BOY Signior BENEDICK In my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard BOY I am here already sir BENEDICK I know that but I would have thee hence and here again Exit Boy I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot"

Vicar A person representing HYMEN Lords belonging to the two Dukes Pages Foresters and other Attendants The scene lies first near Olivers house afterwards partly in the Usurpers court and partly in the Forest of Arden ACT I SCENE I An Orchard near Olivers house Enter Orlando and Adam ORLANDO As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayst charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit For my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid itEnter Oliver ADAM Yonder comes my master your brother ORLANDO Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up Adam retires OLIVER Now sir what make you here ORLANDO Nothing I am not taught to make anything OLIVER What mar you then sir ORLANDO Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness OLIVER Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile ORLANDO Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury OLIVER Know you where you are sir ORLANDO O sir very well here in your orchard OLIVER Know you before whom sir ORLANDO Ay better than him I am before knows me I know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the firstborn but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence OLIVER What boy ORLANDO Come come elder brother you are too young in this OLIVER Wilt thou lay hands on me villain ORLANDO I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so Thou has railed on thyself ADAM Coming forward Sweet masters be patient For your fathers remembrance be at accord OLIVER Let me go I say ORLANDO I will not till I please You shall hear me My father charged you in his will to give me good education You have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy my fortunes OLIVER And what wilt thou do Beg when that is spent Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled with you You shall have some part of your will I pray you leave me ORLANDO I no further offend you than becomes me for my good OLIVER Get you with him you old dog ADAM Is old dog my reward

rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla Dennis Enter Dennis DENNIS Calls your worship OLIVER Was not Charles the Dukes wrestler here to speak with me DENNIS So please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you OLIVER Call him in Exit Dennis Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is Enter Charles CHARLES Good morrow to your worship OLIVER Good Monsieur Charles Whats the new news at the new court CHARLES Theres no news at the court sir but the old news That is the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander OLIVER Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter be banished with her father CHARLES O no for the Dukes daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do OLIVER Where will the old Duke live CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world OLIVER What you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in Therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will OLIVER Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other For I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come tomorrow Ill give him his payment If ever he go alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more And so God keep your worship Exit OLIVER Farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an end of him for my soulyet I know not whyhates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that I am altogether misprized But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about Exit SCENE II A Lawn before the Dukes Palace Enter Rosalind and Celia CELIA I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry ROSALIND Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure CELIA Herein I see thou lovst me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine So wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee ROSALIND Well I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours CELIA You know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection By mine honour I will And when I break that oath let me turn monster Therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry ROSALIND From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let me seewhat think you of falling in love CELIA Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again ROSALIND What shall be our sport then CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally ROSALIND I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women CELIA Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very illfavouredly ROSALIND Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of Nature Enter Touchstone CELIA No When Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ROSALIND Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of Natures wit CELIA Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the witsHow now wit whither wander you TOUCHSTONE Mistress you must come away to your father CELIA Were you made the messenger TOUCHSTONE No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you ROSALIND Where learned you that oath fool TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught Now Ill stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn CELIA How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ROSALIND Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom TOUCHSTONE Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave CELIA By our beards if we had them thou art TOUCHSTONE By my knavery if I had it then I were But if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn No more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard CELIA Prithee who ist that thou meanst TOUCHSTONE One that old Frederick your father loves CELIA My fathers love is enough to honour him Enough Speak no more of him Youll be whipped for taxation one of these days TOUCHSTONE The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly CELIA By my troth thou sayest true For since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le BeauEnter Le Beau ROSALIND With his mouth full of news CELIA Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young ROSALIND Then shall we be newscrammed CELIA All the better we shall be the more marketable Bonjour Monsieur Le Beau Whats the news LE BEAU Fair princess you have lost much good sport CELIA Sport Of what colour LE BEAU What colour madam How shall I answer you ROSALIND As wit and fortune will TOUCHSTONE Or as the destinies decrees CELIA Well said That was laid on with a trowel TOUCHSTONE Nay if I keep not my rank ROSALIND Thou losest thy old smell LE BEAU You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of ROSALIND Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling LE BEAU I will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it CELIA Well the beginning that is dead and buried LE BEAU There comes an old man and his three sons CELIA I could match this beginning with an old tale LE BEAU Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence ROSALIND With bills on their necks Be it known unto all men by these presents LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the Dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him So he served the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping ROSALIND Alas TOUCHSTONE But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost LE BEAU Why this that I speak of TOUCHSTONE Thus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies CELIA Or I I promise thee ROSALIND But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon ribbreaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin LE BEAU You must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it CELIA Yonder sure they are coming Let us now stay and see it Flourish Enter Duke Frederick Lords Orlando Charles and Attendants DUKE FREDERICK Come on Since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness ROSALIND Is yonder the man LE BEAU Even he madam CELIA Alas he is too young Yet he looks successfully DUKE FREDERICK How now daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to see the wrestling ROSALIND Ay my liege so please you give us leave DUKE FREDERICK You will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man In pity of the challengers youth I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if you can move him CELIA Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau DUKE FREDERICK Do so Ill not be by Duke Frederick steps aside LE BEAU Monsieur the challenger the Princess calls for you ORLANDO I attend them with all respect and duty ROSALIND Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler ORLANDO No fair princess He is the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth CELIA Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years You have seen cruel proof of this mans strength If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt ROSALIND Do young sir Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward ORLANDO I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty ROSALIND The little strength that I have I would it were with you CELIA And mine to eke out hers ROSALIND Fare you well Pray heaven I be deceived in you CELIA Your hearts desires be with you CHARLES Come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ORLANDO Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working DUKE FREDERICK You shall try but one fall CHARLES No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first ORLANDO You mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before But come your ways ROSALIND Now Hercules be thy speed young man CELIA I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg Orlando and Charles wrestle ROSALIND O excellent young man CELIA If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down Charles is thrown Shout DUKE FREDERICK No more no more ORLANDO Yes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathed DUKE FREDERICK How dost thou Charles LE BEAU He cannot speak my lord DUKE FREDERICK Bear him away Charles is carried off by Attendants What is thy name young man ORLANDO Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys DUKE FREDERICK I would thou hadst been son to some man else The world esteemed thy father honourable But I did find him still mine enemy Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth I would thou hadst told me of another father Exeunt Duke Frederick Le Beau and Lords CELIA Were I my father coz would I do this ORLANDO I am more proud to be Sir Rowlands son His youngest son and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick ROSALIND My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul And all the world was of my fathers mind Had I before known this young man his son I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured CELIA Gentle cousin Let us go thank him and encourage him My fathers rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heartSir you have well deserved If you do keep your promises in love But justly as you have exceeded promise Your mistress shall be happy ROSALIND Gentleman Giving him a chain from her neck Wear this for meone out of suits with Fortune That could give more but that her hand lacks means Shall we go coz CELIA AyFare you well fair gentleman ORLANDO Can I not say I thank you My better parts Are all thrown down and that which here stands up Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block ROSALIND He calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes Ill ask him what he wouldDid you call sir Sir you have wrestled well and

Aaron ACT II SCENE I Rome Before the palace Aaron alone AARON Now climbeth Tamora Olympus top Safe out of Fortunes shot and sits aloft Secure of thunders crack or lightnings flash Advanced above pale envys threatning reach As when the golden sun salutes the morn And having gilt the ocean with his beams Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach And overlooks the highestpeering hills So Tamora Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held fettred in amorous chains And faster bound to Aarons charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold To wait upon this newmade empress To wait said I To wanton with this queen This goddess this Semiramis this nymph This siren that will charm Romes Saturnine And see his shipwrack and his commonweals Holla What storm is this Enter Chiron and Demetrius braving DEMETRIUS Chiron thy years wants wit thy wit wants edge And manners to intrude where I am graced And may for aught thou knowest affected be CHIRON Demetrius thou dost overween in all And so in this to bear me down with braves Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate I am as able and as fit as thou To serve and to deserve my mistress grace And that my sword upon thee shall approve And plead my passions for Lavinias love AARON Aside Clubs clubs These lovers will not keep the peace DEMETRIUS Why boy although our mother unadvised Gave you a dancingrapier by your side Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends Go to have your lath glued within your sheathTill you know better how to handle it CHIRON Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare DEMETRIUS Ay boy grow ye so brave They draw AARON Why how now lords So near the emperors palace dare ye draw And maintain such a quarrel openly Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome For shame put up DEMETRIUS Not I till I have sheathed My rapier in his bosom and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breathed in my dishonour here CHIRON For that I am prepared and full resolved Foulspoken coward that thundrest with thy tongue And with thy weapon nothing darst perform AARON Away I say Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore This pretty brabble will undo us all Why lords and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a princes right What is Lavinia then become so loose Or Bassianus so degenerate That for her love such quarrels may be broached Without controlment justice or revenge Young lords beware And should the empress know This discords ground the music would not please CHIRON I care not I knew she and all the world I love Lavinia more than all the world DEMETRIUS Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice Lavina is thine elder brothers hope AARON Why are ye mad Or know ye not in Rome How furious and impatient they be And cannot brook competitors in love I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths By this device CHIRON Aaron a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I love AARON To achieve her How DEMETRIUS Why makes thou it so strange She is a woman therefore may be wooed She is a woman therefore may be won She is Lavinia therefore must be loved What man more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know Though Bassianus be the emperors brother Better than he have worn Vulcans badge AARON Aside Ay and as good as Saturninus may DEMETRIUS Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words fair looks and liberality What hast not thou full often struck a doe And borne her cleanly by the keepers nose AARON Why then it seems some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns CHIRON Ay so the turn were served DEMETRIUS Aaron thou hast hit it AARON Would you had hit it too Then should not we be tired with this ado Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools To square for this Would it offend you then That both should speed CHIRON Faith not me DEMETRIUS Nor me so I were one AARON For shame be friends and join for that you jar Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect and so must you resolve That what you cannot as you would achieve You must perforce accomplish as you may Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia Bassianus love A speedier course than lingring languishment Must we pursue and I have found the path My lords a solemn hunting is in hand There will the lovely Roman ladies troop The forest walks are wide and spacious And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villainy Single you thither then this dainty doe And strike her home by force if not by words This way or not at all stand you in hope Come come our empress with her sacred wit To villainy and vengeance consecrate Will we acquaint with all what we intend And she shall file our engines with advice That will not suffer you to square yourselves But to your wishes height advance you both The emperors court is like the house of Fame The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull There speak and strike brave boys and take your turns There serve your lust shadowed from heavens eye And revel in Lavinias treasury CHIRON Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice DEMETRIUS Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits Per Stygia per manes vehor Exeunt SCENE II A Forest near Rome a Lodge seen at a distance Horns and cry of hounds heard Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sons and Marcus making a noise with hounds and horns TITUS The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey The fields are fragrant and the woods are green Uncouple here and let us make a bay And wake the emperor and his lovely bride And rouse the prince and ring a hunters peal That all the court may echo with the noise Sons let it be your charge as it is ours To attend the emperors person carefully I have been troubled in my sleep this night But dawning day new comfort hath inspired Here a cry of hounds and wind horns in a peal Then enter Saturninus Tamora Bassianus Lavinia Chiron Demetrius and their Attendants Many good morrows to your majesty Madam to you as many and as good I promised your grace a hunters peal SATURNINUS And you have rung it lustily my lords Somewhat too early for newmarried ladies BASSIANUS Lavinia how say you LAVINIA I say no I have been broad awake two hours and more SATURNINUS Come on then horse and chariots let us have And to our sport To Tamora Madam now shall ye see Our Roman hunting MARCUS I have dogs my lord Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase And climb the highest promontory top TITUS And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way and run like swallows oer the plain DEMETRIUS Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground Exeunt SCENE III A lonely part of the Forest Enter Aaron alone carrying a bag of gold AARON He that had wit would think that I had none To bury so much gold under a tree And never after to inherit it Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem Which cunningly effected will beget A very excellent piece of villainy And so repose sweet gold for their unrest That have their alms out of the empress chest He hides the bag Enter Tamora alone to the Moor TAMORA My lovely Aaron wherefore lookst thou sad When everything doth make a gleeful boast The birds chant melody on every bush The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind And make a chequered shadow on the ground Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds Replying shrilly to the welltuned horns As if a double hunt were heard at once Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise And after conflict such as was supposed The wandring prince and Dido once enjoyed When with a happy storm they were surprised And curtained with a counselkeeping cave We may each wreathed in the others arms Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurses song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep AARON Madam though Venus govern your desires Saturn is dominator over mine What signifies my deadlystanding eye My silence and my cloudy melancholy My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution No madam these are no venereal signs Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand Blood and revenge are hammering in my head Hark Tamora the empress of my soul Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee This is the day of doom for Bassianus His Philomel must lose her tongue today Thy sons make pillage of her chastity And wash their hands in Bassianus blood Seest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee And give the king this fatalplotted scroll Now question me no more we are espied Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty Which dreads not yet their lives destruction Enter Bassianus and Lavinia TAMORA Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life AARON No more great empress Bassianus comes Be cross with him and Ill go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels whatsoeer they be Exit BASSIANUS Who have we here Romes royal empress Unfurnished of her wellbeseeming troop Or is it Dian habited like her Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest TAMORA Saucy controller of my private steps Had I the power that some say Dian had Thy temples should be planted presently With horns as was Actaeons and the hounds Should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs Unmannerly intruder as thou art LAVINIA Under your patience gentle empress Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try experiments Jove shield your husband from his hounds today Tis pity they should take him for a stag BASSIANUS Believe me queen your swarthy Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his bodys hue Spotted detested and abominable Why are you sequestered from all your train Dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed And wandered hither to an obscure plot Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor If foul desire had not conducted you LAVINIA And being intercepted in your sport Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness I pray you let us hence And let her joy her ravencoloured love This valley fits the purpose passing well BASSIANUS The king my brother shall have notice of this LAVINIA Ay for these slips have made him noted long Good king to be so mightily abused TAMORA Why I have patience to endure all this Enter Chiron and Demetrius DEMETRIUS How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother Why doth your highness look so pale and wan TAMORA Have I not reason think you to look pale These two have ticed me hither to this place A barren detested vale you see it is The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven And when they showed me this abhorred pit They told me here at dead time of the night A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins Would make such fearful and confused cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly No sooner had they told this hellish tale But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew And leave me to this miserable death And then they called me foul adulteress Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect And had you not by wondrous fortune come This vengeance on me had they executedRevenge it as you love your mothers life Or be ye not henceforth called my children DEMETRIUS This is a witness that I am thy son Stabs Bassianus CHIRON And this for me struck home to show my strength Also stabs Bassianus who dies LAVINIA Ay come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora For no name fits thy nature but thy own TAMORA Give me thy poniard you shall know my boys Your mothers hand shall right your mothers wrong DEMETRIUS Stay madam here is more belongs to her First thrash the corn then after burn the straw This minion stood upon her chastity Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty And with that painted hope braves your mightiness And shall she carry this unto her grave CHIRON And if she do I would I were an eunuch Drag hence her husband to some secret hole And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust TAMORA But when ye have the honey ye desire Let not this wasp outlive us both to sting CHIRON I warrant you madam we will make that sure Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy That nicepreserved honesty of yours LAVINIA O Tamora thou bearest a womans face TAMORA I will not hear her speak away with her LAVINIA Sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word DEMETRIUS Listen fair madam let it be your glory To see her tears but be your heart to them As unrelenting flint to drops of rain LAVINIA When did the tigers young ones teach the dam O do not learn her wrath she taught it thee The milk thou suckst from her did turn to marble Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny Yet every mother breeds not sons alike To Chiron Do thou entreat her show a womans pity CHIRON What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard LAVINIA Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark Yet have I heardO could I find it now The lion moved with pity did endure To have his princely paws pared all away Some say that ravens foster forlorn children The whilst their own birds famish in their nests O be to me though thy hard heart say no Nothing so kind but something pitiful TAMORA I know not what it means away with her LAVINIA O let me teach thee For my fathers sake That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee Be not obdurate open thy deaf ears TAMORA Hadst thou in person neer offended me Even for his sake am I pitiless Remember boys I poured forth tears in vain To save your brother from the sacrifice But fierce Andronicus would not relent Therefore away with her and use her as you will The worse to her the better loved of me LAVINIA O Tamora be called a gentle queen And with thine own hands kill me in this place For tis not life that I have begged so long Poor I was slain when Bassianus died TAMORA What beggst thou then Fond woman let me go LAVINIA Tis present death I beg and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell O keep me from their worse than killing lust And tumble me into some loathsome pit Where never mans eye may behold my body Do this and be a charitable murderer TAMORA So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee No let them satisfy their lust on thee DEMETRIUS Away for thou hast stayed us here too long LAVINIA No grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature The blot and enemy to our general name Confusion fall CHIRON Nay then Ill stop your mouth Bring thou her husband This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him They put Bassianuss body in the pit and exit carrying off Lavinia TAMORA Farewell my sons See that you make her sure Neer let my heart know merry cheer indeed Till all the Andronici be made away Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower Exit Enter Aaron with two of Titus sons Quintus and Martius AARON Come on my lords the better foot before Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit Where I espied the panther fast asleep QUINTUS My sight is very dull whateer it bodes MARTIUS And mine I promise you Were it not for shame Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile He falls into the pit QUINTUS What art thou fallen What subtle hole is this Whose mouth is covered with rudegrowing briers Upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers A very fatal place it seems to me Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall MARTIUS O brother with the dismallst object hurt That ever eye with sight made heart lament AARON Aside Now will I fetch the king to find them here That he thereby may have a likely guess How these were they that made away his brother Exit MARTIUS Why dost not comfort me and help me out From this unhallowed and bloodstained hole QUINTUS I am surprised with an uncouth fear A chilling sweat oerruns my trembling joints My heart suspects more than mine eye can see MARTIUS To prove thou hast a truedivining heart Aaron and thou look down into this den And see a fearful sight of blood and death QUINTUS Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise O tell me who it is for neer till now Was I a child to fear I know not what MARTIUS Lord Bassianus lies berayed in blood All on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb In this detested dark blooddrinking pit QUINTUS If it be dark how dost thou know tis he MARTIUS Upon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring that lightens all the hole Which like a taper in some monument Doth shine upon the dead mans earthy cheeks And shows the ragged entrails of the pit So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood O brother help me with thy fainting hand If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath Out of this fell devouring receptacle As hateful as Cocytus misty mouth QUINTUS Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out Or wanting strength to do thee so much good I may be plucked into the swallowing womb Of this deep pit poor Bassianus grave I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink MARTIUS Nor I no strength to climb without thy help QUINTUS Thy hand once more I will not loose again Till thou art here aloft or I below Thou canst not come to me I come to thee Falls in Enter the Emperor Saturninus and Aaron the Moor SATURNINUS Along with me Ill see what hole is here And what he is that now is leapt into it Say who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth MARTIUS The unhappy sons of old Andronicus Brought hither in a most unlucky hour To find thy brother Bassianus dead SATURNINUS My brother dead I know thou dost but jest He and his lady both are at the lodge Upon the north side of this pleasant chase Tis not an hour since I left them there MARTIUS We know not where you left them all alive But out alas here have we found him dead Enter Tamora Titus Andronicus and Lucius TAMORA Where is my lord the king SATURNINUS Here Tamora though grieved with killing grief TAMORA Where is thy brother Bassianus SATURNINUS Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound Poor Bassianus here lies murdered TAMORA Then all too late I bring this fatal writ The complot of this timeless tragedy And wonder greatly that mans face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny She giveth Saturnine a letter SATURNINUS Reads An if we miss to meet him handsomely Sweet huntsman Bassianus tis we mean Do thou so much as dig the grave for him Thou knowst our meaning Look for thy reward Among the nettles at the eldertree Which overshades the mouth of that same pit Where we decreed to bury Bassianus Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends O Tamora was ever heard the like This is the pit and this the eldertree Look sirs if you can find the huntsman out That should have murdered Bassianus here AARON My gracious lord here is the bag of gold Showing it SATURNINUS To Titus Two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind Have here bereft my brother of his life Sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison There let them bide until we have devised Some neverheardof torturing pain for them TAMORA What are they in this pit O wondrous thing How easily murder is discovered TITUS High emperor upon my feeble knee I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed That this fell fault of my accursed"

doth publish every where Our love was new and then but in the spring When I was wont to greet it with my lays As Philomel in summers front doth sing And stops her pipe in growth of riper days Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night But that wild music burthens every bough And sweets grown common lose their dear delight Therefore like her I sometime

my added praise beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace Were it not

Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was beautys summer dead105 Let not my love be called idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my songs and praises be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined One thing expressing leaves out difference Fair kind and true is all my argument Fair kind and true varying to other words And in this change is my invention spent Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords Fair kind and true have often lived alone Which three till now never kept seat in one 106 When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they looked but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we which now behold these present days Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 107 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come Can yet the lease of my true love control Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured And the sad augurs mock their own presage Incertainties now crown themselves assured And peace proclaims olives of endless age Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes And thou in this shalt find thy monument When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 108 Whats in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit Whats new to speak what now to register That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine I must each day say oer the very same Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name So that eternal love in loves fresh case Weighs not the dust and injury of age Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place But makes antiquity for aye his page Finding the first conceit of love there bred Where time and outward form would show it dead 109 O never say that I was false of heart Though absence seemed my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that travels I return again Just to the time not with the time exchanged So that my self bring water for my stain Never believe though in my nature reigned All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood That it could so preposterously be stained To leave for nothing all thy sum of good For nothing this wide universe I call Save thou my rose in it thou art my all 110 Alas tis true I have gone here and there And made my self a motley to the view Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear Made old offences of affections new Most true it is that I have looked on truth Askance and strangely but by all above These blenches gave my heart another youth And worse essays proved thee my best of love Now all is done have what shall have no end Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof to try an older friend A god in love to whom I am confined Then give me welcome next my heaven the best Even to thy pure and most most loving breast 111 O for my sake do you with Fortune chide The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds Thence comes it that my name receives a brand And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in like the dyers hand Pity me then and wish I were renewed Whilst like a willing patient I will drink Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection No bitterness that I will bitter think Nor double penance to correct correction Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me 112 Your love and pity doth th impression fill Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow For what care I who calls me well or ill So you oergreen my bad my good allow You are my all the world and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue None else to me nor I to none alive That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others voices that my adders sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are Mark how with my neglect I do dispense You are so strongly in my purpose bred That all the world besides methinks are dead 113 Since I left you mine eye is in my mind And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function and is partly blind Seems seeing but effectually is out For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch Of his quick objects hath the mind no part Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight The most sweet favour or deformedst creature The mountain or the sea the day or night The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature Incapable of more replete with you My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue 114 Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true And that your love taught it this alchemy To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble Creating every bad a perfect best As fast as objects to his beams assemble O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing And my great mind most kingly drinks it up Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing And to his palate doth prepare the cup If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin 115 Those lines that I before have writ do lie Even those that said I could not love you dearer Yet then my judgement knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer But reckoning time whose millioned accidents Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents Divert strong minds to the course of altring things Alas why fearing of times tyranny Might I not then say Now I love you best When I was certain oer incertainty Crowning the present doubting of the rest Love is a babe then might I not say so To give full growth to that which still doth grow 116 Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove O no it is an everfixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wandring bark Whose worths unknown although his height be taken Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickles compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ nor no man ever loved 117 Accuse me thus that I have scanted all Wherein I should your great deserts repay Forgot upon your dearest love to call Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day That I have frequent been with unknown minds And given to time your own dearpurchased right That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight Book both my wilfulness and errors down And on just proof surmise accumulate Bring me within the level of your frown But shoot not at me in your wakened hate Since my appeal says I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love 118 Like as to make our appetite more keen With eager compounds we our palate urge As to prevent our maladies unseen We sicken to shun sickness when we purge Even so being full of your neercloying sweetness To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness To be diseased ere that there was true needing Thus policy in love t anticipate The ills that were not grew to faults assured And brought to medicine a healthful state Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured But thence I learn and find the lesson true Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 119 What potions have I drunk of Siren tears Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears Still losing when I saw my self to win What wretched errors hath my heart committed Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever O benefit of ill now I find true That better is by evil still made better And ruined love when it is built anew Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater So I return rebuked to my content And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent 120 That you were once unkind befriends me now And for that sorrow which I then did feel Needs must I under my transgression bow Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel For if you were by my unkindness shaken As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime O that our night of woe might have remembered My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits And soon to you as you to me then tendered The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits But that your trespass now becomes a fee Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me 121 Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed When not to be receives reproach of being And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed Not by our feeling but by others seeing For why should others false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood Or on my frailties why are frailer spies Which in their wills count bad what I think good No I am that I am and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own I may be straight though they themselves be bevel By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown Unless this general evil they maintain All men are bad and in their badness reign 122 Thy gift thy tables are within my brain Full charactered with lasting memory Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to eternity Or at the least so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist Till each to razed oblivion yield his partOf thee thy record never can be missed That poor retention could not so much hold Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score Therefore to give them from me was I bold To trust those tables that receive thee more To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me 123 No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel nothing strange They are but dressings of a former sight Our dates are brief and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told Thy registers and thee I both defy Not wondring at the present nor the past For thy records and what we see doth lie Made more or less by thy continual haste This I do vow and this shall ever be I will be true despite thy scythe and thee 124 If my dear love were but the child of state It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered As subject to times love or to times hate Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered No it was builded far from accident It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls It fears not policy that heretic Which works on leases of shortnumbered hours But all alone stands hugely politic That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers To this I witness call the fools of time Which die for goodness who have lived for crime 125 Weret aught to me I bore the canopy With my extern the outward honouring Or laid great bases for eternity Which proves more short than waste or ruining Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet forgoing simple savour Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent No let me be obsequious in thy heart And take thou my oblation poor but free Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art But mutual render only me for thee Hence thou suborned informer a true soul When most impeached stands least in thy control 126 O thou my lovely boy who in thy power Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour Who hast by waning grown and therein showst Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure She may detain but not still keep her treasure Her audit though delayed answered must be And her quietus is to render thee 127 In the old age black was not counted fair Or if it were it bore not beautys name But now is black beautys successive heir And beauty slandered with a bastard shame For since each hand hath put on natures power Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower But is profaned if not lives in disgrace Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem At such who not born fair no beauty lack Slandering creation with a false esteem Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe That every tongue says beauty should look so 128 How oft when thou my music music playst Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst The wiry concord that mine ear confounds Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap To kiss the tender inward of thy hand Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait Making dead wood more blest than living lips Since saucy jacks so happy are in this Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss 129 Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action and till action lust Is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight Past reason hunted and no sooner had Past reason hated as a swallowed bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad Mad in pursuit and in possession so Had having and in quest to have extreme A bliss in proof and proved a very woe Before a joy proposed behind a dream All this the world well knows yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 130 My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun Coral is far more red than her lips red If snow be white why then her breasts are dun If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head I have seen roses damasked red and white But no such roses see I in her cheeks And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks I love to hear her speak yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound I grant I never saw a goddess go My mistress when she walks treads on the ground And yet by heaven I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare 131 Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel Yet in good faith some say that thee behold Thy face hath not the power to make love groan To say they err I dare not be so bold Although I swear it to my self alone And to be sure that is not false I swear A thousand groans but thinking on thy face One on anothers neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgements place In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds And thence this slander as I think proceeds 132 Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain Have put on black and loving mourners be Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east Nor that full star that ushers in the even Doth half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning eyes become thy face O let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace And suit thy pity like in every part Then will I swear beauty herself is black And all they foul that thy complexion lack 133 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me Ist not enough to torture me alone But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken And my next self thou harder hast engrossed Of him my self and thee I am forsaken A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee Perforce am thine and all that is in me 134 So now I have confessed that he is thine And I my self am mortgaged to thy will My self Ill forfeit so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still But thou wilt not nor he will not be free For thou art covetous and he is kind He learned but suretylike to write for me Under that bond that him as fist doth bind The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take Thou usurer that putst forth all to use And sue a friend came debtor for my sake So him I lose through my unkind abuse Him have I lost thou hast both him and me He pays the whole and yet am I not free 135 Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will And Will to boot and Will in overplus More than enough am I that vex thee still To thy sweet will making addition thus Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine Shall will in others seem right gracious And in my will no fair acceptance shine The sea all water yet receives rain still And in abundance addeth to his store So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill Think all but one and me in that one Will 136 If thy soul check thee that I come so near Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will And will thy soul knows is admitted there Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love Ay fill it full with wills and my will one In things of great receipt with case we prove Among a number one is reckoned none Then in the number let me pass untold Though in thy stores account I one must be For nothing hold me so it please thee hold That nothing me a something sweet to thee Make but my name thy love and love that still And then thou lovst me for my name is Will 137 Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes That they behold and see not what they see They know what beauty is see where it lies Yet what the best is take the worst to be If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks Be anchored in the bay where all men ride Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied Why should my heart think that a several plot Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face In things right true my heart and eyes have erred And to this false plague are they now transferred 138 When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although she knows my days are past the best Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed But wherefore says she not she is unjust And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is in seeming trust And age in love loves not to have years told Therefore I lie with her and she with me And in our faults by lies we flattered be 139 O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue Use power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies And therefore from my face she turns my foes That they elsewhere might dart their injuries Yet do not so but since I am near slain Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain140 Be wise as thou art cruel do not press My tonguetied patience with too much disdain Lest sorrow lend me words and words express The manner of my pitywanting pain If I might teach thee wit better it were Though not to love yet love to tell me so As testy sick men when their deaths be near No news but health from their physicians know For if I should despair I should grow mad And in my madness might speak ill of thee Now this illwresting world is grown so bad Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be That I may not be so nor thou belied Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide 141 In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes For they in thee a thousand errors note But tis my heart that loves what they despise Who in despite of view is pleased to dote Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted Nor tender feeling to base touches prone Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be Only my plague thus far I count my gain That she that makes me sin awards me pain 142 Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving O but with mine compare thou thine own state And thou shalt find it merits not reproving Or if it do not from those lips of thine That have profaned their scarlet ornaments And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine Robbed others beds revenues of their rents Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee Root pity in thy heart that when it grows Thy pity may deserve to pitied be If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide By selfexample mayst thou be denied 143 Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch One of her feathered creatures broke away Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face Not prizing her poor infants discontent So runst thou after that which flies from thee Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me And play the mothers part kiss me be kind So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will If thou turn back and my loud crying still 144 Two loves I have of comfort and despair Which like two spirits do suggest me still The better angel is a man right fair The worser spirit a woman coloured ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her foul pride And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell But being both from me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out 145 Those lips that Loves own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said I hate To me that languished for her sake But when she saw my woeful state Straight in her heart did mercy come Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was used in giving gentle doom And taught it thus anew to greet I hate she altered with an end That followed it as gentle day Doth follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away I hate from hate away she threw And saved my life saying not you 146 Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth My sinful earth these rebel powers array Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth Painting thy outward walls so costly gay Why so large cost having so short a lease Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend Shall worms inheritors of this excess Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss And let that pine to aggravate thy store Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross Within be fed without be rich no more So shall thou feed on death that feeds on men And death once dead theres no more dying then 147 My love is as a fever longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill Th uncertain sickly appetite to please My reason the physician to my love Angry that his prescriptions are not kept Hath left me and I desperate now approve Desire is death which physic did except Past cure I am now reason is past care And franticmad with evermore unrest My thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are At random from the truth vainly expressed For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright Who art as black as hell as dark as night 148 O me what eyes hath love put in my head Which have no correspondence with true sight Or if they have where is my judgement fled That censures falsely what they see aright If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote What means the world to say it is not so If it be not then love doth well denote Loves eye is not so true as all mens no How can it O how can loves eye be true That is so vexed with watching and with tears No marvel then though I mistake my view The sun it self sees not till heaven clears O cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find 149 Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not When I against my self with thee partake Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self alltyrant for thy sake Who hateth thee that I do call my friend On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan What merit do I in my self respect That is so proud thy service to despise When all my best doth worship thy defect Commanded by the motion of thine eyes But love hate on for now I know thy mind Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind 150 O from what power hast thou this powerful might With insufficiency my heart to sway To make me give the lie to my true sight And swear that brightness doth not grace the day Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds Who taught thee how to make me love thee more The more I hear and see just cause of hate O though I love what others do abhor With others thou shouldst not abhor my state If thy unworthiness raised love in me More worthy I to be beloved of thee 151 Love is too young to know what conscience is Yet who knows not conscience is born of love Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove For thou betraying me I do betray My nobler part to my gross bodys treason My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason But rising at thy name doth point out thee As his triumphant prize proud of this pride He is contented thy poor drudge to be To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side No want of conscience hold it that I call Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall 152 In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn In vowing new hate after new love bearing But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee When I break twenty I am perjured most For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee And all my honest faith in thee is lost For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness Or made them swear against the thing they see For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I To swear against the truth so foul a lie 153 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep A maid of Dians this advantage found And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valleyfountain of that ground Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love A dateless lively heat still to endure And grew a seething bath which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired The boy for trial needs would touch my breast I sick withal the help of bath desired And thither hied a sad distempered guest But found no cure the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes 154 The little Lovegod lying once asleep Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep Came tripping by but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire Which many legions of true hearts had warmed And so the general of hot desire Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed This brand she quenched in a cool well by Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual Growing a bath and healthful remedy For men diseased but I my mistress thrall Came there for cure and this by that I prove Loves fire heats water water cools not love THE END ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL Contents ACT I Scene I Rossillon A

take no heed of thee Thourt an Athenian therefore welcome I myself would have no power prithee let my meat make thee silent APEMANTUS I scorn thy meat twould choke me for I should neer flatter thee O you gods what a number of men eats Timon and he sees em not It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one mans blood and all the madness is he cheers them up too I wonder men dare trust

ALCIBIADES So they were bleeding new my lord theres no meat like em I could wish my best friend at such a feast APEMANTUS Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then that then thou mightst kill em and bid me to em FIRST LORD Might we but have that happiness my lord that you would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect TIMON O no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you How had you been my friends else Why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf And thus far I confirm you O you gods think I what need we have any friends if we should neer have need of em They were the most needless creatures living should we neer have use for em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious comfort tis to have so many like brothers commanding one anothers fortunes O joys een made away eret can be born Mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks To forget their faults I drink to you

Music Enter a masque of Ladies as Amazons with lutes in their hands dancing and playing APEMANTUS Hoyday What a sweep of vanity comes this way They dance They are madwomen Like madness is the glory of this life As this pomp shows to a little oil and root We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves And spend our flatteries to drink those men Upon whose age we void it up again With poisonous spite and envy Who lives thats not depraved or depraves Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves Of their friends gift I should fear those that dance before me now Would one day stamp upon me T has been done Men shut their doors against a setting sun The Lords rise from table with much adoring of Timon and to show their loves each singles out an Amazon and all dance men with women a lofty strain or two to the hautboys and cease TIMON You have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies Set a fair fashion on our entertainment Which was not half so beautiful and kind You have added worth unto t

worthily entertained Exit Servant Enter a third Servant How now What news THIRD SERVANT Please you my lord that honourable gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company tomorrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds TIMON Ill hunt with him and let them be received Not without fair reward Exit Servant FLAVIUS Aside What will this come to He commands us to provide and give great gifts And all out of an empty coffer Nor will he know his purse or yield me this To show him what a beggar his heart is Being of no power to make his wishes good His promises fly so beyond his state That what he speaks is all in debt he owes For every word He is so kind that he now Pays interest for t his lands put to their books Well would I were gently put out of office Before I were forced out Happier is he that has no friend to feed Than such that do een enemies exceed I bleed inwardly for my lord Exit TIMON You do yourselves much wrong You bate too much of your own merits Here my lord a trifle of our love SECOND LORD With more than common thanks I will receive it THIRD LORD O hes the very soul of bounty TIMON And now I remember my lord you gave good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on Tis yours because you liked it THIRD LORD O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that TIMON You may take my word my lord I know no man Can justly praise but what he does affect I weigh my friends affection with mine own Ill tell you true Ill call to you ALL LORDS O none so welcome TIMON I take all and your several visitations So kind to heart tis not enough to give Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends And neer be weary Alcibiades Thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich It comes in charity to thee for all thy living Is mongst the dead and all the lands thou hast Lie in a pitched field ALCIBIADES Ay defiled land my lord FIRST LORD We are so virtuously bound TIMON And so am I to you SECOND LORD So infinitely endeared TIMON All to you Lights more lights FIRST LORD The best of happiness honour and fortunes keep with you Lord Timon TIMON Ready for his friends Exeunt all but Apemantus and Timon APEMANTUS What a coils here Serving of becks and jutting out of bums I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums That are given for em Friendships full of dregs Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies TIMON Now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen I would be good to thee APEMANTUS No Ill nothing for if I should be bribed too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster Thou givst so long Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly What needs these feasts pomps and vainglories TIMON Nay an you begin to rail on society once I am sworn not to give regard to you Farewell and come with better music Exit APEMANTUS So Thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then Ill lock thy heaven from thee O that mens ears should be To counsel deaf but not to flattery Exit ACT II SCENE I Athens A room in a senators house Enter a Senator with papers SENATOR And late five thousand To Varro and to Isidore He owes nine thousand besides my former sum Which makes it fiveandtwenty Still in motion Of raging waste It cannot hold it will not If I want gold steal but a beggars dog And give it Timon why the dog coins gold If I would sell my horse and buy

Thus yields the cedar to the axes edge Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle Under whose shade the ramping lion slept Whose top branch overpeered Joves spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winters powrful wind These eyes that now are dimmed with deaths black veil Have been as piercing as the midday sun To search the secret treasons of the world The wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood Were likened oft to kingly sepulchres For who lived King but I could dig his grave And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow Lo now my glory smeared in dust and blood My parks my walks my

I mean my lords those powers that the Queen Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast And as we hear march on to fight with us GEORGE A little gale will soon disperse that cloud And blow it to the source from whence it came Thy very beams will dry those vapours up For every cloud engenders not a storm RICHARD The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong And Somerset with Oxford fled to her If she have time to breathe be well assured Her faction will be full as strong as ours KING EDWARD We are advertised by our loving friends That they do hold their course toward Tewkesbury We having now the

there you quickly sink Bestride the rock the tide will wash you off Or else you famish thats a threefold death This speak I lords to let you understand If case some one of you would fly from us That theres no hopedfor mercy with the brothers More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks Why courage then What cannot be avoided Twere childish weakness to lament or fear PRINCE EDWARD Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit Should if a coward heard her speak these words Infuse his breast with magnanimity And make him naked foil a man at arms I speak not this as doubting any here For did I but suspect a fearful man He should have leave to go away betimes Lest in our need he might infect another And make him of the like spirit to himself If any such be here as God forbid Let him depart

RICHARD Good day my lord What at your book so hard KING HENRY Ay my good lordmy lord I should say rather Tis sin to flatter good was little better Good Gloucester and good devil were alike And both preposterous therefore not good lord RICHARD Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer Exit Lieutenant KING HENRY So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece And next his throat unto the butchers knife What scene of death hath Roscius now to act RICHARD Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind The thief doth fear each bush an officer KING HENRY The bird that hath been limed in a bush With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush And I the hapless male to one sweet bird Have now the fatal object in my eye Where my poor young was limed was caught and killed RICHARD Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete That taught his son the office of a fowl And yet for all his wings the fool was drowned KING HENRY I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus Thy father Minos that denied our course The sun that seared the wings of my sweet boy Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words My breast can better brook thy daggers point Than can my ears that tragic history But wherefore dost thou come Is t for my life RICHARD Thinkst thou I am an executioner KING HENRY A persecutor I am sure thou art If murdering innocents be executing Why then thou art an executioner RICHARD Thy son I killed for his presumption KING HENRY Hadst thou been killed when first thou didst presume Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine And thus I prophesy that many a thousand Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear And many an old mans sigh and many a widows And many an orphans waterstanding eye Men for their sons wives for their husbands Orphans for their parents timeless death Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born The owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign The nightcrow cried aboding luckless time Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees The raven rooked her on the chimneys top And chattring pies in dismal discord sung Thy mother felt more than a mothers pain And yet brought forth less than a mothers hope To wit an indigested and deformed lump Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born To signify thou camst to bite the world And if the rest be true which I have heard Thou camst RICHARD Ill hear no more Die prophet in thy speech Stabs him For this amongst the rest was I ordained KING HENRY Ay and for much more slaughter after this O God forgive my sins and pardon thee Dies RICHARD What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted See how my sword weeps for the poor Kings death O may such purple tears be always shed From those that wish the downfall of our house If any spark of life be yet remaining Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither Stabs him again I that have neither pity love nor fear Indeed tis true that Henry told me of For I have often heard my mother say I came into the world with my legs forward Had I not reason think ye to make haste And seek their ruin that usurped our right The midwife wondered and the women cried O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth And so I was which plainly signified That I should snarl and bite and play the dog Then since the heavens have shaped my body so Let hell make crooked my mind to answer it I have no brother I am like no brother And this word love which greybeards call divine Be resident in men like one another And not in me I am myself alone Clarence beware thou keepst me from the light But I will sort a pitchy day for thee For I will buzz abroad such prophecies That Edward shall be fearful of his life And then to purge his fear Ill be thy death King Henry and the Prince his son are gone Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest Counting myself but bad till I be best Ill throw thy body in another room And triumph Henry in thy day of doom Exit with the body SCENE VII London The Palace Flourish Enter King Edward Queen Elizabeth George Richard Hastings Nurse carrying infant Prince

thou mightst repossess the crown in peace And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain RICHARD Aside Ill blast his harvest if your head were laid For yet I am not looked on in the world This shoulder

delights Having my countrys peace and brothers loves GEORGE What will your Grace have done with Margaret Reignier her father to the King of France Hath pawned the Sicils and Jerusalem And hither have

and Suffolk GLOUCESTER Brave peers of England pillars of the state To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief Your grief the common grief of all the land What Did my brother Henry spend his youth His valour coin and people in the wars Did he so often lodge in open field In winters cold and summers parching heat To conquer France his true inheritance And did my brother Bedford toil his wits To keep by policy what Henry got Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick Received deep scars in France and Normandy Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself With all the learned council of the realm Studied so long sat in the council house Early and late debating to and fro How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe And had his highness in his infancy Crowned in Paris in despite of foes And shall these labours and these honours die Shall Henrys conquest Bedfords vigilance Your deeds of war and all our counsel die O peers of England shameful is this league Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame Blotting your names from books of memory Razing the characters of your renown Defacing monuments of conquered France Undoing all as all had never been CARDINAL Nephew what means this passionate discourse This peroration with such circumstance For France tis ours and we will keep it still GLOUCESTER Ay uncle we will keep it if we can But now it is impossible we should Suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purse SALISBURY Now by the death of Him that died for all These counties were the keys of Normandy But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son WARWICK For grief that they are past recovery For were there hope to conquer them again My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears Anjou and Maine Myself did win them both Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer And are the cities that I got with wounds Delivered up again with peaceful words Mort Dieu YORK For Suffolks duke may he be suffocate That dims the honour of this warlike isle France should have torn and rent my very heart Before I would have yielded to this league I never read but Englands kings have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives And our King Henry gives away his own To match with her that brings no vantages GLOUCESTER A proper

Gloucester now ye grow too hot It was the pleasure of my lord the King GLOUCESTER My Lord of Winchester I know your mind Tis not my speeches that you do mislike But tis my presence that doth trouble ye Rancour will out Proud prelate in thy face I see thy fury If I longer stay We shall begin our ancient bickerings Lordings farewell and say when I am gone I prophesied France will be lost ere long Exit CARDINAL So there goes our Protector in a rage Tis known to you he is mine enemy Nay more an enemy unto you all And no great friend I fear me to the King Consider lords he is the next of blood And heir apparent to the English crown Had Henry got an empire by his marriage And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west Theres reason he should be displeased at it Look to it lords Let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect What though the common people favour him Calling him Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice Jesu maintain your royal excellence With God preserve the good Duke Humphrey I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss He will be found a dangerous Protector BUCKINGHAM Why should he then protect our sovereign He being of age to govern of himself Cousin of Somerset join you with me And all together with the Duke of Suffolk Well quickly hoist Duke Humphrey from his seat CARDINAL This weighty business will not brook delay Ill to the Duke of Suffolk presently Exit SOMERSET Cousin of Buckingham though Humphreys pride And greatness of his place be grief to us Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal His insolence is more intolerable Than all the princes in the land beside If Gloucester be displaced hell be Protector BUCKINGHAM Or thou or I Somerset will be Protector Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal Exeunt Buckingham and Somerset SALISBURY Pride went before Ambition follows him While these do labour for their own preferment Behoves it us to labour for the realm I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Did bear him like a noble gentleman Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal More like a soldier than a man o th church As stout and proud as he were lord of all Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal Warwick my son the comfort of my age Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping Hath won the greatest favour of the commons Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey And brother York thy acts in Ireland In bringing them to civil discipline Thy late exploits done in the heart of France When thou wert regent for our sovereign Have made thee feared and honoured of the people Join we together for the public good In what we can to bridle and suppress The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal With Somersets and Buckinghams ambition And as we may cherish Duke Humphreys deeds While they do tend the profit of the land WARWICK So God help Warwick as he loves the land And common profit of his country YORK And so says York Aside for he hath greatest cause SALISBURY Then lets make haste away and look unto the main WARWICK Unto the main O father Maine is lost That Maine which by main force Warwick did win And would have kept so long as breath did last Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine Which I will win from France or else be slain Exeunt Warwick and Salisbury YORK Anjou and Maine are given to the French Paris is lost the state of Normandy Stands on a tickle point now they are gone Suffolk concluded on the articles The peers agreed and Henry was well pleased To change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter I cannot blame them all What ist to them Tis thine they give away and not their own Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage And purchase friends and give to courtesans Still revelling like lords till all be gone Whileas the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands And shakes his head and trembling stands aloofWhile all is shared and all is borne away Ready to starve and dare not touch his own So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue While his own lands are bargained for and sold Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt Unto the princes heart of Calydon Anjou and Maine both given unto the French Cold news for me for I had hope of France Even as I have of fertile Englands soil A day will come when York shall claim his own And therefore I will take the Nevilles parts And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey And when I spy advantage claim the crown For thats the golden mark I seek to hit Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist Nor wear the diadem upon his head Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown Then York be still awhile till time do serve Watch thou and wake when others be asleep To pry into the secrets of the state Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and Englands dearbought Queen And Humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed And in my standard bear the arms of York To grapple with the house of Lancaster And force perforce Ill make him yield the crown Whose bookish rule hath pulled fair England down Exit SCENE II The Duke of Gloucesters House Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his wife Eleanor ELEANOR Why droops my lord like overripened corn Hanging the head at Ceres plenteous load Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows As frowning at the favours of

grovel on thy face Until thy head be circled with the same Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold What ist too short Ill lengthen it with mine And having both together heaved it up Well both together lift our heads to heaven And never more abase our sight so low As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground GLOUCESTER O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts And may that hour when I imagine ill Against my King and nephew virtuous Henry Be my last breathing in this mortal world My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad ELEANOR What dreamed my lord Tell me and Ill requite it With sweet rehearsal of my mornings dream GLOUCESTER Methought this staff mine officebadge in court Was broke in twain by whom I have forgot But as I think it was by th Cardinal And on the pieces of the broken wand Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset And William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk This was my dream what it doth bode God knows

Eleanor then must I chide outright Presumptuous dame illnurtured Eleanor Art thou not second woman in the realm And the Protectors wife beloved of him Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command Above

anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her with bitter words Why look you so upon me PHOEBE For no ill will I bear you ROSALIND I pray you do not fall in love with me For I am falser than vows made in wine Besides I like you not If you will know my house Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard Come sister Shepherdess look on him better And be not proud Though all the world could see None could be so abused in sight as he Come to our flock Exeunt Rosalind Celia and Corin PHOEBE Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might Who ever loved that loved not at first sight SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe PHOEBE Ha what sayst thou Silvius SILVIUS Sweet Phoebe pity me PHOEBE Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius SILVIUS Wherever sorrow is relief would be If you do sorrow at my grief in love By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined PHOEBE Thou hast my love Is not that neighbourly SILVIUS I would have you PHOEBE Why that were covetousness Silvius the time was that I hated thee And yet it is not that I bear thee love But since that thou canst talk of love so well Thy company which erst was irksome to me I will endure and Ill employ thee too But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed SILVIUS So holy and so perfect is my love And I in such a poverty of grace That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps Loose now and then A scattered smile and that Ill live upon PHOEBE Knowst thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile SILVIUS Not very well but I have met him oft And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of PHOEBE Think not I love him though I ask for him Tis but a peevish boyyet he talks well But what care I for words Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear It is a pretty youthnot very pretty But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him Hell make a proper man The best thing in him Is his complexion and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall His leg is but soso and yet tis well There was a pretty redness in his lip A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek Twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask There be some women Silvius had they marked him In parcels as I did would have gone near To fall in love with him but for my part I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And now I am remembered scorned at me I marvel why I answered not again But thats all one omittance is no quittance Ill write to him a very taunting letter And thou shalt bear it Wilt thou Silvius SILVIUS Phoebe with all my heart PHOEBE Ill write it straight The matters in my head and in my heart I will be bitter with him and passing short Go with me Silvius Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I The Forest of Arden Enter Rosalind Celia and Jaques JAQUES I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards JAQUES Why tis good to be sad and say nothing ROSALIND Why then tis good to be a post JAQUES I have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands JAQUES Yes I have gained my experience ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sadand to travel for it too Enter Orlando ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind JAQUES Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller Look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Exit Jaques Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise ROSALIND Break an hours promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant him heartwhole ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snail ORLANDO Of a snail ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his heada better jointure I think than you make a woman Besides he brings his destiny with him ORLANDO Whats that ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife ORLANDO Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit ORLANDO What of my suit ROSALIND Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of herROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these are all lies Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all ORLANDO And wilt thou have me ROSALIND Ay and twenty such ORLANDO What sayest thou ROSALIND Are you not good ORLANDO I hope so ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good thingCome sister you shall be the priest and marry usGive me your hand OrlandoWhat do you say sister ORLANDO Pray thee marry us CELIA I cannot say the words ROSALIND You must begin Will you Orlando CELIA Go toWill you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind ORLANDO I will ROSALIND Ay but when ORLANDO Why now as fast as she can marry us ROSALIND Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife ORLANDO I take thee Rosalind for wife ROSALIND I might ask you for your commission But I do take thee Orlando for my husband Theres a girl goes before the priest and certainly a womans thought runs before her actions ORLANDO So do all thoughts They are winged ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her ORLANDO For ever and a day ROSALIND Say a day without the ever No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed Maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyena and that when thou are inclined to sleep ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so ROSALIND By my life she will do as I do ORLANDO O but she is wise ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser the waywarder Make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement Shut that and twill out at the keyhole Stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say Wit whither wilt ROSALIND Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that ROSALIND Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool ORLANDO For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee ROSALIND Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours ORLANDO I must attend the Duke at dinner By two oclock I will be with thee again ROSALIND Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would prove My friends told me as much and I thought no less That flattering tongue of yours won me Tis but one cast away and so come death Two oclock is your hour ORLANDO Ay sweet Rosalind ROSALIND By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore beware my censure and keep your promise ORLANDO With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind So adieu ROSALIND Well Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try Adieu Exit Orlando CELIA You have simply misused our sex in your loveprate We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest ROSALIND O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the Bay of Portugal CELIA Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out ROSALIND No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love Ill tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando Ill go find a shadow and sigh till he come CELIA And Ill sleep Exeunt SCENE II Another part of the Forest Enter Jaques and Lords like foresters JAQUES Which is he that killed the deer FIRST LORD Sir it was I JAQUES Lets present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deers horns upon his head for a branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purpose SECOND LORD Yes sir JAQUES Sing it Tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough SONG SECOND LORD Sings What shall he have that killed the deer His leather skin and horns to wear Then sing him home The rest shall bear this burden Take thou no scorn to wear the horn It was a crest ere thou wast born Thy fathers father wore it And thy father bore it The horn the horn the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn Exeunt SCENE III Another part of the Forest Enter Rosalind and Celia ROSALIND How say you now Is it not past two oclock And here much Orlando CELIA I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep Enter Silvius Look who comes here SILVIUS My errand is to you fair youth My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this Giving a letter I know not the contents but as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it It bears an angry tenor Pardon me I am but as a guiltless messenger ROSALIND Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all She says I am not fair that I lack manners She calls me proud and that she could not love me Were man as rare as phoenix Ods my will Her love is not the hare that I do hunt Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well This is a letter of your own device SILVIUS No I protest I know not the contents Phoebe did write it ROSALIND Come come you are a fool And turned into the extremity of love I saw her hand She has a leathern hand A freestonecoloured hand I verily did think That her old gloves were on but twas her hands She has a huswifes handbut thats no matter I say she never did invent this letter This is a mans invention and his hand SILVIUS Sure it is hers ROSALIND Why tis a boisterous and a cruel style A style for challengers Why she defies me Like Turk to Christian Womens gentle brain Could not drop forth such giantrude invention Such Ethiop words blacker in their effect Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter SILVIUS So please you for I never heard it yet Yet heard too much of Phoebes cruelty ROSALIND She Phoebes me Mark how the tyrant writes Reads Art thou god to shepherd turned That a maidens heart hath burned Can a woman rail thus SILVIUS Call you this railing ROSALIND Why thy godhead laid apart Warrst thou with a womans heart Did you ever hear such railing Whiles the eye of man did woo me That could do no vengeance to me Meaning me a beast If the scorn of your bright eyne Have power to raise such love in mine Alack in me what strange effect Would they work in mild aspect Whiles you chid me I did love How then might your prayers move He that brings this love to thee Little knows this love in me And by him seal up thy mind Whether that thy youth and kind Will the faithful offer take Of me and all that I can make Or else by him my love deny And then Ill study how to die SILVIUS Call you this chiding CELIA Alas poor shepherd ROSALIND Do you pity him No he deserves no pityWilt thou love such a woman What to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee Not to be endured Well go your way to her for I see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not I will never have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company Exit Silvius Enter Oliver OLIVER Good morrow fair ones Pray you if you know Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees CELIA West of this place down in the neighbour bottom The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place But at this hour the house doth keep itself Theres none within OLIVER If that an eye may profit by a tongue Then should I know you by description Such garments and such years The boy is fair Of female favour and bestows himself Like a ripe sister the woman low And browner than her brother Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for CELIA It is no boast being asked to say we are OLIVER Orlando doth commend him to you both And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin Are you he ROSALIND I am What must we understand by this OLIVER Some of my shame if you will know of me What man I am and how and why and where This handkerchief was stained CELIA I pray you tell it OLIVER When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour and pacing through the forest Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy Lo what befell He threw his eye aside And mark what object did present itself Under an oak whose boughs were mossed with ageAnd high top bald with dry antiquity A wretched ragged man oergrown with hair Lay sleeping on his back about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself Who with her head nimble in threats approached The opening of his mouth But suddenly Seeing Orlando it unlinked itself And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush under which bushs shade A lioness with udders all drawn dry Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir For tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead This seen Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother his elder brother CELIA O I have heard him speak of that same brother And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men OLIVER And well he might so do For well I know he was unnatural ROSALIND But to Orlando did he leave him there Food to the sucked and hungry lioness OLIVER Twice did he turn his back and purposed so But kindness nobler ever than revenge And nature stronger than his just occasion Made him give battle to the lioness Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awaked CELIA Are you his brother ROSALIND Was it you he rescued CELIA Wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him OLIVER Twas I but tis not I I do not shame To tell you what I was since my conversion So sweetly tastes being the thing I am ROSALIND But for the bloody napkin OLIVER By and by When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed As how I came into that desert place In brief he led me to the gentle Duke Who gave me fresh array and entertainment Committing me unto my brothers love Who led me instantly unto his cave There stripped himself and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away Which all this while had bled and now he fainted And cried in fainting upon Rosalind Brief I recovered him bound up his wound And after some small space being strong at heart He sent me hither stranger as I am To tell this story that you might excuse His broken promise and to give this napkin Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind Rosalind faints CELIA Why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede OLIVER Many will swoon when they do look on blood CELIA There is more in it CousinGanymede OLIVER Look he recovers ROSALIND I would I were at home CELIA Well lead you thither I pray you will you take him by the arm OLIVER Be of good cheer youth You a man You lack a mans heart ROSALIND I do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited Heighho OLIVER This was not counterfeit There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest ROSALIND Counterfeit I assure you OLIVER Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man ROSALIND So I do But i faith I should have been a woman by right CELIA Come you look paler and paler Pray you draw homewards Good sir go with us OLIVER That will I for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother Rosalind ROSALIND I shall devise something But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him Will you go Exeunt ACT V SCENE I The Forest of Arden Enter Touchstone and Audrey TOUCHSTONE We shall find a time Audrey patience

TOUCHSTONE Give me your hand Art thou learned WILLIAM No sir TOUCHSTONE Then learn this of me to have is to have For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink being poured out of cup into a glass by

wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly the Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he

night on Wednesday morn I prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith hes penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason Save that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath taen your part to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do much OTHELLO Prithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothingDESDEMONA Why this is not a boon Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing

No further harm OTHELLO Why of thy thought Iago IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her OTHELLO O yes and went between us very oft IAGO Indeed OTHELLO Indeed Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that Is he not honest IAGO Honest my lord OTHELLO Honest ay honest IAGO My lord for aught I know OTHELLO What dost thou think IAGO Think my lord OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou likst not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit if thou dost love me Show me thy thought IAGO My lord you know I love you OTHELLO I think thou dost And for I know thourt full of love and honesty And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man thats just Theyre close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule IAGO For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest OTHELLO I think so too IAGO Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem IAGO Why then I think Cassios an honest man OTHELLO Nay yet theres more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words IAGO Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As wheres that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear A stranger to thy thoughts IAGO I do beseech you Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my natures plague To spy into abuses and of my jealousy Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts OTHELLO What dost thou mean IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed OTHELLO By heaven Ill know thy thoughts IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody OTHELLO Ha IAGO O beware my lord of jealousy It is the greeneyd monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he oer Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves OTHELLO O misery IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy OTHELLO Why why is this Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolvd exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago Ill see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of selfbounty be abusd Look tot I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands Their best conscience Is not to leave undone but keep unknown OTHELLO Dost thou say so IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most OTHELLO And so she did IAGO Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever IAGO I see this hath a little dashd your spirits OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot IAGO Trust me I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see youre movd I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion OTHELLO I will not IAGO Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend My lord I see youre movd OTHELLO No not much movd I do not think but Desdemonas honest IAGO Long live she so And long live you to think so OTHELLO And yet how nature erring from itself IAGO Ay theres the point As to be bold with you Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends Foh One may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent OTHELLO Farewell farewell If more thou dost perceive let me know more Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago IAGO Going My lord I take my leave OTHELLO Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds IAGO Returning My lord I would I might entreat your honour To scan this thing no further Leave it to time Though it be fit that Cassio have his place For sure he fills it up with great ability Yet if you please to hold him off awhile You shall by that perceive him and his means Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity Much will be seen in that In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears As worthy cause I have to fear I am And hold her free I do beseech your honour OTHELLO Fear not my government IAGO I once more take my leave Exit OTHELLO This fellows of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings Id whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune Haply for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have or for I am declind Into the vale of yearsyet thats not much Shes gone I am abusd and my relief Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapour of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others uses Yet tis the plague of great ones Prerogativd are they less than the base Tis destiny unshunnable like death Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken Desdemona comes If she be false O then heaven mocks itself Ill not believet Enter Desdemona and Emilia DESDEMONA How now my dear Othello Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presence OTHELLO I am to blame DESDEMONA Why do you speak so faintly Are you not well OTHELLO I have a pain upon my forehead here DESDEMONA Faith thats with watching twill away again Let me but bind it hard within this hour It will be well OTHELLO Your napkin is too little He puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it Let it alone Come Ill go in with you DESDEMONA I am very sorry that you are not well Exeunt Othello and Desdemona EMILIA I am glad I have found this napkin This was her first remembrance from the Moor My wayward husband hath a hundred times Wood me to steal it But she so loves the token For he conjurd her she should ever keep it That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to Ill have the work taen out And givet Iago What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy Enter Iago IAGO How now What do you here alone EMILIA Do not you chide I have a thing for you IAGO A thing for me It is a common thing EMILIA Ha IAGO To have a foolish wife EMILIA O is that all What will you give me now For that same handkerchief IAGO What handkerchief EMILIA What handkerchief Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me steal IAGO Hast stoln it from her EMILIA No faith she let it drop by negligence And to the advantage I being here took t up Look here it is IAGO A good wench give it me EMILIA What will you do witht that you have been so earnestTo have me filch it IAGO Snatching it Why whats that to you EMILIA If it be not for some purpose of import Give t me again Poor lady shell run mad When she shall lack it IAGO Be not acknown ont I have use for it Go leave me Exit Emilia I will in Cassios lodging lose this napkin And let him find it Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ This may do something The Moor already changes with my poison Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so Enter Othello Look where he comes Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owdst yesterday OTHELLO Ha ha false to me IAGO Why how now general No more of that OTHELLO Avaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack I swear tis better to be much abusd Than but to knowt a little IAGO How now my lord OTHELLO What sense had I of her stoln hours of lust I sawt not thought it not it harmd not me I slept the next night well was free and merry I found not Cassios kisses on her lips He that is robbd not wanting what is stoln Let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all IAGO I am sorry to hear this OTHELLO I had been happy if the general camp Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body So I had nothing known O now for ever Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars That make ambition virtue O farewell Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war And O you mortal engines whose rude throats The immortal Joves dread clamours counterfeit Farewell Othellos occupations gone IAGO Ist possible my lord OTHELLO Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof Or by the worth of mans eternal soul Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my wakd wrath IAGO Ist come to this OTHELLO Make me to seet or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life IAGO My noble lord OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me Never pray more Abandon all remorse On horrors head horrors accumulate Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazd For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that IAGO O grace O heaven defend me Are you a man Have you a soul or sense God be wi you Take mine officeO wretched fool That livst to make thine honesty a vice O monstrous world Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe I thank you for this profit and from hence Ill love no friend sith love breeds such offence OTHELLO Nay stay Thou shouldst be honest IAGO I should be wise for honestys a fool And loses that it works for OTHELLO By the world I think my wife be honest and think she is not I think that thou art just and think thou art not Ill have some proof her name that was as fresh As Dians visage is now begrimd and black As mine own face If there be cords or knives Poison or fire or suffocating streams Ill not endure t Would I were satisfied IAGO I see sir you are eaten up with passion I do repent me that I put it to you You would be satisfied OTHELLO Would Nay I will IAGO And may but how How satisfied my lord Would you the supervisor grossly gape on Behold her toppd OTHELLO Death and damnation O IAGO It were a tedious difficulty I think To bring them to that prospect Damn them then If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own What then How then What shall I say Wheres satisfaction It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk But yet I say If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may havet OTHELLO Give me a living reason shes disloyal IAGO I do not like the office But sith I am enterd in this cause so far Prickd to t by foolish honesty and love I will go on I lay with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep There are a kind of men so loose of soul That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs One of this kind is Cassio In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona Let us be wary let us hide our loves And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard As if he pluckd up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips then laid his leg Over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then Cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor OTHELLO O monstrous monstrous IAGO Nay this was but his dream OTHELLO But this denoted a foregone conclusion Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream IAGO And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly OTHELLO Ill tear her all to pieces IAGO Nay but be wise Yet we see nothing done She may be honest yet Tell me but this Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand OTHELLO I gave her such a one twas my first gift IAGO I know not that but such a handkerchief I am sure it was your wifes did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with OTHELLO If it be that IAGO If it be that or any that was hers It speaks against her with the other proofs OTHELLO O that the slave had forty thousand lives One is too poor too weak for my revenge Now do I see tis true Look here Iago All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven Tis gone Arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught For tis of aspics tongues IAGO Yet be content OTHELLO O blood Iago blood IAGO Patience I say Your mind perhaps may change OTHELLO Never Iago Like to the Pontic Sea Whose icy current and compulsive course Neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven In the due reverence of a sacred vow Kneels I here engage my words IAGO Do not rise yet Kneels Witness you everburning lights above You elements that clip us round about Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit hands heart To wrongd Othellos service Let him command And to obey shall be in me remorse What bloody business ever They rise OTHELLO I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous And will upon the instant put thee to t Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassios not alive IAGO My friend is dead Tis done at your request But let her live OTHELLO Damn her lewd minx O damn her damn her Come go with me apart I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant IAGO I am your own for ever Exeunt SCENE IV Cyprus Before the Castle Enter Desdemona Emilia and Clown DESDEMONA Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies CLOWN I dare not say he lies anywhere DESDEMONA Why man CLOWN Hes a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing DESDEMONA Go to Where lodges he CLOWN To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie DESDEMONA Can anything be made of this CLOWN I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat DESDEMONA Can you inquire him out and be edified by report CLOWN I will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer DESDEMONA Seek him bid him come hither Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well CLOWN To do this is within the compass of mans wit and therefore I will attempt the doing it Exit DESDEMONA Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia EMILIA I know not madam DESDEMONA Believe me I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are it were enough To put him to ill thinking EMILIA Is he not jealous DESDEMONA Who he I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humours from him EMILIA Look where he comes Enter

which I gave you DESDEMONA I have it not about me OTHELLO Not DESDEMONA No faith my lord OTHELLO That is a fault That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give She was a charmer and could almost read The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love But if she lost it Or made a gift of it my fathers eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies she dying gave it me And bid me when my fate would have me wive To give it her I did so and take heed ont Make it a darling like your precious eye To loset or givet away were such perdition As nothing else could match DESDEMONA Ist possible OTHELLO Tis true Theres magic in the web of it A sibyl that had numberd in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses In her prophetic fury sewd the work The worms were hallowd that did breed the silk And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conservd of maidens hearts DESDEMONA Indeed Ist true OTHELLO Most veritable therefore look to t well DESDEMONA Then would to God that I had never seen t OTHELLO Ha whereforeDESDEMONA Why do you speak so startingly and rash OTHELLO Ist lost ist gone

mortal kind That nor my service past nor present sorrows Nor purposd merit in futurity Can ransom me into his love again But to know so must be my benefit So shall I clothe me in a forcd content And shut myself up in some other course To fortunes alms DESDEMONA Alas thricegentle Cassio My advocation is not now in tune My lord is not my lord nor should I know him Were he in favour as in humour alterd So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech You must awhile be patient What I can do I will and more I will Than for myself I dare Let that suffice you IAGO Is my lord angry EMILIA He went hence but now And certainly in strange unquietness IAGO Can he be angry I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air And like the devil from his very arm Puffd his own brother and can he be angry Something of moment then I will go meet him Theres matter int indeed if he be angry DESDEMONA I prithee do so Exit Iago Something sure of state Either from Venice or some unhatchd practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases Mens natures wrangle with inferior things Though great ones are their object Tis even so For let our finger ache and it indues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain Nay we must think men are not gods Nor of them look for such observancy As fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia I was unhandsome warrior as I am Arraigning his unkindness with my soul But now I find I had subornd the witness And hes indicted falsely EMILIA Pray heaven it be state matters as you think And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you DESDEMONA Alas the day I never gave him cause EMILIA But jealous souls will not be answerd so They are not ever jealous for the cause But jealous for they are jealous tis a monster Begot upon itself born on itself DESDEMONA Heaven keep that monster from Othellos mind EMILIA Lady amen DESDEMONA I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout If I do find him fit Ill move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost CASSIO I humbly thank your ladyship

base a slave The baser is he coming from a king To shame his hope with deeds degenerate The mightier man the mightier is the thing That makes him honoured or begets him hate For greatest scandal waits on greatest state The moon being clouded presently is missed But little stars may hide them when they list The crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire And unperceived fly with the filth away But if the like the snowwhite swan desire The stain upon his silver down will stay Poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day Gnats are unnoted wheresoeer they fly But eagles gazed upon with every eye Out idle words servants to shallow fools Unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators Busy yourselves in skillcontending schools Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters To trembling clients be you mediators For me I force not argument a straw Since that my case is past the help of law In vain I rail at Opportunity At Time at Tarquin and uncheerful night In vain I cavil with mine infamy In vain I spurn at my confirmed despite This helpless smoke of words doth me no right The remedy indeed to do me good Is to let forth my foul defiled blood Poor hand why quiverst thou at this decree Honour thyself to rid me of this shame For if I die my honour lives in thee But if I live thou livst in my defame Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame And wast afeared to scratch her wicked foe Kill both thyself and her for yielding so This said from her betumbled couch she starteth To find some desprate instrument of death But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth To make more vent for passage of her breath Which thronging through her lips so vanisheth As smoke from tna that in air consumes Or that which from discharged cannon fumes In vain quoth she I live and seek in vain Some happy mean to end a hapless life I feared by Tarquins falchion to be slain Yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife But when I feared I was a loyal wife So am I nowO no that cannot be Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me O that is gone for which I sought to live And therefore now I need not fear to die To clear this spot by death at least I give A badge of fame to slanders livery A dying life to living infamy Poor helpless help the treasure stoln away To burn the guiltless casket where it lay Well well dear Collatine thou shalt not know The stained taste of violated troth I will not wrong thy true affection so To flatter thee with an infringed oath This bastard graff shall never come to growth He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute That thou art doting father of his fruit Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thoughtNor laugh with his companions at thy state But thou shalt know thy intrest was not bought Basely with gold but stoln from forth thy gate For me I am the mistress of my fate And with my trespass never will dispense Till life to death acquit my forced offence I will not poison thee with my attaint Nor fold my fault in cleanlycoined excuses My sable ground of sin I will not paint To hide the truth of this false nights abuses My tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices As from a mountainspring that feeds a dale Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale By this lamenting Philomel had ended The welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow And solemn night with slow sad gait descended To ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see And therefore still in night would cloistered be Revealing day through every cranny spies And seems to point her out where she sits weeping To whom she sobbing speaks O eye of eyes Why pryst thou through my window Leave thy peeping Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light For day hath naught to do whats done by night Thus cavils she with everything she sees True grief is fond and testy as a child Who wayward once his mood with naught agrees Old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild Continuance tames the one the other wild Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still With too much labour drowns for want of skill So she deepdrenched in a sea of care Holds disputation with each thing she views And to herself all sorrow doth compare No object but her passions strength renews And as one shifts another straight ensues Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words Sometime tis mad and too much talk affords The little birds that tune their mornings joy Make her moans mad with their sweet melody For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy Sad souls are slain in merry company Grief best is pleased with griefs society True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed When with like semblance it is sympathized Tis double death to drown in ken of shore He ten times pines that pines beholding food To see the salve doth make the wound ache more Great grief grieves most at that would do it good Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood Who being stopped the bounding banks oerflows Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows You mocking birds quoth she your tunes entomb Within your hollowswelling feathered breasts And in my hearing be you mute and dumb My restless discord loves no stops nor rests A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears Come Philomel that singst of ravishment Make thy sad grove in my disheveled hair As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment So I at each sad strain will strain a tear And with deep groans the diapason bear For burdenwise Ill hum on Tarquin still While thou on Tereus descants better skill And whiles against a thorn thou bearst thy part To keep thy sharp woes waking wretched I To imitate thee well against my heart Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye Who if it wink shall thereon fall and die These means as frets upon an instrument Shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment And for poor bird thou singst not in the day As shaming any eye should thee behold Some dark deep desert seated from the way That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold Will we find out and there we will unfold To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds Since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze Wildly determining which way to fly Or one encompassed with a winding maze That cannot tread the way out readily So with herself is she in mutiny To live or die which of the twain were better When life is shamed and Death reproachs debtor To kill myself quoth she alack what were it But with my body my poor souls pollution They that lose half with greater patience bear it Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion That mother tries a merciless conclusion Who having two sweet babes when death takes one Will slay the other and be nurse to none My body or my soul which was the dearer When the one pure the other made divine Whose love of either to myself was nearer When both were kept for heaven and Collatine Ay me the bark pilled from the lofty pine His leaves will wither and his sap decay So must my soul her bark being pilled away Her house is sacked her quiet interrupted Her mansion battered by the enemy Her sacred temple spotted spoiled corrupted Grossly engirt with daring infamy Then let it not be called impiety If in this blemished fort I make some hole Through which I may convey this troubled soul Yet die I will not till my Collatine Have heard the cause of my untimely death That he may vow in that sad hour of mine Revenge on him that made me stop my breath My stained blood to Tarquin Ill bequeath Which by him tainted shall for him be spent And as his due writ in my testament My honour Ill bequeath unto the knife That wounds my body so dishonoured Tis honour to deprive dishonoured life The one will live the other being dead So of shames ashes shall my fame be bred For in my death I murder shameful scorn My shame so dead mine honour is new born Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost What legacy shall I bequeath to thee My resolution love shall be thy boast By whose example thou revenged mayst be How Tarquin must be used read it in me Myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so This brief abridgement of my will I make My soul and body to the skies and ground My resolution husband do thou take Mine honour be the knifes that makes my wound My shame be his that did my fame confound And all my fame that lives disbursed be To those that live and think no shame of me Thou Collatine shalt oversee this will How was I overseen that thou shalt see it My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill My lifes foul deed my lifes fair end shall free it Faint not faint heart but stoutly say So be it Yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee Thou dead both die and both shall victors be This plot of death when sadly she had laid And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes With untuned tongue she hoarsely called her maid Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies For fleetwinged duty with thoughts feathers flies Poor Lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow Her mistress she doth give demure goodmorrow With soft slow tongue true mark of modesty And sorts a sad look to her ladys sorrow For why her face wore sorrows livery But durst not ask of her audaciously Why her two suns were cloudeclipsed so Nor why her fair cheeks overwashed with woe But as the earth doth weep the sun being set Each flower moistened like a melting eye Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet Her circled eyne enforced by sympathy Of those fair suns set in her mistress sky Who in a saltwaved ocean quench their light Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night A pretty while these pretty creatures stand Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling One justly weeps the other takes in hand No cause but company of her drops spilling Their gentle sex to weep are often willing Grieving themselves to guess at others smarts And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts For men have marble women waxen minds And therefore are they formed as marble will The weak oppressed th impression of strange kinds Is formed in them by force by fraud or skill Then call them not the authors of their ill No more than wax shall be accounted evil Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil Their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain Lays open all the little worms that creep In men as in a roughgrown grove remain Cavekeeping evils that obscurely sleep Through crystal walls each little mote will peep Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks Poor womens faces are their own faults books No man inveigh against the withered flower But chide rough winter that the flower hath killed Not that devoured but that which doth devour Is worthy blame O let it not be hild Poor womens faults that they are so fulfilled With mens abuses Those proud lords to blame Make weakmade women tenants to their shame The precedent whereof in Lucrece view Assailed by night with circumstances strong Of present death and shame that might ensue By that her death to do her husband wrong Such danger to resistance did belong The dying fear through all her body spread And who cannot abuse a body dead By this mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak To the poor counterfeit of her complaining My girl quoth she on what occasion break Those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining Know gentle wench it small avails my mood If tears could help mine own would do me good But tell me girl when wentand there she stayed Till after a deep groanTarquin from hence Madam ere I was up replied the maid The more to blame my sluggard negligence Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense Myself was stirring ere the break of day And ere I rose was Tarquin gone away But lady if your maid may be so bold She would request to know your heaviness O peace quoth Lucrece If it should be told The repetition cannot make it less For more it is than I can well express And that deep torture may be called a hell When more is felt than one hath power to tell Go get me hither paper ink and pen Yet save that labour for I have them here What should I sayOne of my husbands men Bid thou be ready by and by to bear A letter to my lord my love my dear Bid him with speed prepare to carry it The cause craves haste and it will soon be writ Her maid is gone and she prepares to write First hovering oer the paper with her quill Conceit and grief an eager combat fight What wit sets down is blotted straight with will This is too curiousgood this blunt and ill Much like a press of people at a door Throng her inventions which shall go before At last she thus begins Thou worthy lord Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee Health to thy person Next vouchsafe t affordIf ever love thy Lucrece thou wilt see Some present speed to come and visit me So I commend me from our house in grief My woes are tedious though my words are brief Here folds she up the tenor of her woe Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly By this short schedule Collatine may know Her grief but not her griefs true quality She dares not thereof make discovery Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse Besides the life and feeling of her passion She hoards to spend when he is by to hear her When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion Of her disgrace the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the world might bear her To shun this blot she would not blot the letter With words till action might become them better To see sad sights moves more than hear them told For then the eye interprets to the ear The heavy motion that it doth behold When every part a part of woe doth bear Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords And sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words Her letter now is sealed and on it writ At Ardea to my lord with more than haste The post attends and she delivers it Charging the sourfaced groom to hie as fast As lagging fowls before the northern blast Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems Extremely still urgeth such extremes The homely villain curtsies to her low And blushing on her with a steadfast eye Receives the scroll without or yea or no And forth with bashful innocence doth hie But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie Imagine every eye beholds their blame For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame When silly groom God wot it was defect Of spirit life and bold audacity Such harmless creatures have a true respect To talk in deeds while others saucily Promise more speed but do it leisurely Even so this pattern of the wornout age Pawned honest looks but laid no words to gage His kindled duty kindled her mistrust That two red fires in both their faces blazed She thought he blushed as knowing Tarquins lust And blushing with him wistly on him gazed Her earnest eye did make him more amazed The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish The more she thought he spied in her some blemish But long she thinks till he return again And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone The weary time she cannot entertain For now tis stale to sigh to weep to groan So woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan That she her plaints a little while doth stay Pausing for means to mourn some newer way At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of skilful painting made for Priams Troy Before the which is drawn the power of Greece For Helens rape the city to destroy Threatning cloudkissing Ilion with annoy Which the conceited painter drew so proud As heaven it seemed to kiss the turrets bowed A thousand lamentable objects there In scorn of Nature Art gave lifeless life Many a dry drop seemed a weeping tear Shed for the slaughtered husband by the wife The red blood reeked to show the painters strife The dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights There might you see the labouring pioneer Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust And from the towers of Troy there would appear The very eyes of men through loopholes thrust Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust Such sweet observance in this work was had That one might see those faroff eyes look sad In great commanders grace and majesty You might behold triumphing in their faces In youth quick bearing and dexterity And here and there the painter interlaces Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces Which heartless peasants did so well resemble That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble In Ajax and Ulysses O what art Of physiognomy might one behold The face of either ciphered eithers heart Their face their manners most expressly told In Ajax eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent Showed deep regard and smiling government There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand As twere encouraging the Greeks to fight Making such sober action with his hand That it beguiled attention charmed the sight In speech it seemed his beard all silver white Wagged up and down and from his lips did fly Thin winding breath which purled up to the sky About him were a press of gaping faces Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice All jointly listning but with several graces As if some mermaid did their ears entice Some high some low the painter was so nice The scalps of many almost hid behind To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind Here one mans hand leaned on anothers head His nose being shadowed by his neighbours ear Here one being thronged bears back all bolln and red Another smothered seems to pelt and swear And in their rage such signs of rage they bear As but for loss of Nestors golden words It seemed they would debate with angry swords For much imaginary work was there Conceit deceitful so compact so kind That for Achilles image stood his spear Griped in an armed hand himself behind Was left unseen save to the eye of mind A hand a foot a face a leg a head Stood for the whole to be imagined And from the walls of strongbesieged Troy When their brave hope bold Hector marched to field Stood many Trojan mothers sharing joy To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield And to their hope they such odd action yield That through their light joy seemed to appear Like bright things stained a kind of heavy fear And from the strand of Dardan where they fought To Simois reedy banks the red blood ran Whose waves to imitate the battle sought With swelling ridges and their ranks began To break upon the galled shore and then Retire again till meeting greater ranks They join and shoot their foam at Simois banks To this wellpainted piece is Lucrece come To find a face where all distress is stelled Many she sees where cares have carved some But none where all distress and dolour dwelled Till she despairing Hecuba beheld Staring on Priams wounds with her old eyes Which bleeding under Pyrrhus proud foot lies In her the painter had anatomized Times ruin beautys wrack and grim cares reign Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised Of what she was no semblance did remain Her blue blood changed to black in every vein Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed Showed life imprisoned in a body dead On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes And shapes her sorrow to the beldams woes Who nothing wants to answer her but cries And bitter words to ban her cruel foes The painter was no god to lend her those And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong To give her so much grief and not a tongue Poor instrument quoth she without a sound Ill tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue And drop sweet balm in Priams painted wound And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies Show me the strumpet that began this stir That with my nails her beauty I may tear Thy heat of lust fond Paris did incur This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here And here in Troy for trespass of thine eye The sire the son the dame and daughter die Why should the private pleasure of some one Become the public plague of many moe Let sin alone committed light alone Upon his head that hath transgressed so Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe For ones offence why should so many fall To plague a private sin in general Lo here weeps Hecuba here Priam dies Here manly Hector faints here Troilus swounds Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds And one mans lust these many lives confounds Had doting Priam checked his sons desire Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire Here feelingly she weeps Troys painted woes For sorrow like a heavyhanging bell Once set on ringing with his own weight goes Then little strength rings out the doleful knell So Lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow She lends them words and she their looks doth borrow She throws her eyes about the painting round And who she finds forlorn she doth lament At last she sees a wretched image bound That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent His face though full of cares yet showed content Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes So mild that patience seemed to scorn his woes In him the painter laboured with his skill To hide deceit and give the harmless show An humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe Cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so That blushing red no guilty instance gave Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have But like a constant and confirmed devil He entertained a show so seeming just And therein so ensconced his secret evil That jealousy itself could not mistrust Falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such blackfaced storms Or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms The wellskilled workman this mild image drew For perjured Sinon whose enchanting story The credulous Old Priam after slew Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory Of richbuilt Ilion that the skies were sorry And little stars shot from their fixed places When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces This picture she advisedly perused And chid the painter for his wondrous skill Saying some shape in Sinons was abused So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill And still on him she gazed and gazing still Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied That she concludes the picture was belied It cannot be quoth she that so much guile She would have said can lurk in such a look But Tarquins shape came in her mind the while And from her tongue can lurk from cannot took It cannot be she in that sense forsook And turned it thus It cannot be I find But such a face should bear a wicked mind For even as subtle Sinon here is painted So sobersad so weary and so mild As if with grief or travail he had fainted To me came Tarquin armed too beguiled With outward honesty but yet defiledWith inward vice As Priam him did cherish So did I Tarquin so my Troy did perish Look look how listening Priam wets his eyes To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds Priam why art thou old and yet not wise For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds His eye drops fire no water thence proceeds Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city Such devils steal effects from lightless hell For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold And in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell These contraries such unity do hold Only to flatter fools and make them bold So Priams trust false Sinons tears doth flatter That he finds means to burn his Troy with water Here all enraged such passion her assails That patience is quite beaten from her breast She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails Comparing him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself detest At last she smilingly with this gives oer Fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow And time doth weary time with her complaining She looks for night and then she longs for morrow And both she thinks too long with her remaining Short time seems long in sorrows sharp sustaining Though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps And they that watch see time how slow it creeps Which all this time hath overslipped her thought That she with painted images hath spent Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep surmise of others detriment Losing her woes in shows of discontent It easeth some though none it ever cured To think their dolour others have endured But now the mindful messenger come back Brings home his lord and other company Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black And round about her teardistained eye Blue circles streamed like rainbows in the sky These watergalls in her dim element Foretell new storms to those already spent Which when her sadbeholding husband saw Amazedly in her sad face he stares Her eyes though sod in tears looked red and raw Her lively colour killed with deadly cares He hath no power to ask her how she fares Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance Met far from home wondring each others chance At last he takes her by the bloodless hand And thus begins What uncouth ill event Hath thee befalln that thou dost trembling stand Sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent Why art thou thus attired in discontent Unmask dear dear this moody heaviness And tell thy grief that we may give redress Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire Ere once she can discharge one word of woe At length addressed to answer his desire She modestly prepares to let them know Her honour is taen prisoner by the foe While Collatine and his consorted lords With sad attention long to hear her words And now this pale swan in her watry nest Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending Few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best Where no excuse can give the fault amending In me more woes than words are now depending And my laments would be drawn out too long To tell them all with one poor tired tongue Then be this all the task it hath to say Dear husband in the interest of thy bed A stranger came and on that pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head And what wrong else may be imagined By foul enforcement might be done to me From that alas thy Lucrece is not free For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight With shining falchion in my chamber came A creeping creature with a flaming light And softly cried Awake thou Roman dame And entertain my love else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will inflict If thou my loves desire do contradict For some hardfavoured groom of thine quoth he Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will Ill murder straight and then Ill slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsome act of lust and so did kill The lechers in their deed This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy With this I did begin to start and cry And then against my heart he sets his sword Swearing unless I took all patiently I should not live to speak another word So should my shame still rest upon record And never be forgot in mighty Rome The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom Mine enemy was strong my poor self weak And far the weaker with so strong a fear My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak No rightful plea might plead for justice there His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies O teach me how to make mine own excuse Or at the least this refuge let me find Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse Immaculate and spotless is my mind That was not forced that never was inclined To accessary yieldings but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure Lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss With head declined and voice dammed up with woe With sad set eyes and wretched arms across From lips newwaxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so But wretched as he is he strives in vain What he breathes out his breath drinks up again As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast In rage sent out recalled in rage being past Even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw To push grief on and back the same grief draw Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh Dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth Another power no flood by raining slaketh My woe too sensible thy passion maketh More feelingpainful Let it then suffice To drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes And for my sake when I might charm thee so For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me Be suddenly revenged on my foe Thine mine his own Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late yet let the traitor die For sparing justice feeds iniquity But ere I name him you fair lords quoth she Speaking to those that came with Collatine Shall plight your honourable faiths to me With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine For tis a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms Knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms At this request with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid As bound in knighthood to her imposition Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed But she that yet her sad task hath not said The protestation stops O speak quoth she How may this forced stain be wiped from me What is the quality of my offence Being constrained with dreadful circumstance May my pure mind with the foul act dispense My lowdeclined honour to advance May any terms acquit me from this chance The poisoned fountain clears itself again And why not I from this compelled stain With this they all at once began to say Her bodys stain her mind untainted clears While with a joyless smile she turns away The face that map which deep impression bears Of hard misfortune carved in it with tears No no quoth she no dame hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuses giving Here with a sigh as if her heart would break She throws forth Tarquins name He he she says But more than he her poor tongue could not speak Till after many accents and delays Untimely breathings sick and short assays She utters this He he fair lords tis he That guides this hand to give this wound to me Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast A harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed That blow did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted prison where it breathed Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed Her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly Lifes lasting date from cancelled destiny Stonestill astonished with this deadly deed Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew Till Lucrece father that beholds her bleed Himself on her selfslaughtered body threw And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murdrous knife and as it left the place Her blood in poor revenge held it in chase And bubbling from her breast it doth divide In two slow rivers that the crimson blood Circles her body in on every side Who like a latesacked island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood Some of her blood still pure and red remained And some looked black and that false Tarquin stained About the mourning and congealed face Of that black blood a watry rigol goes Which seems to weep upon the tainted place And ever since as pitying Lucrece woes Corrupted blood some watery token shows And blood untainted still doth red abide Blushing at that which is so putrified Daughter dear daughter old Lucretius cries That life was mine which thou hast here deprived If in the child the fathers image lies Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived Thou wast not to this end from me derived If children predecease progenitors We are their offspring and they none of ours Poor broken glass I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born But now that fair fresh mirror dim and old Shows me a bareboned death by time outworn O from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn And shivered all the beauty of my glass That I no more can see what once I was O time cease thou thy course and last no longer If they surcease to be that should survive Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger And leave the faltring feeble souls alive The old bees die the young possess their hive Then live sweet Lucrece live again and see Thy father die and not thy father thee By this starts Collatine as from a dream And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place And then in keycold Lucrece bleeding stream He falls and bathes the pale fear in his face And counterfeits to die with her a space Till manly shame bids him possess his breath And live to be revenged on her death The deep vexation of his inward soul Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue Who mad that sorrow should his use control Or keep him from hearteasing words so long Begins to talk but through his lips do throng Weak words so thick come in his poor hearts aid That no man could distinguish what he said Yet sometime Tarquin was pronounced plain But through his teeth as if the name he toreThis windy tempest till it blow up rain Held back his sorrows tide to make it more At last it rains and busy winds give oer Then son and father weep with equal strife Who should weep most for daughter or for wife The one doth call her his the other his Yet neither may possess the claim they lay The father says Shes mine O mine she is Replies her husband Do not take away My sorrows interest let no mourner say He weeps for her for she was only mine And only must be wailed by Collatine O quoth Lucretius I did give that life Which she too early and too late hath spilled Woe woe quoth Collatine she was my wife I owed her and tis mine that she hath killed My daughter and my wife with clamours filled The dispersed air who holding Lucrece life Answered their cries my daughter and my wife Brutus who plucked the knife from Lucrece side Seeing such emulation in their woe Began to clothe his wit in state and pride Burying in Lucrece wound his follys show He with the Romans was esteemed so As silly jeering idiots are with kings For sportive words and uttring foolish things But now he throws that shallow habit by Wherein deep policy did him disguise And armed his longhid wits advisedly To check the tears in Collatinus eyes Thou wronged lord of Rome quoth he arise Let my unsounded self supposed a fool Now set thy longexperienced wit to school Why Collatine is woe the cure for woe Do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds Is it revenge to give thyself a blow For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so To slay herself that should have slain her foe Courageous Roman do not steep thy heart In such relenting dew of lamentations But kneel with me and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with invocations That they will suffer these abominations Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased Now by the Capitol that we adore And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained By heavens fair sun that breeds"

Amiens and Lords as outlaws DUKE SENIOR I think he be transformed into a beast For I can nowhere find him like a man FIRST LORD My lord he is but even now gone hence Here was he merry hearing of a song DUKE SENIOR If he compact of jars grow musical We shall have shortly discord in the spheres Go seek him tell him I would speak with him Enter Jaques FIRST LORD He saves my labour by his own approach DUKE SENIOR Why how now monsieur What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company What you look merrily JAQUES A fool a fool I met a fool i th forest A motley fool A miserable world As I do live by food I met a fool Who laid him down and basked him in the sun And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms In good set terms and yet a motley fool Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune And then he drew a dial from his poke And looking on it with lacklustre eye Says very wisely It is ten oclock Thus we may see quoth he how the world wags Tis but an hour ago since it was nine And after one hour more twill be eleven And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe And then from hour to hour we rot and rot And thereby hangs a tale When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time My lungs began to crow like chanticleer That fools should be so deepcontemplative And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial O noble fool A worthy fool Motleys the only wear DUKE SENIOR What fool is this JAQUES O worthy foolOne that hath been a courtier And says if ladies be but young and fair They have the gift to know it And in his brain Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage he hath strange places crammed With observation the which he vents In mangled forms O that I were a fool I am ambitious for a motley coat DUKE SENIOR Thou shalt have one JAQUES It is my only suit Provided that you weed your better judgements Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise I must have liberty Withal as large a charter as the wind To blow on whom I please for so fools have And they that are most galled with my folly They most must laugh And why sir must they so The why is plain as way to parish churchHe that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly although he smart Not to seem senseless of the bob If not The wise mans folly is anatomized Even by the squandering glances of the fool Invest me in my motley Give me leave To speak my mind and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th infected world If they will patiently receive my medicine DUKE SENIOR Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do JAQUES What for a counter would I do but good DUKE SENIOR Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin For thou thyself hast been a libertine As sensual as the brutish sting itself And all th embossed sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world JAQUES Why who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea Till that the weary very means do ebb What woman in the city do I name When that I say the citywoman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders Who can come in and say that I mean her When such a one as she such is her neighbour Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not on my cost Thinking that I mean him but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech There then How then what then Let me see wherein My tongue hath wronged him If it do him right Then he hath wronged himself If he be free Why then my

gentleness ORLANDO I almost die for food and let me have it DUKE SENIOR Sit down and feed and welcome to our table ORLANDO Speak you so gently Pardon me I pray you I thought that all things had been savage here And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment But whateer you are That in this desert inaccessible Under the shade of melancholy boughs Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have looked on better days If ever been where bells have knolled to church If ever sat at any good mans feast If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear And know what tis to pity and be pitied Let gentleness my strong enforcement be In the which hope I blush and hide my sword DUKE SENIOR True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church And sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be ministered ORLANDO Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn And give it food There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love Till he be first sufficed Oppressed with two weak evils age and hunger I will not touch a bit DUKE SENIOR Go find him out And we will nothing waste till you return ORLANDO I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort Exit DUKE SENIOR Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in JAQUES All the worlds a stage And all the men and women merely players They have their exits and their entrances And one man in his time plays many parts His acts being seven ages At first the infant Mewling and puking in the nurses arms Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face creeping like snail Unwillingly to school And then the lover Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice In fair round belly with good capon lined With eyes severe and beard of formal cut Full of wise saws and modern instances And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon With spectacles on nose and pouch on side His youthful hose well saved a world too wide For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice Turning again toward childish treble pipes And whistles in his sound Last scene of all That ends this strange eventful history Is second childishness and mere oblivion Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything Enter Orlando bearing Adam DUKE SENIOR Welcome Set down your venerable burden And let him feed ORLANDO I thank you most for him ADAM So had you need I scarce can speak to thank you for myself DUKE SENIOR Welcome fall to I will not trouble you As yet

thou bitter sky That dost not bite so nigh As benefits forgot Though thou the waters warp Thy sting is not so sharp As friend remembered not Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly Most friendship

everywhere Run run Orlando carve on every tree The fair the chaste and unexpressive she Exit Enter Corin and Touchstone CORIN And how like you this shepherds life Master Touchstone TOUCHSTONE Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherds life it is naught In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd CORIN No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred TOUCHSTONE Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in court shepherd CORIN No truly TOUCHSTONE Then thou art damned CORIN Nay I hope TOUCHSTONE Truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all on one side CORIN For not being at court Your reason TOUCHSTONE Why if thou never wast at court thou never sawst good manners if thou never sawst good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous state shepherd CORIN Not a whit Touchstone Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds TOUCHSTONE Instance briefly Come instance CORIN Why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasy TOUCHSTONE Why do not your courtiers hands sweat And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow shallow A better instance I say Come CORIN Besides our hands are hard TOUCHSTONE Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again A more sounder instance come CORIN And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The courtiers hands are perfumed with civet TOUCHSTONE Most shallow man Thou worms meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend Civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the

earn that I eat get that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck TOUCHSTONE That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a twelvemonth to crookedpated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match If thou best not damned for this the devil himself will have no shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape Enter

Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock ORLANDO And why not the swift foot of time Had not that been as proper ROSALIND By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with divers persons Ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal ORLANDO I prithee who doth he trot withal ROSALIND Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized If the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year ORLANDO Who ambles time withal ROSALIND With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These time ambles withal ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal ROSALIND With a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there ORLANDO Who stays it still withal ROSALIND With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves ORLANDO Where dwell you pretty youth ROSALIND With this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat ORLANDO Are you native of this place ROSALIND As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindledORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling ROSALIND I have been told so of many But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ROSALIND There were none principal They were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it ORLANDO I prithee recount some of them ROSALIND No I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind If I could meet that fancymonger I would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him ORLANDO I am he that is so loveshaked I pray you tell me your remedy ROSALIND There is none of my uncles marks upon you He taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner ORLANDO What were his marks ROSALIND A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have notbut I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue Then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man You are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other ORLANDO Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love ROSALIND Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired ORLANDO I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much ROSALIND Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so ROSALIND Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic And thus I cured him and this way will I take"

my loves desire do contradict For some hardfavoured groom of thine quoth he Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will Ill murder straight and then Ill slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsome act of lust and so did kill The lechers in their deed This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy With this I did begin to start and cry And then against my heart he sets his sword Swearing unless I took all patiently I should not live to speak another word So should my shame still rest upon record And never be forgot in mighty Rome The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom Mine enemy was strong my poor self weak And far the weaker with so strong a fear My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak No rightful plea might plead for justice there His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies O teach me how to make mine own excuse Or at the least this refuge let me find Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse Immaculate and spotless is my mind That was not forced that never was inclined To accessary yieldings but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure Lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss With head declined and voice dammed up with woe With sad set eyes and wretched arms across From lips newwaxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so But wretched as he is he strives in vain What he breathes out his breath drinks up again As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast In rage sent out recalled in rage being past Even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw To push grief on and back the same grief draw Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh Dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth Another power no flood by raining slaketh My woe too sensible thy passion maketh More feelingpainful Let it then suffice To drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes And for my sake when I might charm thee so For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me Be suddenly revenged on my foe Thine mine his own Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late yet let the traitor die For sparing justice feeds iniquity But ere I name him you fair lords quoth she Speaking to those that came with Collatine Shall plight your honourable faiths to me With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine For tis a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms Knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms At this request with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid As bound in knighthood to her imposition Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed But she that yet her sad task hath not said The protestation stops O speak quoth she How may this forced stain be wiped from me What is the quality of my offence Being constrained with dreadful circumstance May my pure mind with the foul act dispense My lowdeclined honour to advance May any terms acquit me from this chance The poisoned fountain clears itself again And why not I from this compelled stain With this they all at once began to say Her bodys stain her mind untainted clears While with a joyless smile she turns away The face that map which deep impression bears Of hard misfortune carved in it with tears No no quoth she no dame hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuses giving Here with a sigh as if her heart would break She throws forth Tarquins name He he she says But more than he her poor tongue could not speak Till after many accents and delays Untimely breathings sick and short assays She utters this He he fair lords tis he That guides this hand to give this wound to me Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast A harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed That blow did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted prison where it breathed Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed Her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly Lifes lasting date from cancelled destiny Stonestill astonished with this deadly deed Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew Till Lucrece father that beholds her bleed Himself on her selfslaughtered body threw And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murdrous knife and as it left the place Her blood in poor revenge held it in chase And bubbling from her breast it doth divide In two slow rivers that the crimson blood Circles her body in on every side Who like a latesacked island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood Some of her blood still pure and red remained And some looked black and that false Tarquin stained About the mourning and congealed face Of that black blood a watry rigol goes Which seems to weep upon the tainted place And ever since as pitying Lucrece woes Corrupted blood some watery token shows And blood untainted still doth red abide Blushing at that which is so putrified Daughter dear daughter old Lucretius cries That life was mine which thou hast here deprived If in the child the fathers image lies Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived Thou wast not to this end from me derived If children predecease progenitors We are their offspring and they none of ours Poor broken glass I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born But now that fair fresh mirror dim and old Shows me a bareboned death by time outworn O from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn And shivered all the beauty of my glass That I no more can see what once I was O time cease thou thy course and last no longer If they surcease to be that should survive Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger And leave the faltring feeble souls alive The old bees die the young possess their hive Then live sweet Lucrece live again and see Thy father die and not thy father thee By this starts Collatine as from a dream And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place And then in keycold Lucrece bleeding stream He falls and bathes the pale fear in his face And counterfeits to die with her a space Till manly shame bids him possess his breath And live to be revenged on her death The deep vexation of his inward soul Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue Who mad that sorrow should his use control Or keep him from hearteasing words so long Begins to talk but through his lips do throng Weak words so thick come in his poor hearts aid That no man could distinguish what he said Yet sometime Tarquin was pronounced plain But through his teeth as if the name he toreThis windy tempest till it blow up rain Held back his sorrows tide to make it more At last it rains and busy winds give oer Then son and father weep with equal strife Who should weep most for daughter or for wife The one doth call her his the other his Yet neither may possess the claim they lay The father says Shes mine O mine she is Replies her husband Do not take away My sorrows interest let no mourner say He weeps for her for she was only mine And only must be wailed by Collatine O quoth Lucretius I did give that life Which she too early and too late hath spilled Woe woe quoth Collatine she was my wife I owed her and tis mine that she hath killed My daughter and my wife with clamours filled The dispersed air who holding Lucrece life Answered their cries my daughter and my wife Brutus who plucked the knife from Lucrece side Seeing such emulation in their woe Began to clothe his wit in state and pride Burying in Lucrece wound his follys show He with the Romans was esteemed so As silly jeering idiots are with kings For sportive words and uttring foolish things But now he throws that shallow habit by Wherein deep policy did him disguise And armed his longhid wits advisedly To check the tears in Collatinus eyes Thou wronged lord of Rome quoth he arise Let my unsounded self supposed a fool Now set thy longexperienced wit to school Why Collatine is woe the cure for woe Do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds Is it revenge to give thyself a blow For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so To slay herself that should have slain her foe Courageous Roman do not steep thy heart In such relenting dew of lamentations But kneel with me and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with invocations That they will suffer these abominations Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased Now by the Capitol that we adore And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained By heavens fair sun that breeds the fat earths store By all our country rights in Rome maintained And by chaste Lucrece soul that late complained Her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife We will revenge the death of this true wife This said he struck his hand upon his breast And kissed the fatal knife to end his vow And to his protestation urged the rest Who wondring at him did his words allow Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow And that deep vow which Brutus made before He doth again repeat and that they swore When they had sworn to this advised doom They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence To show her bleeding body thorough Rome And so to publish Tarquins foul offence Which being done with speedy diligence The Romans plausibly did give consent To Tarquins everlasting banishment VENUS AND ADONIS Vilia miretur vulgus mihi flavus Apollo Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON and Baron of Titchfield Right Honourable I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your lordship nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen only if your honour seem but pleased I account myself highly praised and vow to take advantage of all idle hours till I have honoured you with some graver labour But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather and never after ear so barren a land for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest I leave it to your honourable survey and your honour to your hearts content which I wish may always answer your own wish and the worlds hopeful expectation Your honours in all duty WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE VENUS AND ADONIS Even as the sun with purplecolourd face Had taen his last leave of the weeping morn Rosecheekd Adonis hied him to the chase Hunting he lovd but love he laughd to scorn 4 Sickthoughted Venus makes amain unto him And like a boldfacd suitor gins to woo him Thrice fairer than myself thus she began The fields chief flower sweet above compare 8 Stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man More white and red than doves or roses are Nature that made thee with herself at strife Saith that the world hath ending with thy life 12 Vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed And rein his proud head to the saddlebow If thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know 16 Here come and sit where never serpent hisses And being set Ill smother thee with kisses And yet not cloy thy lips with loathd satiety But rather famish them amid their plenty 20 Making them red and pale with fresh variety Ten kisses short as one one long as twenty A summers day will seem an hour but short Being wasted in such timebeguiling sport 24 With this she seizeth on his sweating palm The precedent of pith and livelihood And trembling in her passion calls it balm Earths sovereign salve to do a goddess good 28 Being so enragd desire doth lend her force Courageously to pluck him from his horse Over one arm the lusty coursers rein Under her other was the tender boy 32 Who blushd and pouted in a dull disdain With leaden appetite unapt to toy She red and hot as coals of glowing fire He red for shame but frosty in desire 36 The studded bridle on a ragged bough Nimbly she fastensO how quick is love The steed is stalled up and even now To tie the rider she begins to prove 40 Backward she pushd him as she would be thrust And governd him in strength though not in lust So soon was she along as he was down Each leaning on their elbows and their hips 44 Now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown And gins to chide but soon she stops his lips And kissing speaks with lustful language broken If thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open 48 He burns with bashful shame she with her tears Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs To fan and blow them dry again she seeks 52 He saith she is immodest blames her miss What follows more she murders with a kiss Even as an empty eagle sharp by fast Tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone 56 Shaking her wings devouring all in haste Till either gorge be stuffd or prey be gone Even so she kissd his brow his cheek his chin And where she ends she doth anew begin 60 Forcd to content but never to obey Panting he lies and breatheth in her face She feedeth on the steam as on a prey And calls it heavenly moisture air of grace 64 Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers So they were dewd with such distilling showers Look how a bird lies tangled in a net So fastend in her arms Adonis lies 68 Pure shame and awd resistance made him fret Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes Rain added to a river that is rank Perforce will force it overflow the bank 72 Still she entreats and prettily entreats For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale Still is he sullen still he lours and frets Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale 76 Being red she loves him best and being white Her best is betterd with a more delight Look how he can she cannot choose but love And by her fair immortal hand she swears 80 From his soft bosom never to remove Till he take truce with her contending tears Which long have raind making her cheeks all wet And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt Upon this promise did he raise his chin 85 Like a divedapper peering through a wave Who being lookd on ducks as quickly in So offers he to give what she did crave 88 But when her lips were ready for his pay He winks and turns his lips another way Never did passenger in summers heat More thirst for drink than she for this good turn 92 Her help she sees but help she cannot get She bathes in water yet her fire must burn O pity gan she cry flinthearted boy Tis but a kiss I beg why art thou coy 96 I have been wood as I entreat thee now Even by the stern and direful god of war Whose sinewy neck in battle neer did bow Who conquers where he comes in every jar 100 Yet hath he been my captive and my slave And beggd for that which thou unaskd shalt have Over my altars hath he hung his lance His batterd shield his uncontrolled crest 104 And for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance To toy to wanton dally smile and jest Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red Making my arms his field his tent my bed 108 Thus he that overruld I overswayd Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain Strongtemperd steel his stronger strength obeyd Yet was he servile to my coy disdain 112 Oh be not proud nor brag not of thy might For mastring her that foild the god of fight Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine Though mine be not so fair yet are they red 116 The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine What seest thou in the ground hold up thy head Look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies Then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes 120 Art thou ashamd to kiss then wink again And I will wink so shall the day seem night Love keeps his revels where there are but twain Be bold to play our sport is not in sight 124 These blueveind violets whereon we lean Never can blab nor know not what we mean The tender spring upon thy tempting lip 127 Shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted Make use of time let not advantage slip Beauty within itself should not be wasted Fair flowers that are not gatherd in their prime Rot and consume themselves in little time 132 Were I hardfavourd foul or wrinkled old Illnurturd crooked churlish harsh in voice Oerworn despised rheumatic and cold Thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice 136 Then mightst thou pause for then I were not for thee But having no defects why dost abhor me Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow 139 Mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow My flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning My smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt Would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt 144 Bid me discourse I will enchant thine ear Or like a fairy trip upon the green Or like a nymph with long dishevelld hair Dance on the sands and yet no footing seen 148 Love is a spirit all compact of fire Not gross to sink but light and will aspire Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie 151These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky From morn till night even where I list to sport me Is love so light sweet boy and may it be That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee 156 Is thine own heart to thine own face affected Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left Then woo thyself be of thyself rejected Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft 160 Narcissus so himself himself forsook And died to kiss his shadow in the brook Torches are made to light jewels to wear Dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use 164 Herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear Things growing to themselves are growths abuse Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty Thou wast begot to get it is thy duty 168 Upon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed Unless the earth with thy increase be fed By law of nature thou art bound to breed That thine may live when thou thyself art dead 172 And so in spite of death thou dost survive In that thy likeness still is left alive By this the lovesick queen began to sweat For where they lay the shadow had forsook them 176 And Titan tired in the midday heat With burning eye did hotly overlook them Wishing Adonis had his team to guide So he were like him and by Venus side 180 And now Adonis with a lazy spright And with a heavy dark disliking eye His louring brows oerwhelming his fair sight Like misty vapours when they blot the sky 184 Souring his cheeks cries Fie no more of love The sun doth burn my face I must remove Ay me quoth Venus young and so unkind What bare excuses makst thou to be gone 188 Ill sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind Shall cool the heat of this descending sun Ill make a shadow for thee of my hairs If they burn too Ill quench them with my tears 192 The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm And lo I lie between that sun and thee The heat I have from thence doth little harm Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me 196 And were I not immortal life were done Between this heavenly and earthly sun Art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel Nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth 200 Art thou a womans son and canst not feel What tis to love how want of love tormenteth O had thy mother borne so hard a mind She had not brought forth thee but died unkind 204 What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this Or what great danger dwells upon my suit What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss Speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute 208 Give me one kiss Ill give it thee again And one for intrest if thou wilt have twain Fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone Wellpainted idol image dull and dead 212 Statue contenting but the eye alone Thing like a man but of no woman bred Thou art no man though of a mans complexion For men will kiss even by their own direction 216 This said impatience chokes her pleading tongue And swelling passion doth provoke a pause Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong Being judge in love she cannot right her cause 220 And now she weeps and now she fain would speak And now her sobs do her intendments break Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand Now gazeth she on him now on the ground 224 Sometimes her arms infold him like a band She would he will not in her arms be bound And when from thence he struggles to be gone She locks her lily fingers one in one 228 Fondling she saith since I have hemmd thee here Within the circuit of this ivory pale Ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer Feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 232 Graze on my lips and if those hills be dry Stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie Within this limit is relief enough Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain 236 Round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough To shelter thee from tempest and from rain Then be my deer since I am such a park 239 No dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark At this Adonis smiles as in disdain That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple Love made those hollows if himself were slain He might be buried in a tomb so simple 244 Foreknowing well if there he came to lie Why there love livd and there he could not die These lovely caves these round enchanting pits Opend their mouths to swallow Venus liking 248 Being mad before how doth she now for wits Struck dead at first what needs a second striking Poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn 252 Now which way shall she turn what shall she say Her words are done her woes the more increasing The time is spent her object will away And from her twining arms doth urge releasing 256 Pity she cries some favour some remorse Away he springs and hasteth to his horse But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by A breeding jennet lusty young and proud 260 Adonis tramping courser doth espy And forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud The strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he 264 Imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds And now his woven girths he breaks asunder The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds Whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder The iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth 269 Controlling what he was controlled with His ears upprickd his braided hanging mane Upon his compassd crest now stand on end 272 His nostrils drink the air and forth again As from a furnace vapours doth he send His eye which scornfully glisters like fire Shows his hot courage and his high desire 276 Sometime he trots as if he told the steps With gentle majesty and modest pride Anon he rears upright curvets and leaps As who should say Lo thus my strength is tried And this I do to captivate the eye 281 Of the fair breeder that is standing by What recketh he his riders angry stir His flattering Holla or his Stand I say 284 What cares he now for curb or pricking spur For rich caparisons or trappings gay He sees his love and nothing else he sees For nothing else with his proud sight agrees 288 Look when a painter would surpass the life In limning out a wellproportiond steed His art with natures workmanship at strife As if the dead the living should exceed 292 So did this horse excel a common one In shape in courage colour pace and bone Roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long Broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide Look what a horse should have he did not lack Save a proud rider on so proud a back 300 Sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares Anon he starts at stirring of a feather To bid the wind a base he now prepares And where he run or fly they know not whether 304 For through his mane and tail the high wind sings Fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings He looks upon his love and neighs unto her She answers him as if she knew his mind 308 Being proud as females are to see him woo her She puts on outward strangeness seems unkind Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels Beating his kind embracements with her heels 312 Then like a melancholy malcontent He vails his tail that like a falling plume Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 316 His love perceiving how he was enragd Grew kinder and his fury was assuagd His testy master goeth about to take him When lo the unbackd breeder full of fear 320 Jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him With her the horse and left Adonis there As they were mad unto the wood they hie them Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them 324 All swoln with chafing down Adonis sits Banning his boisterous and unruly beast And now the happy season once more fits That lovesick love by pleading may be blest 328 For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong When it is barrd the aidance of the tongue An oven that is stoppd or river stayd Burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 332 So of concealed sorrow may be said Free vent of words loves fire doth assuage But when the hearts attorney once is mute The client breaks as desperate in his suit 336 He sees her coming and begins to glow Even as a dying coal revives with wind And with his bonnet hides his angry brow Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 340 Taking no notice that she is so nigh For all askance he holds her in his eye O what a sight it was wistly to view How she came stealing to the wayward boy 344 To note the fighting conflict of her hue How white and red each other did destroy But now her cheek was pale and by and by It flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky 348 Now was she just before him as he sat And like a lowly lover down she kneels With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 352 His tendrer cheek receives her soft hands print As apt as newfalln snow takes any dint Oh what a war of looks was then between them Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 356 His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them Her eyes wood still his eyes disdaind the wooing And all this dumb play had his acts made plain With tears which choruslike her eyes did rain Full gently now she takes him by the hand 361 A lily prisond in a gaol of snow Or ivory in an alabaster band So white a friend engirts so white a foe 364 This beauteous combat wilful and unwilling Showd like two silver doves that sit abilling Once more the engine of her thoughts began O fairest mover on this mortal round 368 Would thou wert as I am and I a man My heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee Though nothing but my bodys bane would cure thee Give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it Give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it And being steeld soft sighs can never grave it 376 Then loves deep groans I never shall regard Because Adonis heart hath made mine hard For shame he cries let go and let me go My days delight is past my horse is gone 380 And tis your fault I am bereft him so I pray you hence and leave me here alone For all my mind my thought my busy care Is how to get my palfrey from the mare 384 Thus she replies Thy palfrey as he should Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desireAffection is a coal that must be coold Else sufferd it will set the heart on fire 388 The sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone How like a jade he stood tied to the tree Servilely masterd with a leathern rein 392 But when he saw his love his youths fair fee He held such petty bondage in disdain Throwing the base thong from his bending crest Enfranchising his mouth his back his breast 396 Who sees his truelove in her naked bed Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white But when his glutton eye so full hath fed His other agents aim at like delight 400 Who is so faint that dare not be so bold To touch the fire the weather being cold Let me excuse thy courser gentle boy And learn of him I heartily beseech thee 404 To take advantage on presented joy Though I were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee O learn to love the lesson is but plain And once made perfect never lost again 408 I know not love quoth he nor will not know it Unless it be a boar and then I chase it Tis much to borrow and I will not owe it My love to love is love but to disgrace it 412 For I have heard it is a life in death That laughs and weeps and all but with a breath Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinishd Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth 416 If springing things be any jot diminishd They wither in their prime prove nothing worth The colt thats backd and burdend being young Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong 420 You hurt my hand with wringing Let us part And leave this idle theme this bootless chat Remove your siege from my unyielding heart To loves alarms it will not ope the gate 424 Dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattry For where a heart is hard they make no battry What canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue O would thou hadst not or I had no hearing 428 Thy mermaids voice hath done me double wrong I had my load before now pressd with bearing Melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding Ears deep sweet music and hearts deep sore wounding Had I no eyes but ears my ears would love 433 That inward beauty and invisible Or were I deaf thy outward parts would move Each part in me that were but sensible 436 Though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see Yet should I be in love by touching thee Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me And that I could not see nor hear nor touch 440 And nothing but the very smell were left me Yet would my love to thee be still as much For from the stillitory of thy face excelling Comes breath perfumd that breedeth love by smelling But oh what banquet wert thou to the taste 445 Being nurse and feeder of the other four Would they not wish the feast might ever last And bid suspicion doublelock the door Lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest Should by his stealing in disturb the feast 448 Once more the rubycolourd portal opend Which to his speech did honey passage yield 452 Like a red morn that ever yet betokend Wrack to the seaman tempest to the field Sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds 456 This ill presage advisedly she marketh Even as the wind is hushd before it raineth Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh Or as the berry breaks before it staineth 460 Or like the deadly bullet of a gun His meaning struck her ere his words begun And at his look she flatly falleth down For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth 464 A smile recures the wounding of a frown But blessed bankrout that by love so thriveth The silly boy believing she is dead Claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red 468 And all amazd brake off his late intent For sharply he did think to reprehend her Which cunning love did wittily prevent Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her 472 For on the grass she lies as she were slain Till his breath breatheth life in her again He wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks He bends her fingers holds her pulses hard 476 He chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks To mend the hurt that his unkindness marrd He kisses her and she by her good will Will never rise so he will kiss her still 480 The night of sorrow now is turnd to day Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth Like the fair sun when in his fresh array He cheers the morn and all the world relieveth 484 And as the bright sun glorifies the sky So is her face illumind with her eye Whose beams upon his hairless face are fixd As if from thence they borrowd all their shine 488 Were never four such lamps together mixd Had not his clouded with his brows repine But hers which through the crystal tears gave light Shone like the moon in water seen by night 492 O where am I quoth she in earth or heaven Or in the ocean drenchd or in the fire What hour is this or morn or weary even Do I delight to die or life desire 496 But now I livd and life was deaths annoy But now I died and death was lively joy O thou didst kill me kill me once again Thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine 500 Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain That they have murderd this poor heart of mine And these mine eyes true leaders to their queen But for thy piteous lips no more had seen 504 Long may they kiss each other for this cure Oh never let their crimson liveries wear And as they last their verdure still endure To drive infection from the dangerous year 508 That the stargazers having writ on death May say the plague is banishd by thy breath Pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted What bargains may I make still to be sealing 512 To sell myself I can be well contented So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing Which purchase if thou make for fear of slips Set thy seal manual on my waxred lips 516 A thousand kisses buys my heart from me And pay them at thy leisure one by one What is ten hundred touches unto thee Are they not quickly told and quickly gone 520 Say for nonpayment that the debt should double Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble Fair queen quoth he if any love you owe me Measure my strangeness with my unripe years 524 Before I know myself seek not to know me No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears The mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast Or being early pluckd is sour to taste 528 Look the worlds comforter with weary gait His days hot task hath ended in the west The owl nights herald shrieks tis very late The sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest 532 And coalblack clouds that shadow heavens light Do summon us to part and bid good night Now let me say good night and so say you If you will say so you shall have a kiss 536 Good night quoth she and ere he says adieu The honey fee of parting tenderd is Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace Incorporate then they seem face grows to face 540 Till breathless he disjoind and backward drew The heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew Whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth 544 He with her plenty pressd she faint with dearth Their lips together glued fall to the earth Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey And gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth 548 Her lips are conquerors his lips obey Paying what ransom the insulter willeth Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high That she will draw his lips rich treasure dry 552 And having felt the sweetness of the spoil With blindfold fury she begins to forage Her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage 556 Planting oblivion beating reason back Forgetting shames pure blush and honours wrack Hot faint and weary with her hard embracing Like a wild bird being tamd with too much handling Or as the fleetfoot roe thats tird with chasing 56"

of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame Martius for being proud BRUTUS We do it not alone sir MENENIUS I know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single Your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone You talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O that you could BOTH TRIBUNES What then sir MENENIUS Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in Rome SICINIUS Menenius you are known well enough too MENENIUS I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial

call you Lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I cannot say your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the

microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough too BRUTUS Come sir come we know you well enough MENENIUS You know neither me yourselves nor anything You are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and a faucetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves You are a pair of strange ones BRUTUS Come come You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss packsaddle Yet you must be saying Martius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though

rather be their servant in my way Than sway with them in theirs COMINIUS On to the Capitol Flourish of cornets Exeunt in state as before Brutus and Sicinius come forward BRUTUS All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights Are spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse Into a rapture lets her baby cry While she chats him The kitchen malkin pins Her richest lockram bout her reechy neck Clambring the walls to eye him Stalls bulks windows Are smothered up leads filled and ridges horsed With variable complexions all agreeing In earnestness to see him Seldshown flamens Do press among the popular throngs and puff To win a vulgar station Our veiled dames Commit the war of white and damask in Their nicelygauded cheeks to th wanton spoil Of Phoebus burning kisses Such a pother As if that whatsoever god who leads him Were slyly crept into his human powers And gave him graceful posture SICINIUS On the sudden I warrant him consul BRUTUS Then our office may During his power go sleep SICINIUS He cannot temprately transport his honours From where he should begin and end but will Lose those he hath won BRUTUS In that theres comfort SICINIUS Doubt not the commoners for whom we stand But they upon their ancient malice will forget With the least cause these his new honourswhich That he will give them make as little question As he is proud to dot BRUTUS I heard him swear Were he to stand for consul never would he Appear i th marketplace nor on him put The napless vesture of humility Nor showing as the manner is his wounds To th people beg their stinking breaths SICINIUS Tis right BRUTUS It was his word O he would miss it ratherThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him And the desire of the nobles SICINIUS I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution BRUTUS Tis most like he will SICINIUS It shall be to him then as our good wills A sure destruction BRUTUS So it must fall out To him or our authorities for an end We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them that tos power he would Have made them mules silenced their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms holding them In human action and capacity Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in their war who have their provand Only for bearing burdens and sore blows For sinking under them SICINIUS This as you say suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want If it be put upont and thats as easy As to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever Enter a Messenger BRUTUS Whats the matter MESSENGER You are sent for to the Capitol Tis thought That Martius shall be consul I have seen The dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs Upon him as he passed the nobles bended As to Joves statue and the Commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like BRUTUS Lets to the Capitol And carry with us ears and eyes for th time But hearts for the event SICINIUS Have with you Exeunt SCENE II Rome The Capitol Enter two Officers to lay cushions as it were in the Capitol FIRST OFFICER Come come They are almost here How many stand for consulships SECOND OFFICER Three they say but tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it FIRST OFFICER Thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury To report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it FIRST OFFICER No more of him hes a worthy man Make way They are coming A sennet Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the people Lictors before them Coriolanus Menenius Cominius the consul The Patricians sit Sicinius and Brutus take their places by themselves Coriolanus stands MENENIUS Having determined of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius it remains As the main point of this our aftermeeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our wellfound successes to report A little of that worthy work performed By Martius Caius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself Coriolanus sits FIRST SENATOR Speak good Cominius Leave nothing out for length and make us think Rather our states defective for requital Than we to stretch it out Masters o th people We do request your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here SICINIUS We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly BRUTUS Which the rather We shall be blest to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at MENENIUS Thats off thats off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speak BRUTUS Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it MENENIUS He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speak Coriolanus rises and offers to go away Nay keep your place FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear What you have nobly done CORIOLANUS Your Honours pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them BRUTUS Sir I hope My words disbenched you not CORIOLANUS No sir Yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You soothed not therefore hurt not but your people I love them as they weigh MENENIUS Pray now sit down CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered Exit MENENIUS Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one ons ears to hear itProceed Cominius COMINIUS I shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver if it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him He bestrid An oerpressed Roman and i th Consuls view Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met And struck him on his knee In that days feats When he might act the woman in the scene He proved best man i th field and for his meed Was browbound with the oak His pupil age Manentered thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurched all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioles let me say I cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport As weeds before A vessel under sail so men obeyed And fell below his stem His sword Deaths stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was timed with dying cries Alone he entered The mortal gate o th city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioles like a planet Now alls his When by and by the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Requickened what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking oer the lives of men as if Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting MENENIUS Worthy man FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at And looked upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it MENENIUS Hes right noble Let him be called for FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus OFFICER He doth appear Enter Coriolanus MENENIUS The Senate Coriolanus are well pleased To make thee consul CORIOLANUS I do owe them still My life and services MENENIUS It then remains That you do speak to the people CORIOLANUS I do beseech you Let me oerleap that custom for I cannot Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds sake to give their suffrage Please you That I may pass this doing SICINIUS Sir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony MENENIUS Put them not tot Pray you go fit you to the custom and Take to you as your predecessors have Your honour with your form CORIOLANUS It is a part That I shall blush in acting and might well Be taken from the people BRUTUS Mark you that CORIOLANUS To brag unto them thus I did and thus Show them th unaching scars which I should hide As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only MENENIUS Do not stand upont We recommend to you tribunes of the people Our purpose to them and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour SENATORS To Coriolanus come all joy and honour Flourish cornets Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus BRUTUS You see how he intends to use the people SICINIUS May they perceives intent He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give BRUTUS Come well inform them Of our proceedings here On th marketplace I know they do attend us Exeunt SCENE III Rome The Forum Enter seven or eight Citizens FIRST CITIZEN Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him SECOND CITIZEN We may sir if we will THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them So if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude THIRD CITIZEN We have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o th compass SECOND CITIZEN Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would flyTHIRD CITIZEN Nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans will tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead But if it were at liberty twould sure southward SECOND CITIZEN Why that way THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife SECOND CITIZEN You are never without your tricks You may you may THIRD CITIZEN Are you all resolved to give your voices But thats no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility with Menenius Here he comes and in the gown of humility Mark his behaviour We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes Hes to make his requests by particulars wherein everyone of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues Therefore follow me and Ill direct you how you shall go by him ALL Content content Exeunt MENENIUS O sir you are not right Have you not known The worthiest men have donet CORIOLANUS What must I say I pray sirplague upont I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace Look sir my wounds I got them in my countrys service when Some certain of your brethren roared and ran From th noise of our own drums MENENIUS O me the gods You must not speak of that You must desire them To think upon you CORIOLANUS Think upon me Hang em I would they would forget me like the virtues Which our divines lose by em MENENIUS Youll mar all Ill leave you Pray you speak to em I pray you In wholesome manner Exit Menenius CORIOLANUS Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean Enter three of the Citizens So here comes a brace You know the cause sirs of my standing here THIRD CITIZEN We do sir Tell us what hath brought you tot CORIOLANUS Mine own desert SECOND CITIZEN Your own desert CORIOLANUS Ay but not mine own desire THIRD CITIZEN How not your own desire CORIOLANUS No sir twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging THIRD CITIZEN You must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you CORIOLANUS Well then I pray your price o th consulship FIRST CITIZEN The price is to ask it kindly CORIOLANUS Kindly sir I pray let me hat I have wounds to show you which shall be yours in privateYour good voice sir What say you SECOND CITIZEN You shall ha it worthy sir CORIOLANUS A match sir Theres in all two worthy voices begged I have your alms Adieu THIRD CITIZEN But this is something odd SECOND CITIZEN An twere to give againbut tis no matter Exeunt two citizens Enter two other Citizens CORIOLANUS Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown FOURTH CITIZEN You have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly CORIOLANUS Your enigma FOURTH CITIZEN You have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common people CORIOLANUS You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle And since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly That is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you I may be consul FIFTH CITIZEN We hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily FOURTH CITIZEN You have received many wounds for your country CORIOLANUS I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther BOTH CITIZENS The gods give you joy sir heartily Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices Better it is to die better to starve Than crave the hire which first we do deserve Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear Their needless vouches Custom calls me tot What custom wills in all things should we dot The dust on antique time would lie unswept And mountainous error be too highly heaped For truth to oerpeer Rather than fool it so Let the high office and the honour go To one that would do thus I am half through The one part suffered the other will I do Enter three Citizens more Here come more voices Your voices For your voices I have fought Watched for your voices for your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of for your voices have Done many things some less some more Your voices Indeed I would be consul SIXTH CITIZEN He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voice SEVENTH CITIZEN Therefore let him be consul The gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people ALL THREE CITIZENS Amen amen God save thee noble consul Exeunt citizens CORIOLANUS Worthy voices Enter Menenius with Brutus and Sicinius MENENIUS You have stood your limitation and the Tribunes Endue you with the peoples voice Remains That in th official marks invested

keep you companyWill you along BRUTUS We stay here for the people SICINIUS Fare you well Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius He has it now and by his looks methinks Tis warm at his heart BRUTUS With a proud heart he wore His humble weeds Will you dismiss the people Enter the Pebleians SICINIUS How now my masters have you chose this man FIRST CITIZEN He has our voices sir BRUTUS We pray the gods he may deserve your loves SECOND CITIZEN Amen sir To my poor unworthy notice He mocked us when he begged our voices THIRD CITIZEN Certainly he flouted us downright FIRST CITIZEN No tis his kind of speech He did not mock us SECOND CITIZEN Not one amongst us save yourself but says He used us scornfully He should have showed us His marks of merit wounds received fors country SICINIUS Why so he did I am sure ALL No no No man saw em THIRD CITIZEN He said he had wounds which he could show in private And with his hat thus waving it in scorn I would be consul says he aged custom But by your voices will not so permit me Your voices therefore When we granted that Here was I thank you for your voices Thank you Your most sweet voices Now you have left your voices I have no further with you Was not this mockery SICINIUS Why either were you ignorant to seet Or seeing it of such childish friendliness To yield your voices BRUTUS Could you not have told him As you were lessoned When he had no power But was a petty servant to the state He was your enemy ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I th body of the weal and now arriving A place of potency and sway o th state If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to th plebeii your voices might Be curses to yourselves You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love Standing your friendly lord SICINIUS Thus to have said As you were foreadvised had touched his spirit And tried his inclination from him plucked Either his gracious promise which you might As cause had called you up have held him to Or else it would have galled his surly nature Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught So putting him to rage You should have taen th advantage of his choler And passed him unelected BRUTUS Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need

as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband But it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of

all their trains PORTIA I pray you tarry pause a day or two Before you hazard for in choosing wrong I lose your company therefore forbear a while Theres something tells me but it is not love I would not lose you and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality But lest you should not understand me well And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me I could teach you How to choose right but then I am forsworn So will I never be So may you miss me But if you do youll make me wish a sin That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes They have oerlookd me and divided me One half of me is yours the other half yours Mine own I would say but if mine then yours And so all yours O these naughty times Puts bars between the owners and their rights And so though yours not yours Prove it so Let Fortune go to hell for it not I I speak too long but tis to peise the time To eche it and to draw it out in length To stay you from election BASSANIO Let me choose For as I am I live upon the rack PORTIA Upon the rack Bassanio Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love BASSANIO None but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear th enjoying of my love There may as well be amity and life Tween snow and fire as treason and my love PORTIA Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything BASSANIO Promise me life and Ill confess the truth PORTIA Well then confess and live BASSANIO Confess and love Had been the very sum of my confession O happy torment when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance But let me to my fortune and the caskets PORTIA Away then I am lockd in one of them If you do love me you will find me out Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof Let music sound while he doth make his choice Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end Fading in music That the comparison May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream And watry deathbed for him He may win And what is music then Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a newcrowned monarch Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear And summon him to marriage Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the seamonster I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th exploit Go Hercules Live thou I live With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makst the fray A song whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself Tell me where is fancy bred Or in the heart or in the head How begot how nourished Reply reply It is engendred in the eyes With gazing fed and fancy dies In the cradle where it lies Let us all ring fancys knell Ill begin itDing dong bell ALL Ding dong bell BASSANIO So may the outward shows be least themselves The world is still deceivd with ornament In law what plea so tainted and corrupt But being seasond with a gracious voice Obscures the show of evil In religion What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who inward searchd have livers white as milk And these assume but valours excrement To render them redoubted Look on beauty And you shall see tis purchasd by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature Making them lightest that wear most of it So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness often known To be the dowry of a second head The skull that bred them in the sepulchre Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold Hard food for Midas I will none of thee Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead Which rather threatenst than dost promise aught Thy palenness moves me more than eloquenceAnd here choose I joy be the consequence PORTIA Aside How all the other passions fleet to air As doubtful thoughts and rashembracd despair And shuddring fear and greeneyd jealousy O love be moderate allay thy ecstasy In measure rain thy joy scant this excess I feel too much thy blessing make it less For fear I surfeit BASSANIO What find I here Opening the leaden casket Fair Portias counterfeit What demigod Hath come so near creation Move these eyes Or whether riding on the balls of mine Seem they in motion Here are severd lips Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh tentrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs But her eyes How could he see to do them Having made one Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnishd Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance Heres the scroll The continent and summary of my fortune You that choose not by the view Chance as fair and choose as true Since this fortune falls to you Be content and seek no new If you be well pleasd with this And hold your fortune for your bliss Turn to where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave Kissing her I come by note to give and to receive Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes Hearing applause and universal shout Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no So thricefair lady stand I even so As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmd signd ratified by you PORTIA You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand Such as I am though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself A thousand times more fair ten thousand times More rich That only to stand high in your account I might in virtues beauties livings friends Exceed account But the full sum of me Is sum of something which to term in gross Is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractisd Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion master of my servants Queen oer myself and even now but now This house these servants and this same myself Are yoursmy lords I give them with this ring Which when you part from lose or give away Let it presage the ruin of your love And be my vantage to exclaim on you BASSANIO Madam you have bereft me of all words Only my blood speaks to you in my veins And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude Where every something being blent together Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy Expressd and not expressd But when this ring Parts from this finger then parts life from hence O then be bold to say Bassanios dead NERISSA My lord and lady it is now our time That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper To cry good joy Good joy my lord and lady GRATIANO My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish For I am sure you can wish none from me And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too BASSANIO With all my heart so thou canst get a wife GRATIANO I thank your lordship you have got me one My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours You saw the mistress I beheld the maid You lovd I lovd for intermission No more pertains to me my lord than you Your fortune stood upon the caskets there And so did mine too as the matter falls For wooing here until I sweat again And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love at last if promise last I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love provided that your fortune Achievd her mistress PORTIA Is this true Nerissa NERISSA Madam it is so you stand pleasd withal BASSANIO And do you Gratiano mean good faith GRATIANO Yes faith my lord BASSANIO Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage GRATIANO Well

GRATIANO Nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome Your hand Salerio Whats the news from Venice How doth that royal merchant good Antonio I know he will be glad of our success We are the Jasons we have won the fleece SALERIO I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost PORTIA There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the colour from Bassanios cheek Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man What worse and worse With leave Bassanio I am half yourself And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you BASSANIO O sweet Portia Here are a few of the unpleasantst words That ever blotted paper Gentle lady When I did first impart my love to you I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins I was a gentleman And then I told you true And yet dear lady Rating myself at nothing you shall see How much I was a braggart When I told you My state was nothing I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing for indeed I have engagd myself to a dear friend Engagd my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means Here is a letter lady The paper as the body of my friend And every word in it a gaping wound Issuing lifeblood But is it true Salerio Hath all his ventures faild What not one hit From Tripolis from Mexico and England From Lisbon Barbary and India And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch Of merchantmarring rocks SALERIO Not one my lord Besides it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew He would not take it Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man He plies the Duke at morning and at night And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice Twenty merchants The Duke himself and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture of justice and his bond JESSICA When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonios flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him And I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor Antonio PORTIA Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble BASSANIO The dearest friend to me the kindest man The best conditiond and unwearied spirit In

along My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows Come away For you shall hence upon your wedding day Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer Since you are dear bought I will love you dear But let me hear the letter of your friend BASSANIO Sweet Bassanio my ships have all miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since in

his reason well I know I oft deliverd from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me Therefore he hates me SALARINOI am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold ANTONIO The Duke cannot deny the course of law For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice if it be denied Twill much impeach the justice of the state Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations Therefore go These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor Well gaoler on pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt and then I care not Exeunt SCENE IV Belmont A room in Portias house Enter Portia Nerissa Lorenzo Jessica and Balthazar LORENZO Madam although I speak it in your presence You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord But if you knew to whom you show this honour How true a gentleman you send relief How dear a lover of my lord your husband I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you PORTIA I never did repent for doing good Nor shall not now for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments of manners and of spirit Which makes me think that this Antonio Being the bosom lover of my lord Must needs be like my lord If it be so How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty This comes too near the praising of myself Therefore no more of it Hear other things Lorenzo I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lords return For mine own part I have toward heaven breathd a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation Only attended by Nerissa here Until her husband and my lords return There is a monastery two miles off And there we will abide I do desire you

trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that

our ears Or who hath brought the fatal engine in That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound My heart is not compact of flint nor steel Nor can I utter all our bitter grief But floods of tears will drown my oratory And break my utterance even in the time When it should move you to attend me most And force you to commiseration Heres Romes young captain let him tell the tale While I stand by and weep to hear him speak LUCIUS Then noble auditory be it known to you That Chiron and the damned Demetrius Were they that murdered our emperors brother And they it were that ravished our sister For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded Our fathers tears despised and basely cozened Of that true hand that fought Romes quarrel out And sent her enemies unto the grave Lastly myself unkindly banished The gates shut on me and turned weeping out To beg relief among Romes enemies Who drowned their enmity in my true tears And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend I am the turnedforth be it known to you That have preserved her welfare in my blood And from her bosom took the enemys point Sheathing the steel in my adventrous body Alas you know I am no vaunter I My scars can witness dumb although they are That my report is just and full of truth But soft methinks I do digress too much Citing my worthless praise O pardon me For when no friends are by men praise themselves MARCUS Now is my turn to speak Behold the child Of this was Tamora delivered The issue of an irreligious Moor Chief architect and plotter of these woes The villain is alive in Titus house And as he is to witness this is true Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge These wrongs unspeakable past patience Or more than any living man could bear Now have you heard the truth What say you Romans Have we done aught amiss Show us wherein And from the place where you behold us pleading The poor remainder of Andronici Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls And make a mutual closure of our house Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall AEMILIUS Come come thou reverend man of Rome And bring our emperor gently in thy hand Lucius our emperor for well I know The common voice do cry it shall be so ROMANS Lucius all hail Romes royal emperor MARCUS Go go into old Titus sorrowful house And hither hale that misbelieving Moor To be adjudged some direful slaughtring death As punishment for his most wicked life Exeunt Attendants Lucius and Marcus come down from the upper stage ROMANS Lucius all hail Romes gracious governor LUCIUS Thanks gentle Romans May I govern so To heal Romes harms and wipe away her woe But gentle people give me aim awhile For nature puts me to a heavy task Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk He kisses Titus O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face The last true duties of thy noble son MARCUS Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips O were the sum of these that I should pay Countless and infinite yet would I pay them LUCIUS Come hither boy come come and learn of us To melt in showers Thy grandsire loved thee well Many a time he danced thee on his knee Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow Many a story hath he told to thee And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind And talk of them when he was dead and gone MARCUS How many thousand times hath these poor lips When they were living warmed themselves on thine O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss Bid him farewell commit him to the grave Do them that kindness and take leave of them YOUNG LUCIUS O grandsire grandsire een with all my heart Would I were dead so you did live again O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth Reenter Attendants with Aaron AEMILIUS You sad Andronici have done with woes Give sentence on the execrable wretch That hath been breeder of these dire events LUCIUS Set him breastdeep in earth and famish him There let him stand and rave and cry for food If anyone relieves or pities him For the offence he dies This is our doom Some stay to see him fastened in the earth AARON Ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb I am no baby I that with base prayers I should repent the evils I have done Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did Would I perform if I might have my will If one good deed in all my life I did I do repent it from my very soul LUCIUS Some loving friends convey the emperor hence And give him burial in his fathers grave My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our households monument As for that ravenous tiger Tamora No funeral rite nor man in mournful weed No mournful bell shall ring her burial But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey Her life was beastly and devoid of pity And being dead let birds on her take pity Exeunt TROILUS AND CRESSIDA

given me The knife that made it PANDARUS I speak no more than truth TROILUS Thou dost not speak so much PANDARUS Faith Ill not meddle int Let her be as she is if she be fair tis the better for her and

sober judgment BENEDICK Why i faith methinks shes too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like her CLAUDIO Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her BENEDICK Would you buy her that you enquire after her CLAUDIO Can the world buy such a jewel BENEDICK Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a good

worthy I know BENEDICK That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake DON PEDRO Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty CLAUDIO And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will BENEDICK That a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me up I

left their places vacant in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires All prompting me how fair young Hero is Saying I likd her ere I went to wars DON PEDRO Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it And I will break with her and with her father And thou shalt have her Wast not to this end That thou beganst to twist so fine a story CLAUDIO How sweetly you do minister to love That know loves grief by his complexion But lest my liking might too sudden seem I would have salvd it with a longer treatise DON

man of mine the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it LEONATO Hath the fellow any wit that told you this ANTONIO A good sharp fellow I will send for him and question him yourself LEONATO No no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true Go you and tell her of it Several persons cross the

You should hear reason DON JOHN And when I have heard it what blessings brings it CONRADE If not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance DON JOHN I wonder that thou being as thou sayst thou art born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no mans jests eat when I have stomach and wait for no mans leisure sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no mans business laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humour CONRADE Yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment You have of late stood out against your brother and he hath taen you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvestDON JOHN I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but I am a plaindealing villain I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage If I had my mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I would do my liking in the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me CONRADE Can you make no use of your discontent DON JOHN I make all use of it for I use it only Who comes here Enter Borachio What news Borachio BORACHIO I came yonder from a great supper the Prince your

the daughter and heir of Leonato DON JOHN A very forward Marchchick How came you to this BORACHIO Being entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a musty room comes me the Prince and Claudio hand in hand in sad conference I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself and having obtained her give her to Count Claudio DON JOHN Come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure That young startup hath all the glory of my overthrow if I can cross him any way I bless myself every way You are both sure and will assist me CONRADE To the death my lord DON JOHN Let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that I am subdued Would the cook were of my mind Shall we go to prove whats to be done BORACHIO Well wait upon your Lordship Exeunt ACT II SCENE I A hall in Leonatos house Enter Leonato Antonio Hero Beatrice and others LEONATO Was not Count John here at supper ANTONIO I saw him not BEATRICE How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after HERO He is of a very melancholy disposition BEATRICE He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling LEONATO Then half Signior Benedicks tongue in Count Johns mouth and half Count Johns melancholy in Signior Benedicks face BEATRICE With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her good will LEONATO By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue ANTONIO In faith shes too curst BEATRICE Too curst is more than curst I shall lessen Gods sending that way for it is said God sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none LEONATO So by being too curst God will send you no horns BEATRICE Just if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening Lord I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in the woollen LEONATO You may light on a husband that hath no beard BEATRICE What should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man I am not for him therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his apes into hell LEONATO Well then go you into hell BEATRICE No but to the gate and there will the Devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say Get you to heaven Beatrice get you to heaven heres no place for you maids So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long ANTONIO To Hero Well niece I trust you will be ruled by your father BEATRICE Yes faith it is my cousins duty to make curtsy and say Father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say Father as it please me LEONATO Well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband BEATRICE Not till God make men of some other metal than earth Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl No uncle Ill none Adams sons are my brethren and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred LEONATO Daughter remember what I told you if the Prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer BEATRICE The fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the Prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer For hear me Hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave LEONATO Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly BEATRICE I have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylight LEONATO The revellers are entering brother make good room Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick Balthasar Don John Borachio Margaret Ursula and Others masked DON PEDRO Lady will you walk about with your friend HERO So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away DON PEDRO With me in your company HERO I may say so when I please DON PEDRO And when please you to say so HERO When I like your favour for God defend the lute should be like the case DON PEDRO My visor is Philemons roof within the house is Jove HERO Why then your visor should be thatchd DON PEDRO Speak low if you speak love Takes her aside BALTHASAR Well I

itself Go to mum you are he graces will appear and theres an end BEATRICE Will you not tell me who told you so BENEDICK No you shall pardon me BEATRICE Nor will you not tell me who you are BENEDICK Not now BEATRICE That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of the Hundred Merry Tales Well this was Signior Benedick that said so BENEDICK Whats he BEATRICE I am sure you know him well enough BENEDICK Not I believe me BEATRICE Did he never make you laugh BENEDICK I pray you what is he BEATRICE Why he is the Princes jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet I would he had boarded me BENEDICK When I know the gentleman Ill tell him what you say BEATRICE Do do hell but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then theres a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night Music within We must follow the leaders BENEDICK In every good thing BEATRICE Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next turning Dance Then exeunt all but Don John Borachio and Claudio DON JOHN Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break

I in name of Benedick But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio Tis certain so the Prince woos for himself Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood This is an accident of hourly proof Which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero Reenter Benedick BENEDICK Count Claudio CLAUDIO Yea the same BENEDICK Come will you go with me CLAUDIO Whither BENEDICK Even to the next

you see him BENEDICK Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him and I think I told him true that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady and I offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped DON PEDRO To be whipped Whats his fault BENEDICK The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyd with finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals it DON PEDRO Wilt thou make a trust a transgression The transgression is in the stealer BENEDICK Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as I take it have stolen his birds nest DON PEDRO I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner BENEDICK If their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly DON PEDRO The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you BENEDICK O she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would

jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me She speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made Hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too Come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follow her

cue CLAUDIO Silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little happy if I could say how much Lady as you are mine I am yours I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange BEATRICE Speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither DON PEDRO In faith lady you have a merry heart BEATRICE Yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart CLAUDIO And so she doth cousin BEATRICE Good Lord for alliance Thus goes everyone to the world but I and I am sunburnt I may sit in a corner and cry heighho for a husband DON PEDRO Lady Beatrice I will get you one BEATRICE I would rather have one of your fathers getting Hath your Grace neer a brother like you Your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them DON PEDRO Will you have me lady BEATRICE No my lord unless I might have another for working days your Grace is too costly to wear every day But I beseech your Grace pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matter DON PEDRO Your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour BEATRICE No sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was I born Cousins God give you joy LEONATO Niece will you look to those things I told you of BEATRICE I cry you mercy uncle By your Graces pardon Exit DON PEDRO By my troth a pleasant spirited lady LEONATO Theres little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I

out of suit DON PEDRO She were an excellent wife for Benedick LEONATO O Lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad DON PEDRO Count Claudio when mean you to go to church CLAUDIO Tomorrow my lord Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites LEONATO Not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind DON PEDRO Come you shake the head at so long a breathing but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go dully by us I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules labours which is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other I would fain have it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction LEONATO My lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings CLAUDIO And I my lord DON PEDRO And you too gentle Hero HERO I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband DON PEDRO And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty I will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I with your two helps will so practise on Benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only lovegods Go in with me and I will tell you my drift Exeunt SCENE II Another room in Leonatos house Enter Don John and Borachio DON JOHN It is so the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato BORACHIO Yea my lord but I can cross it DON JOHN Any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine How canst thou cross this marriage BORACHIO Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me DON JOHN Show me briefly how BORACHIO I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero DON JOHN I remember BORACHIO I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber window DON JOHN What life is in that to be the death of this marriage BORACHIO The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the Prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold upto a contaminated stale such a one as Hero DON JOHN What proof shall I make of that BORACHIO Proof enough to misuse the Prince to vex Claudio to undo Hero and kill Leonato Look you for any other issue DON JOHN Only to despite them I will endeavour anything BORACHIO Go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio asin love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maidthat you have discovered thus They will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of Heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown DON JOHN Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats BORACHIO Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me DON JOHN I will presently go learn their day of marriage Exeunt SCENE III Leonatos Garden Enter Benedick BENEDICK Boy Enter a Boy BOY Signior BENEDICK In my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard BOY I am here already sir BENEDICK I know that but I would have thee hence and here again Exit Boy I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but Ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another"

Silvia from my master and I came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg O tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hanged fort sure as I live he had suffered fort You shall judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Dukes table he had not been therebless the marka

back the letter and gives her another SILVIA I pray thee let me look on that again JULIA It may not be Good madam pardon me SILVIA There hold I will not look upon your masters lines I know they are stuffed with protestations And full of newfound oaths which he will break As easily as I do tear his paper She tears the second letter JULIA Madam he sends your ladyship this ring SILVIA The more

threw her sunexpelling mask away The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks And pinched the lilytincture of her face That now she is become as black as I SILVIA How tall was she JULIA About my stature for at Pentecost When all our pageants of delight were played Our youth got me to play the womans part And I was trimmed in Madam Julias gown Which served me as fit by all mens judgements As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height And at that time I made her weep agood For I did play a lamentable part Madam twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress moved therewithal Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow SILVIA She is beholding to thee gentle youth Alas poor lady desolate and left I weep myself to think upon thy words Here youth there is my purse I give thee this For thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovst her Farewell JULIA And she shall thank you fort if eer you know her Exeunt Silvia and Attendants A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful I hope my masters suit will be but cold Since she respects my mistress love so much Alas how love can trifle with itself Here is her picture let me see I think If I had such a tire this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flattered her a little Unless I flatter with myself too much Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love Ill get me such a coloured periwig Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine Ay but her foreheads low and mines as high What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come shadow come and take this shadow up For tis thy rival O thou senseless form Thou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored And were there sense in his idolatry My substance should be statue in thy stead Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake That used me so or else by Jove I vow I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee Exit ACT V SCENE I Milan An abbey Enter

Thou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me Who should be trusted when ones right hand Is perjured to

thou with perjury cleft the root O Proteus let this habit make thee blush Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment if shame live In a disguise of love It is the lesser blot modesty finds Women to change their shapes than men their minds PROTEUS Than men their minds Tis true O heaven were man But constant he were perfect That one error Fills him with faults makes him run through all th sins Inconstancy falls off ere it begins What is in Silvias face but I may spy More fresh in Julias with a constant eye VALENTINE Come come a hand from either Let me be blest to make

much ado to know myself SALARINO Your mind is tossing on the ocean There where your argosies with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood Or as it were the pageants of the sea Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them do them reverence As they fly by them with their woven wings SOLANIO Believe me sir had I such venture forth The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad SALARINO My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea I should not see the sandy hourglass run But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew dockd in sand Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone

their brothers fools Ill tell thee more of this another time But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon this opinion Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well a while Ill end my exhortation

not know the sound of thine own tongue ANTONIO Fare you well Ill grow a talker for this gear GRATIANO Thanks i faith for silence is only commendable In a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo ANTONIO Is that anything now BASSANIO Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search ANTONIO Well tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you today promisd to tell me of BASSANIO Tis not unknown to you Antonio How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance Nor do I now make moan to be abridgd From such a noble rate but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gagd To you Antonio I owe the most in money and in love And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe ANTONIO I pray you good Bassanio let me know it And if it stand as you yourself still do Within the eye of honour be assurd My purse my person my extremest means Lie all unlockd to your occasions BASSANIO In my schooldays when I had lost one shaft I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth and by adventuring both I oft found both I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence I owe you much and like a wilful youth That which I owe is lost But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt As I will watch the aim or to find both Or bring your latter hazard back again And thankfully rest debtor for the first ANTONIO You know me well and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done And I am prest unto it Therefore speak BASSANIO In Belmont is a lady richly left And she is fair and fairer than that word Of wondrous virtues Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages Her name is Portia nothing undervalud To Catos daughter Brutus Portia Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos strond And many Jasons come in quest of her O my Antonio had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate ANTONIO Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do That shall be rackd even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia Go presently inquire and so will I Where money is and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake Exeunt SCENE II Belmont A room in Portias house Enter Portia with her waitingwoman Nerissa PORTIA By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world NERISSA You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are And yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean Superfluity come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer PORTIA Good sentences and well pronouncd NERISSA They would be better if well followed PORTIA If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces It is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband O me the word choose I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbd by the will of a dead father Is it not hard Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse noneNERISSA Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations Therefore the lottry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come PORTIA I pray thee overname them and as thou namest them I will describe them and according to my description level at my affection NERISSA First there is the Neapolitan prince PORTIA Ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself I am much afeard my lady his mother playd false with a smith NERISSA Then is there the County Palatine PORTIA He doth nothing but frown as who should say And you will not have me choose He hears merry tales and smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be married to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth than to either of these God defend me from these two NERISSA How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon PORTIA God made him and therefore let him pass for a man In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the Neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine He is every man in no man If a throstle sing he falls straight acapring He will fence with his own shadow If I should marry him I should marry twenty husbands If he would despise me I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I shall never requite him NERISSA What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron of England PORTIA You know I say nothing to him for he understands not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English He is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse with a dumbshow How oddly he is suited I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his behaviour everywhere NERISSA What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour PORTIA That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his surety and seald under for another NERISSA How like you the young German the Duke of Saxonys nephew PORTIA Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast And the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall make shift to go without him NERISSA If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should refuse to accept him PORTIA Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without I know he will choose it I will do anything Nerissa ere I will be married to a sponge NERISSA You need not fear lady the having any of these lords They have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the caskets PORTIA If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my fathers will I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence And I pray God grant them a fair departure NERISSA Do you not remember lady in your fathers time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat PORTIA Yes yes it was Bassanio as I think so was he calld NERISSA True madam He of all the men that ever my foolish eyes lookd upon was the best deserving a fair lady PORTIA I remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy praise Enter a Servingman How now what news SERVINGMAN The four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave And there is a forerunner come from a fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight PORTIA If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his approach If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me Come Nerissa Sirrah go before Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door Exeunt SCENE III Venice A public place Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats well BASSANIO Ay sir for three months SHYLOCK For three months well BASSANIO For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound SHYLOCK Antonio shall become bound well BASSANIO May you stead me Will you pleasure me Shall I know your answer SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound BASSANIO Your answer to that SHYLOCK Antonio is a good man BASSANIO Have you heard any imputation to the contrary SHYLOCK Ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient Yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and other ventures he hath squandered abroad But ships are but boards sailors but men there be landrats and waterrats waterthieves and landthievesI mean piratesand then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks The man is notwithstanding sufficient Three thousand ducats I think I may take his bond BASSANIO Be assured you may SHYLOCK I will be assured I may And that I may be assured I will bethink me May I speak with Antonio BASSANIO If it please you to dine with us SHYLOCK Yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but I will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you What news on the Rialto Who is he comes here Enter Antonio BASSANIO This is Signior Antonio SHYLOCK Aside How like a fawning publican he looks I hate him for he is a Christian But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice If I can catch him once upon the hip I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him He hates our sacred nation and he rails Even there where merchants most do congregate On me my bargains and my wellwon thrift Which he calls interest Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him BASSANIO Shylock do you hear SHYLOCK I am debating of my present store And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats What of that Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe Will furnish me But soft how many months Do you desire To Antonio Rest you fair good signior Your worship was the last man in our mouths ANTONIO Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend Ill break a custom To Bassanio Is he yet possessd How much ye would SHYLOCK Ay ay three thousand ducats ANTONIO And for three months SHYLOCK I had forgot three months you told me so Well then your bond And let me see but hear you Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage ANTONIO I do never use it SHYLOCK When Jacob grazd his uncle Labans sheep This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf The third possessor ay he was the third ANTONIO And what of him Did he take interest SHYLOCK No not take interest not as you would say Directly interest mark what Jacob did When Laban and himself were compromisd That all the eanlings which were streakd and pied Should fall as Jacobs hire the ewes being rank In end of autumn turned to the rams And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act The skilful shepherd pilld me certain wands And in the doing of the deed of kind He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall particolourd lambs and those were Jacobs This was a way to thrive and he was blest And thrift is blessing if men steal it not ANTONIO This was a venture sir that Jacob servd for A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven Was this inserted to make interest good Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams SHYLOCK I cannot tell I make it breed as fast But note me signior ANTONIO Mark you this Bassanio The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek A goodly apple rotten at the heart O what a goodly outside falsehood hath SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats tis a good round sum Three months from twelve then let me see the rate ANTONIO Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you SHYLOCK Signior Antonio many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances Still have I borne it with a patient shrug For suffrance is the badge of all our tribe You call me misbeliever cutthroat dog And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine And all for use of that which is mine own Well then it now appears you need my help Go to then you come to me and you say Shylock we would have moneys You say so You that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold moneys is your suit What should I say to you Should I not say Hath a dog money Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats Or Shall I bend low and in a bondmans key With bated breath and whispring humbleness Say this Fair sir you spet on me on Wednesday last You spurnd me such a day another time You calld me dog and for these courtesies Ill lend you thus much moneys ANTONIO I am as like to call thee so again To spet on thee again to spurn thee too If thou wilt lend this money lend it not As to thy friends for when did friendship takeA breed for barren metal of his friend But lend it rather to thine enemy Who if he break thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty SHYLOCK Why look you how you storm I

throne Burned on the water The poop was beaten gold Purple the sails and so perfumed that The winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made The water which they beat to follow faster As amorous of their strokes For her own person It beggared all description she did lie In her pavilion clothofgold of tissue Oerpicturing that Venus where we see

leave her utterly ENOBARBUS Never He will not Age cannot wither her nor custom stale Her infinite variety Other women cloy The appetites they feed but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies For vilest things Become themselves in her that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish MAECENAS If beauty wisdom modesty can settle The heart of Antony Octavia is A blessed lottery to him AGRIPPA

young Ill tread these flats Consider When you above perceive me like a crow That it is place which lessens and sets off And you may then revolve what tales I have told you Of courts of princes of the tricks in war This service is not service so being done But being so allowd To apprehend thus Draws us a profit from all things we see And often to our comfort shall we find The sharded beetle in a

at honest freedom paid More pious debts to heaven than in all The foreend of my time But up to th mountains This is not hunters language He that strikes The venison first shall be the lord o th feast

Diomedes Menelaus and others AGAMEMNON Princes What grief hath set these jaundies oer your cheeks The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on earth below Fails in the promisd largeness checks and disasters Grow in the veins of actions highest reard As knots by the conflux of meeting sap Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth Nor princes is it matter new to us That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years siege yet Troy walls stand Sith every action that hath gone before Whereof we have record trial did draw Bias and thwart not answering the aim And that unbodied figure of the thought That gavet surmised shape Why then you princes Do you with cheeks abashd behold our works And call them shames which are indeed naught else But the protractive trials of great Jove To find persistive constancy in men The fineness of which metal is not found In fortunes love For then the bold and coward The wise and fool the artist and unread The hard and soft seem all affind and kin But in the wind and tempest of her frown Distinction with a broad and powerful fan Puffing at all winnows the light away And what hath mass or matter by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled NESTOR With due observance of thy godlike seat Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply Thy latest words In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth How many shallow bauble boats dare sail Upon her patient breast making their way With those of nobler bulk But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis and anon behold The strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut Bounding between the two moist elements Like Perseus horse Wheres then the saucy boat Whose weak untimberd sides but even now Corivalld greatness Either to harbour fled Or made a toast for Neptune Even so Doth valours show and valours worth divide In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks And flies fled under shadewhy then the thing of courage As rousd with rage with rage doth

tempers and the minds of all Should be shut uphear what Ulysses speaks Besides thapplause and approbation The which To Agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway To Nestor And thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life I give to both your speecheswhich were such As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece Should hold up high in brass and such again As venerable Nestor hatchd in silver Should with a bond of air strong as the axletree On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears To his experiencd tongueyet let it please both Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak AGAMEMNON Speak Prince of Ithaca and bet of less expect That matter needless of importless burden Divide thy lips than we are confident When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws We shall hear music wit and oracle ULYSSES Troy yet upon his basis had been down And the great Hectors sword had lackd a master But for these instances The specialty of rule hath been neglected And look how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain

heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthrond and spherd Amidst the other whose medcinable eye Corrects the influence of evil planets And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shakd Which is the ladder of all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce from dividable shores The primogenity and due of birth Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels But by degree stand in authentic place Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing melts In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong Between whose endless jar justice resides Should lose their names and so should justice too Then everything includes itself in power Power into will will into appetite And appetite an universal wolf So doubly seconded with will and power Must make perforce an universal preyAnd last eat up himself Great Agamemnon This chaos when degree is suffocate Follows the choking And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward with a purpose It hath to climb The generals disdaind By him one step below he by the next That next by him beneath so every step Exampld by the first pace that is sick Of his superior grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation And tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot Not her own sinews To end a tale of length Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength NESTOR Most wisely hath Ulysses here discoverd The fever whereof all our power is sick AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedy ULYSSES The great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action Which slanderer he imitation calls He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound Twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage Such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks Tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his pressd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries Excellent Tis Agamemnon right Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration Thats doneas near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like as Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries Excellent Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes NESTOR And in the imitation of these twain Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voicemany are infect Ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies weight Why this hath not a fingers dignity They call this bedwork mappry closetwar So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution NESTOR Let this be granted and Achilles horse Makes many Thetis sons Tucket AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus MENELAUS From Troy Enter Aeneas AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent AENEAS Is this great Agamemnons tent I pray you AGAMEMNON Even this AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles arm Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals AGAMEMNON How AENEAS Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers AENEAS Courtiers as free as debonair unarmd As bending angels thats their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Joves accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praisd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends AGAMEMNON Sir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas AENEAS Ay Greek that is my name AGAMEMNON Whats your affairs I pray you AENEAS Sir pardon tis for Agamemnons ears AGAMEMNON He hears naught privately that comes from Troy AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him I bring a trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speak AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnons sleeping hour That thou shalt know Trojan he is awake He tells thee so himself AENEAS Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud Sound trumpet We have great Agamemnon here in Troy A prince called HectorPriam is his father Who in this dull and longcontinued truce Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords If there be one among the fairst of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease That feeds his praise more than he fears his peril That knows his valour and knows not his fear That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hersto him this challenge Hector in view of Trojans and of Greeks Shall make it good or do his best to do it He hath a lady wiser fairer truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy To rouse a Grecian that is true in love If any come Hector shall honour him If none hell say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance Even so much AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hectors grandsire suckd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me Ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put this witherd brawns And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood Ill prove this troth with my three drops of blood AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ULYSSES Amen AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you sir Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor ULYSSES Nestor NESTOR What says Ulysses ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape NESTOR What ist ULYSSES This tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be croppd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all NESTOR Well and how ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libyathough Apollo knows Tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgement Ay with celerity find Hectors purpose Pointing on him ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you NESTOR Why tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Trojans taste our dearst repute With their finst palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly poisd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large It is supposd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As twere from forth us all a man distilld Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertaind limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech Therefore tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance theyll sell If not the lustre of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are doggd with two strange followers NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should share with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foild Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lottry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off Well dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our projects life this shape of sense assumes Ajax employd plucks down Achilles plumes NESTOR Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone Exeunt ACT II SCENE I The Grecian camp Enter Ajax and Thersites AJAX Thersites THERSITES Agamemnonhow if he had boils full all over generally AJAX

praise The chief perfections of that lovely dame Had I sufficient skill to utter them Would make a volume of enticing lines Able to ravish any dull conceit And which is more she is not so divine So full replete with choice of all delights But with as humble lowliness of mind She is content to be at your command Command I mean of virtuous chaste intents To love and honour Henry as her lord KING HENRY And otherwise will Henry neer presume Therefore my Lord Protector give consent That Margaret may be Englands royal queen GLOUCESTER So should I give consent to flatter sin You know my lord your Highness is betrothd Unto another lady of esteem How shall we then dispense with that contract And not deface your honour with reproach SUFFOLK As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths Or one that at a triumph having vowd To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists By reason of his adversarys odds A poor earls daughter is unequal odds And therefore may be broke without offence GLOUCESTER Why what I pray is Margaret more than that Her father is no better than an earl Although in glorious titles he excel SUFFOLK Yes my lord her father is a king The King of Naples and Jerusalem And of such great authority in France As his alliance will confirm our peace And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance GLOUCESTER And so the Earl of Armagnac may do Because he is near kinsman unto Charles EXETER Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower Where Reignier sooner will receive than give SUFFOLK A dower my lords Disgrace not so your king That he should be so abject base and poor To choose for wealth and not for perfect love Henry is able to enrich his queen And not to seek a queen to make him rich So worthless peasants bargain for their wives As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt in by attorneyship Not whom we will but whom his Grace affects Must be companion of his nuptial bed And therefore lords since he affects her most Most of all these reasons bindeth us In our opinions she should be preferrd For what is wedlock forced but a hell An age of discord and continual strife Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss And is a pattern of celestial peace Whom should we match with Henry being a king But Margaret that is daughter to a king Her peerless feature joined with her birth Approves her fit for none but for a king Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit More than in women commonly is seen Will answer our hope in issue of a king For Henry son unto a conqueror Is likely to beget more conquerors If with a lady of so high resolve As is fair Margaret he be linkd in love Then yield my lords and here conclude with me That Margaret shall be queen and none but she KING HENRY Whether it be through force of your report My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love I cannot tell but this I am assured I feel such sharp dissension in my breast Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear As I am sick with working of my thoughts Take therefore shipping post my lord to France Agree to any covenants and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crownd King Henrys faithful and anointed queen For your expenses and sufficient charge Among the people gather up a tenth Be gone I say for till you do return I rest perplexed with a thousand cares And you good uncle banish all offence If you do censure me by what you were Not what you are I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will And so conduct me where from company I may revolve and ruminate my grief Exit GLOUCESTER Ay grief I fear me both at first and last Exeunt Gloucester and Exeter SUFFOLK Thus Suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes As did the youthful Paris once to Greece With hope to find the like event in love But prosper better than the Troyan did Margaret shall now be queen and rule the King But I will rule both her the King and realm Exit THE SECOND

pillars of the state To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief Your grief the common grief of all the land What Did my brother Henry spend his youth His valour coin and people in the wars Did he so often lodge in open field In winters cold and summers parching heat To conquer France his true inheritance And did my brother Bedford toil his wits To keep by policy what Henry got Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick Received deep scars in France and Normandy Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself With all the learned council of the realm Studied so long sat in the council house Early and late debating to and fro How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe And had his highness in his infancy Crowned in Paris in despite of foes And shall these labours and these honours die Shall Henrys conquest Bedfords vigilance Your deeds of war and all our counsel die O peers of England shameful is this league Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame Blotting your names from books of memory Razing the characters of your renown Defacing monuments of conquered France Undoing all as all had never been CARDINAL Nephew what means this passionate discourse This peroration with such circumstance For France tis ours and we will keep it still GLOUCESTER Ay uncle we will keep it if we can But now it is impossible we should Suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purse SALISBURY Now by the death of Him that died for all These counties were the keys of Normandy But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son WARWICK For grief that they are past recovery For were there hope to conquer them again My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears Anjou and Maine Myself did win them both Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer And are the cities that I got with wounds Delivered up again with peaceful words Mort Dieu YORK For Suffolks duke may he be suffocate That dims the honour of this warlike isle France should have torn and rent my very heart Before I would have yielded to this league I never read but Englands kings have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives And our King Henry gives away his own To match with her that brings no vantages GLOUCESTER A proper jest and never heard before

our Protector in a rage Tis known to you he is mine enemy Nay more an enemy unto you all And no great friend I fear me to the King Consider lords he is the next of blood And heir apparent to the English crown Had Henry got an empire by his marriage And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west Theres reason he should be displeased at it Look to it lords Let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect What though the common people favour him Calling him Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice Jesu maintain your royal excellence With God preserve the good Duke Humphrey I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss He will be found a dangerous Protector BUCKINGHAM Why should he then protect our sovereign He being of

Buckingham and Somerset SALISBURY Pride went before Ambition follows him While these do labour for their own preferment Behoves it us to labour for the realm I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Did bear him like a noble gentleman Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal More like a soldier than a man o th church As stout and proud as he were lord of all Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal Warwick my son the comfort of my age Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping Hath won the greatest favour of the commons Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey And brother York thy acts in Ireland In bringing them to civil discipline Thy late exploits done in the heart of France When thou wert regent for our sovereign Have made thee feared and honoured of the people Join we together for the public good In what we can to bridle and suppress The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal With Somersets and Buckinghams ambition And as we may cherish Duke Humphreys deeds While they do tend the profit of the land WARWICK So God help Warwick as he loves the land And common profit of his country YORK And so says York Aside for he hath greatest cause

Normandy Stands on a tickle point now they are gone Suffolk concluded on the articles The peers agreed and Henry was well pleased To change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter I cannot blame them all What ist to them Tis thine they give away and not their own Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage And purchase friends and give to courtesans Still revelling like lords till all be gone Whileas the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands And shakes his head and trembling stands aloofWhile all is shared and all is borne away Ready to starve and dare not touch his own So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue While his own lands are bargained for and sold Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt Unto the princes heart of Calydon Anjou and Maine both given unto the French Cold news for me for I had hope of France Even as I have of fertile Englands soil A day will come when York shall claim his own And therefore I will take the Nevilles parts And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey And when I spy advantage claim the crown For thats the golden mark I seek to hit Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist Nor wear the diadem upon his head Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown Then York be still awhile till time do serve Watch thou and wake when others be asleep To pry into the secrets of the state Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and Englands dearbought Queen And Humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed And in my standard bear the arms of York To grapple with the house of Lancaster And force perforce Ill make him yield the crown Whose bookish rule hath pulled fair England down Exit SCENE II The Duke of Gloucesters House Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and

face Until thy head be circled with the same Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold What ist too short Ill lengthen it with mine And having both together heaved it up Well both together lift

child DIONYZA That she is dead Nurses are not the fates To foster it nor ever to preserve She died at night Ill say so Who can cross it Unless you play the pious innocent And for an honest attribute cry out She died by foul play CLEON O go to Well well Of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods Do like this worst DIONYZA Be one of those that thinks The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence And open this to Pericles I do shame To think of what a noble strain you are And of how coward a spirit CLEON To such proceeding Whoever but his approbation added Though not his prime consent he did not flow From honourable courses DIONYZA Be it so then Yet none does know but you how she came dead Nor none can know Leonine being gone She did distain my child and stood between Her and her fortunes none would look on her But cast their gazes on Marinas face Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin Not worth the time of day It pierced me through And though you call my course unnatural You not your child well loving yet I find It greets me as an enterprise of kindness Performd to your sole daughter CLEON Heavens forgive it DIONYZA And as for Pericles what should he say We wept after her hearse and yet we mourn Her monument is almost finishd and her epitaphs In glittering golden characters express A general praise to her and care in us At whose expense tis done CLEON Thou art like the harpy Which to betray dost with thine angels face Seize with thine eagles talons DIONYZA You are like one that superstitiously Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies But yet I know youll

stand ithe gaps to teach you The stages of our story Pericles Is now again thwarting the wayward seas Attended on by many a lord and knight To see his daughter all his lifes delight Old Helicanus goes

Then exeunt Cleon and Dionyza See how belief may suffer by foul show This borrowd passion stands for true old woe And Pericles in sorrow all devourd With sighs shot through and biggest tears oershowerd Leaves Tarsus and again embarks He swears Never to wash his face nor cut his hairs He puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears A tempest which his mortal vessel tears And yet he rides it out Now please you wit The epitaph is for Marina writ By wicked Dionyza Reads the inscription on Marinas monument The fairest sweetst and best lies here Who witherd in her spring of year She was of Tyrus the Kings daughter On whom foul death hath made this slaughter Marina was she calld and at her birth Thetis being proud swallowd some part o the earth Therefore the earth fearing to be oerflowd Hath Thetis birthchild on the heavens bestowd Wherefore she does and swears shell never stint Make raging battery upon shores of flint No visor does become black villany So well as soft and tender flattery

And do you now put on your best attire And do you now cull out a holiday And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompeys blood Be gone Run to your houses fall upon your knees Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude FLAVIUS Go go good countrymen and for this fault Assemble all the poor men of your sort Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all Exeunt Citizens See whether their basest metal be not movd They vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness Go you down that way towards the Capitol This way will I Disrobe the images If you do find them deckd with ceremonies MARULLUS May we do so You know it is the feast of Lupercal FLAVIUS It is no matter let no images Be hung with Caesars trophies Ill about And drive away the vulgar from the streets So do you too where you perceive them thick These growing feathers pluckd from Caesars wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness Exeunt SCENE II The same A public place Enter in procession with music Caesar Antony for the course Calphurnia Portia Decius Cicero Brutus Cassius and Casca a great crowd following among them a Soothsayer CAESAR Calphurnia CASCA Peace ho Caesar speaks Music ceases CAESAR Calphurnia CALPHURNIA Here my lord CAESAR Stand you directly in Antonius way When he doth run his course Antonius ANTONY Caesar my lord CAESAR Forget not in your speed Antonius To touch Calphurnia for our elders say The barren touched in this holy chase Shake off their sterile curse ANTONY I shall remember When Caesar says Do this it is performd CAESAR Set on and leave no ceremony out Music SOOTHSAYER Caesar CAESAR Ha Who calls CASCA Bid every noise be still peace yet again Music ceases CAESAR Who is it in the press that calls on me I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turnd to hear SOOTHSAYER Beware the Ides of March CAESAR What man is that BRUTUS A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March CAESAR Set him before me let me see his face CASSIUS Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar CAESAR What sayst thou to me now Speak once again SOOTHSAYER Beware the Ides of March CAESAR He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass Sennet Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius CASSIUS Will you go see the order of the course BRUTUS Not I CASSIUS I pray you do BRUTUS I am not gamesome I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony Let me not hinder Cassius your desires Ill leave you CASSIUS Brutus I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you BRUTUS Cassius Be not deceived if I have veild my look I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference Conceptions only proper to myself Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors But let not therefore my good friends be grieved Among which number Cassius be you one Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other men CASSIUS Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations Tell me good Brutus can you see your faceBRUTUS No Cassius for the eye sees not itself But by reflection by some other thing CASSIUS Tis just And it is very much lamented Brutus That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this ages yoke Have wishd that noble Brutus had his eyes BRUTUS Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me CASSIUS Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus Were I a common laugher or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout then hold me dangerous Flourish and shout BRUTUS What means this shouting I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king CASSIUS Ay do you fear it Then must I think you would not have it so BRUTUS I would not Cassius yet I love him well But wherefore do you hold me here so long What is it that you would impart to me If it be aught toward the general good Set honour in one eye and death i the other And I will look on both indifferently For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honour more than I fear death CASSIUS I know that virtue to be in you Brutus As well as I do know your outward favour Well honour is the subject of my story I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life but for my single self I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself I was born free as Caesar so were you We both have fed as well and we can both Endure the winters cold as well as he For once upon a raw and gusty day The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores Caesar said to me Darst thou Cassius now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point Upon the word Accoutred as I was I plunged in And bade him follow so indeed he did The torrent roard and we did buffet it With lusty sinews throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy But ere we could arrive the point proposd Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink I as Aeneas our great ancestor Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar And this man Is now become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake tis true this god did shake His coward lips did from their colour fly And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his lustre I did hear him groan Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius As a sick girl Ye gods it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone Shout Flourish BRUTUS Another general shout I do believe that these applauses are For some new honours that are heapd on Caesar CASSIUS Why man he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonourable graves Men at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars But in ourselves that we are underlings Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar Why should that name be sounded more than yours Write them together yours is as fair a name Sound them it doth become the mouth as well Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar Now in the names of all the gods at once Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great Age thou art shamd Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famd with more than with one man When could they say till now that talkd of Rome That her wide walls encompassd but one man Now is it Rome indeed and room enough When there is in it but one only man O you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brookd Th eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king BRUTUS That you do love me I am nothing jealous What you would work me to I have some aim How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter For this present I would not so with love I might entreat you Be any further movd What you have said I will consider what you have to say I will with patience hear and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things Till then my noble friend chew upon this Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us CASSIUS I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus Enter Caesar and his Train BRUTUS The games are done and Caesar is returning CASSIUS As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve And he will after his sour fashion tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today BRUTUS I will do so But look you Cassius The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow And all the rest look like a chidden train Calphurnias cheek is pale and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossd in conference by some senators CASSIUS Casca will tell us what the matter is CAESAR Antonius ANTONY Caesar CAESAR Let me have men about me that are fat Sleekheaded men and such as sleep anights Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look He thinks too much such men are dangerous ANTONY Fear him not Caesar hes not dangerous He is a noble Roman and well given CAESAR Would he were fatter But I fear him not Yet if my name were liable to fear I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much He is a great observer and he looks Quite through the deeds of men He loves no plays As thou dost Antony he hears no music Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort As if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit That could be movd to smile at anything Such men as he be never at hearts ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves And therefore are they very dangerous I rather tell thee what is to be feard Than what I fear for always I am Caesar Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf And tell me truly what thou thinkst of him Exeunt Caesar and his Train Casca stays CASCA You pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me BRUTUS Ay Casca tell us what hath chancd today That Caesar looks so sad CASCA Why you were with him were you not BRUTUS I should not then ask Casca what had chancd CASCA Why there was a crown offerd him and being offerd him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell ashouting BRUTUS What was the second noise for CASCA Why for that too CASSIUS They shouted thrice what was the last cry for CASCA Why for that too BRUTUS Was the crown offerd him thrice CASCA Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every puttingby mine honest neighbours shouted CASSIUS Who offerd him the crown CASCA Why Antony BRUTUS Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca CASCA I can as well be hangd as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronets and as I told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refusd it the rabblement hooted and clappd their chopt hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refusd the crown that it had almost choked Caesar for he swooned and fell down at it And for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air CASSIUS But soft I pray you What did Caesar swoon CASCA He fell down in the marketplace and foamd at mouth and was speechless BRUTUS Tis very like he hath the fallingsickness CASSIUS No Caesar hath it not but you and I And honest Casca we have the fallingsickness CASCA I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell down If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre I am no true man BRUTUS What said he when he came unto himself CASCA Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he pluckd me ope his doublet and offerd them his throat to cut And I had been a man of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I might go to hell among the rogues And so he fell When he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desird their worships to think it was his infirmity Three or four wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts But theres no heed to be taken of them if Caesar had stabbd their mothers they would have done no less BRUTUS And after that he came thus sad away CASCA Ay CASSIUS Did Cicero say anything CASCA Ay he spoke Greek CASSIUS To what effect CASCA Nay and I tell you that Ill neer look you i the face again But those that understood him smild at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs off Caesars images are put to silence Fare you well There was more foolery yet if I could remember it CASSIUS Will you sup with me tonight Casca CASCA No I am promisd forth CASSIUS Will you dine with me tomorrow CASCA Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating CASSIUS Good I will expect you CASCA Do so farewell both Exit Casca BRUTUS What a blunt fellow is this grown to be He was quick mettle when he went to school CASSIUS So is he now in executionOf any bold or noble enterprise However he puts on this tardy form This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite BRUTUS And so it is For this time I will leave you Tomorrow if you please to speak with me I will come home to you or if you will Come home to me and I will wait for you CASSIUS I will do so till then think of the world Exit Brutus Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see Thy honourable metal may be wrought From that it is disposd therefore tis meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes For who so firm that cannot be seducd Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius He should not humour me I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw As if they came from several citizens Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely Caesars ambition shall be glanced at And after this let Caesar seat him sure For we will shake him or worse days endure Exit SCENE III The same A street Thunder and lightning Enter from opposite sides Casca with his sword drawn and Cicero CICERO Good even Casca brought you Caesar home Why are you breathless and why stare you so CASCA Are not you moved when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rivd the knotty oaks and I have seen Th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds But never till tonight never till now Did I go through a tempest dropping fire Either there is a civil strife in heaven Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destruction CICERO Why saw you anything more wonderful CASCA A common slave youd know him well by sight Held up his left hand which did flame and burn Like twenty torches joind and yet his hand Not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd Besides I ha not since put up my sword Against the Capitol I met a lion Who glared upon me and went surly by Without annoying me And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformed with their fear who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace Hooting and shrieking When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet let not men say These are their reasons they are natural For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon CICERO Indeed it is a strangedisposed time But men may construe things after their fashion Clean from the purpose of the things themselves Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow CASCA He doth for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow CICERO Goodnight then Casca this disturbed sky Is not to walk in CASCA Farewell Cicero Exit Cicero Enter Cassius CASSIUS Whos there CASCA A Roman CASSIUS Casca by your voice CASCA Your ear is good Cassius what night is this CASSIUS A very pleasing night to honest men CASCA Who ever knew the heavens menace so CASSIUS Those that have known the earth so full of faults For my part I have walkd about the streets Submitting me unto the perilous night And thus unbraced Casca as you see Have bard my bosom to the thunderstone And when the cross blue lightning seemd to open The breast of heaven I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it CASCA But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us CASSIUS You are dull Casca and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want Or else you use not You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the Heavens But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts Why birds and beasts from quality and kind Why old men fools and children calculate Why all these things change from their ordinance Their natures and preformed faculties To monstrous quality why you shall find That Heaven hath infusd them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state Now could I Casca name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night That thunders lightens opens graves and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action yet prodigious grown And fearful as these strange eruptions are CASCA Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius CASSIUS Let it be who it is for Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors But woe the while our fathers minds are dead And we are governd with our mothers spirits Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish CASCA Indeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy CASSIUS I know where I will wear this dagger then Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit But life being weary of these worldly bars Never lacks power to dismiss itself If I know this know all the world besides That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure Thunder still CASCA So can I So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity CASSIUS And why should Caesar be a tyrant then Poor man I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep He were no lion were not Romans hinds Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws What trash is Rome What rubbish and what offal when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman then I know My answer must be made but I am armd And dangers are to me indifferent CASCA You speak to Casca and to such a man That is no fleering telltale Hold my hand Be factious for redress of all these griefs And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest CASSIUS Theres a bargain made Now know you Casca I have movd already Some certain of the noblestminded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honourabledangerous consequence And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompeys Porch for now this fearful night There is no stir or walking in the streets And the complexion of the element In favours like the work we have in hand Most bloody fiery and most terrible Enter Cinna CASCA Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste CASSIUS Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait He is a friend Cinna where haste you so CINNA To find out you Whos that Metellus Cimber CASSIUS No it is Casca one incorporate To our attempts Am I not stayd for Cinna CINNA I am glad ont What a fearful night is this Theres two or three of us have seen strange sights CASSIUS Am I not stayd for tell me CINNA Yes you are O Cassius if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party CASSIUS Be you content Good Cinna take this paper And look you lay it in the praetors chair Where Brutus may but find it and throw this In at his window set this up with wax Upon old Brutus statue all this done Repair to Pompeys Porch where you shall find us Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there CINNA All but Metellus Cimber and hes gone To seek you at your house Well I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me CASSIUS That done repair to Pompeys theatre Exit Cinna Come Casca you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house three parts of him Is ours already and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours CASCA O he sits high in all the peoples hearts And that which would appear offence in us His countenance like richest alchemy Will change to virtue and to worthiness CASSIUS Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited Let us go For it is after midnight and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him Exeunt ACT II SCENE I Rome Brutus orchard Enter Brutus BRUTUS What Lucius ho I cannot by the progress of the stars Give guess how near to dayLucius I say I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly When Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius Enter Lucius LUCIUS Calld you my lord BRUTUS Get me a taper in my study Lucius When it is lighted come and call me here LUCIUS I will my lord Exit BRUTUS It must be by his death and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general He would be crownd How that might change his nature theres the question It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking Crown himthat And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with Th abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar I have not known when his affections swayd More than his reason But tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambitions ladder Whereto the climberupward turns his face But when he once attains the upmost round He then unto the ladder turns his back Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend So Caesar may Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel Will bear no colour for the thing he is Fashion it thus that what he is augmented Would run to these and these extremities And therefore think him as a serpents egg Which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous And kill him in the shell Enter Lucius LUCIUS The taper burneth in your closet sir Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus seald up and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed Gives him the letter BRUTUS Get you to bed again it is not day Is not tomorrow boy the Ides of March LUCIUS I know not sir BRUTUS Look in the calendar and bring me word LUCIUS I will sir Exit BRUTUS The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them Opens the letter and reads Brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself Shall Rome c Speak strike redress Brutus thou sleepst awake Such instigations have been often droppd Where I have took them up Shall Rome c Thus must I piece it out Shall Rome stand under one mans awe What Rome My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was calld a kingSpeak strike redress Am I entreated To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise If the redress will follow thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus Enter Lucius LUCIUS Sir March is wasted fifteen days Knock within BRUTUS Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks Exit Lucius Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council and the state of man Like to a little kingdom suffers then The nature of an insurrection Enter Lucius LUCIUS Sir tis your brother Cassius at the door Who doth desire to see you BRUTUS Is he alone LUCIUS No sir there are moe with him BRUTUS Do you know them LUCIUS No sir their hats are pluckd about their ears And half their faces buried in their cloaks That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favour BRUTUS Let em enter Exit Lucius They are the faction O conspiracy Shamst thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free O then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracy Hide it in smiles and affability For if thou path thy native semblance on Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention Enter Cassius Casca Decius Cinna Metellus Cimber and Trebonius CASSIUS I think we are too bold upon your rest Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you BRUTUS I have been up this hour awake all night Know I these men that come along with you CASSIUS Yes every man of them and no man here But honours you and everyone doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you This is Trebonius BRUTUS He is welcome hither CASSIUS This Decius Brutus BRUTUS He is welcome too CASSIUS This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber BRUTUS They are all welcome What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night CASSIUS Shall I entreat a word They whisper DECIUS Here lies the east doth not the day break here CASCA No CINNA O pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day CASCA You shall confess that you are both deceivd Here as I point my sword the Sun arises Which is a great way growing on the South Weighing the youthful season of the year Some two months hence up higher toward the North He first presents his fire and the high East Stands as the Capitol directly here BRUTUS Give me your hands all over one by one CASSIUS And let us swear our resolution BRUTUS No not an oath If not the face of men The sufferance of our souls the times abuse If these be motives weak break off betimes And every man hence to his idle bed So let highsighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery But if these As I am sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valour The melting spirits of women then countrymen What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress what other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter and what other oath Than honesty to honesty engagd That this shall be or we will fall for it Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise Nor th insuppressive mettle of our spirits To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath when every drop of blood That every Roman bears and nobly bears Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passd from him CASSIUS But what of Cicero Shall we sound him I think he will stand very strong with us CASCA Let us not leave him out CINNA No by no means METELLUS O let us have him for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy mens voices to commend our deeds It shall be said his judgement ruld our hands Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear But all be buried in his gravity BRUTUS O name him not let us not break with him For he will never follow anything That other men begin CASSIUS Then leave him out CASCA Indeed he is not fit DECIUS Shall no man else be touchd but only Caesar CASSIUS Decius well urgd I think it is not meet Mark Antony so well belovd of Caesar Should outlive Caesar we shall find of him A shrewd contriver and you know his means If he improve them may well stretch so far As to annoy us all which to prevent Let Antony and Caesar fall together BRUTUS Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards For Antony is but a limb of Caesar Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood O that we then could come by Caesars spirit And not dismember Caesar But alas Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends Lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully Lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds And let our hearts as subtle masters do Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide em This shall mark Our purpose necessary and not envious Which so appearing to the common eyes We shall be calld purgers not murderers And for Mark Antony think not of him For he can do no more than Caesars arm When Caesars head is off CASSIUS Yet I fear him For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar BRUTUS Alas good Cassius do not think of him If he love Caesar all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar And that were much he should for he is given To sports to wildness and much company TREBONIUS There is no fear in him let him not die For he will live and laugh at this hereafter Clock strikes BRUTUS Peace count the clock CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three TREBONIUS Tis time to part CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no For he is superstitious grown of late Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustomd terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today DECIUS Never fear that if he be so resolved I can oersway him for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayd with trees And bears with glasses elephants with holes Lions with toils and men with flatterers But when I tell him he hates flatterers He says he does being then most flattered Let me work For I can give his humour the true bent And I will bring him to the Capitol CASSIUS Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him BRUTUS By the eighth hour is that the uttermost CINNA Be that the uttermost and fail not then METELLUS Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey I wonder none of you have thought of him BRUTUS Now good Metellus go along by him He loves me well and I have given him reason Send him but hither and Ill fashion him CASSIUS The morning comes upons Well leave you Brutus And friends disperse yourselves but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans BRUTUS Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily Let not our looks put on our purposes But bear it as our Roman actors do With untired spirits and formal constancy And so good morrow to you everyone Exeunt all but Brutus Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men Therefore thou sleepst so sound Enter Portia PORTIA Brutus my lord BRUTUS Portia what mean you Wherefore rise you now It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning PORTIA Nor for yours neither Y have ungently Brutus Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper You suddenly arose and walkd about Musing and sighing with your arms across And when I askd you what the matter was You stard upon me with ungentle looks I urgd you further then you scratchd your head And too impatiently stampd with your foot Yet I insisted yet you answerd not But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you So I did Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seemd too much enkindled and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humour Which sometime hath his hour with every man It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevaild on your condition I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of grief BRUTUS I am not well in health and that is all PORTIA Brutus is wise and were he not in health He would embrace the means to come by it BRUTUS Why so I do Good Portia go to bed PORTIA Is Brutus sick and is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humours Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness No my Brutus You have some sick offence within your mind Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of and upon my knees I charm you by my once commended beauty By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me your self your half Why you are heavy and what men tonight Have had resort to you for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness BRUTUS Kneel not gentle Portia PORTIA I should not need if you were gentle Brutus Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you Am I your self But as it were in sort or limitation To keep with you at meals comfort your bed And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure If it be no more Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife BRUTUS You are my true and honourable wife As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart PORTIA If this were true then should I know this secret I grant I am a woman but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife I grant I am a woman but withal A woman well reputed Catos daughter Think you I am no stronger than my sex Being so fatherd and so husbanded Tell me your counsels I will not disclose em I have made strong proof of my constancyGiving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh can I bear that with patience And not my husbands secrets BRUTUS O ye gods Render me worthy of this noble wife Knock Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart All my engagements I will construe to thee All the charactery of my sad brows Leave me with haste Exit Portia Enter Lucius with Ligarius Lucius whos that knocks LUCIUS Here is a sick man that would speak with you BRUTUS C"

with speed To some forlorn and naked hermitage Remote from all the pleasures of the world There stay until the twelve celestial signs Have brought about the annual reckoning If this austere insociable life Change not your offer made in heat of blood If frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love But that it bear this trial and last love Then at the

be won You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day Visit the speechless sick and still converse With groaning wretches and your task shall be With all the fierce endeavour of your wit To enforce

frozen home in pail When blood is nipped and ways be foul Then nightly sings the staring owl Tuwhit Tuwhoo A merry note While greasy Joan doth keel the pot When all aloud the wind doth blow And coughing drowns the parsons saw And birds sit brooding in the snow And Marians nose looks red and raw When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl Then nightly sings the staring owl Tuwhit Tuwhoo A merry note

our welldealing countrymen Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives Have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods Excludes all pity from our threatning looks For since the mortal and intestine jars Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay more if any born at Ephesus Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs Again if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him Thy substance valued at the highest rate Cannot amount unto a hundred marks Therefore by law thou art condemnd to die EGEON Yet this my comfort when your words are done My woes end likewise with the evening sun DUKE Well Syracusian say in brief the cause Why thou departedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camst to Ephesus EGEON A heavier task could not have been imposd Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable Yet that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature not by vile offence Ill utter what my sorrow gives me leave In Syracusa was I born and wed Unto a woman happy but for me And by me had not our hap been bad With her I livd in joy our wealth increasd By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum till my factors death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons And which was strange the one so like the other As could not be distinguishd but by names That very hour and in the selfsame inn A mean woman was delivered Of such a burden male twins both alike Those for their parents were exceeding poor I bought and brought up to attend my sons My wife not meanly proud of two such boys Made daily motions for our home return Unwilling I agreed alas too soon We came aboard A league from Epidamnum had we saild Before the alwayswindobeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm But longer did we not retain much hope For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death Which though myself would gladly have embracd Yet the incessant weepings of my wife Weeping before for what she saw must come And piteous plainings of the pretty babes That mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear Forcd me to seek delays for them and me And this it was for other means was none The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship then sinkingripe to us My wife more careful for the latterborn Had fastned him unto a small spare mast Such as seafaring men provide for storms To him one of the other twins was bound Whilst I had been like heedful of the other The children thus disposd my wife and I Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd Fastned ourselves at either end the mast And floating straight obedient to the stream Was carried towards Corinth as we thought At length the sun gazing upon the earth Dispersd those vapours that offended us And by the benefit of his wished light The seas waxd calm and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this But ere they cameO let me say no more Gather the sequel by that went before DUKE Nay forward old man do not break off so For we may pity though not pardon thee EGEON O had the gods done so I had not now Worthily termd them merciless to us For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues We were encountered by a mighty rock Which being violently borne upon Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst So that in this unjust divorce of us Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in what to sorrow for Her part poor soul seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe Was carried with more speed before the wind And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth as we thought At length another ship had seizd on us And knowing whom it was their hap to save Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrackd guests And would have reft the fishers of their prey Had not their bark been very slow of sail And therefore homeward did they bend their course Thus have you heard me severd from my bliss That by misfortunes was my life prolongd To tell sad stories of my own mishaps DUKE And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for Do me the favour to dilate at full What have befalln of them and thee till now EGEON My youngest boy and yet my eldest care At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother and importund me That his attendant so his case was like Reft of his brother but retaind his name Might bear him company in the quest of him Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see I hazarded the loss of whom I lovd Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia And coasting homeward came to Ephesus Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men But here must end the story of my life And happy were I in my timely death Could all my travels warrant me they live DUKE Hapless Egeon whom the fates have markd To bear the extremity of dire mishap Now trust me were it not against our laws Against my crown my oath my dignity Which princes would they may not disannul My soul should sue as advocate for thee But though thou art adjudged to the death And passed sentence may not be recalld But to our honours great disparagement Yet will I favour thee in what I can Therefore merchant Ill limit thee

breaks the pale And feeds from home poor I am but his stale LUCIANA Selfharming jealousy fie beat it hence ADRIANA Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense I know his eye doth homage otherwhere Or else what lets it but he would be here Sister you know he promisd me a chain Would that alone a love he would detain So he would keep fair quarter with his bed I see the jewel best enamelled Will

natures of the times deceased The which observed a man may prophesy With a near aim of the main chance of things As yet not come to life who in their seeds And weak beginning lie intreasured Such things become the hatch and brood of time And by the necessary form of this King Richard might create a perfect guess That great Northumberland then false to him Would of that seed grow to a greater

Justices On Bardolph lead the men away Exeunt Bardolph recruits c As I return I will fetch off these justices I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow Lord Lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the Turks tribute I do remember him at Clements Inn like a man made after supper of a cheeseparing When he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife He was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible He was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake He came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his goodnights And now is this Vices dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and Ill be sworn he neer saw him but once in the tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshals men I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court And now has he land and beefs Well Ill be acquainted with him if I return and t shall go hard but Ill make him a philosophers two stones to me If the young dace be a bait for the old pike I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him Let time shape and there an end Exit ACT IV SCENE I Yorkshire Gaultree Forest Enter the Archbishop of York Mowbray Hastings and others ARCHBISHOP What is this forest calld HASTINGS Tis Gaultree Forest an t shall please your Grace ARCHBISHOP Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth To know the numbers of our enemies HASTINGS We have sent forth already ARCHBISHOP Tis well done My friends and brethren in these great affairs I must acquaint you that I have received Newdated letters from Northumberland Their cold intent tenor and substance thus Here doth he wish his person with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality The which he could not levy whereupon He is retired to ripe his growing fortunes To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful meeting of their opposite MOWBRAY Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to piecesEnter a Messenger HASTINGS Now what news MESSENGER West of this forest scarcely off a mile In goodly form comes on the enemy And by the ground they hide I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand MOWBRAY The just proportion that we gave them out Let us sway on and face them in the field Enter Westmoreland ARCHBISHOP What wellappointed leader fronts us here MOWBRAY I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland WESTMORELAND Health and fair greeting from our general The prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster ARCHBISHOP Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace What doth concern your coming WESTMORELAND Then my lord Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech If that rebellion Came like itself in base and abject routs Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags And countenanced by boys and beggary I say if damnd commotion so appeard In his true native and most proper shape You reverend father and these noble lords Had not been here to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop Whose see is by a civil peace maintaind Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord Whose white investments figure innocence The dove and very blessed spirit of peace Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war Turning your books to graves your ink to blood Your pens to lances and your tongue divine To a loud trumpet and a point of war ARCHBISHOP Wherefore do I this So the question stands Briefly to this end we are all diseased And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever And we must bleed for it of which disease Our late King Richard being infected died But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland I take not on me here as a physician Nor do I as an enemy to peace Troop in the throngs of military men But rather show awhile like fearful war To diet rank minds sick of happiness And purge th obstructions which begin to stop Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly I have in equal balance justly weighd What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer And find our griefs heavier than our offences We see which way the stream of time doth run And are enforced from our most quiet there By the rough torrent of occasion And have the summary of all our griefs When time shall serve to show in articles Which long ere this we offerd to the King And might by no suit gain our audience When we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong The dangers of the days but newly gone Whose memory is written on the earth With yetappearing blood and the examples Of every minutes instance present now Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms Not to break peace or any branch of it But to establish here a peace indeed Concurring both in name and quality WESTMORELAND Whenever yet was your appeal denied Wherein have you been galled by the King What peer hath been subornd to grate on you That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forged rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotions bitter edge ARCHBISHOP My brother general the commonwealth To brother born an household cruelty I make my quarrel in particular WESTMORELAND There is no need of any such redress Or if there were it not belongs to you MOWBRAY Why not to him in part and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honours WESTMORELAND O my good Lord Mowbray Construe the times to their necessities And you shall say indeed it is the time And not the King that doth you injuries Yet for your part it not appears to me Either from the King or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on Were you not restored To all the Duke of Norfolks signories Your noble and right well remembred fathers MOWBRAY What thing in honour had my father lost That need to be revived and breathed in me The King that loved him as the state stood then Was force perforce compelld to banish him And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he Being mounted and both roused in their seats Their neighing coursers daring of the spur Their armed staves in charge their beavers down Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together Then then when there was nothing could have stayd My father from the breast of Bolingbroke O when the King did throw his warder down His own life hung upon the staff he threw Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke WESTMORELAND You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled But if your father had been victor there He neer had borne it out of Coventry For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love Were set on Hereford whom they doted on And blessd and graced indeed more than the King But this is mere digression from my purpose Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace That he will give you audience and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just You shall enjoy them everything set off That might so much as think you enemies MOWBRAY But he hath forcd us to compel this offer And it proceeds from policy not love WESTMORELAND Mowbray you overween to take it so This offer comes from mercy not from fear For lo within a ken our army lies Upon mine honour all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear Our battle is more full of names than yours Our men more perfect in the use of arms Our armour all as strong our cause the best Then reason will our hearts should be as good Say you not then our offer is compelld MOWBRAY Well by my will we shall admit no parley WESTMORELAND That argues but the shame of your offence A rotten case abides no handling HASTINGS Hath the Prince John a full commission In very ample virtue of his father To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon WESTMORELAND That is intended in the generals name I muse you make so slight a question ARCHBISHOP Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule For this contains our general grievances Each several article herein redressd All members of our cause both here and hence That are insinewd to this action Acquitted by a true substantial form And present execution of our wills To us and to our purposes confined We come within our awful banks again And knit our powers to the arm of peace WESTMORELAND This will I show the general Please you lords In sight of both our battles we may meet And either end in peace which God so frame Or to the place of difference call the swords Which must decide it ARCHBISHOP My lord we will do so Exit Westmoreland MOWBRAY There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand HASTINGS Fear you not that if we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains MOWBRAY Yea but our valuation shall be such That every slight and falsederived cause Yea every idle nice and wanton reason Shall to the King taste of this action That were our royal faiths martyrs in love We shall be winnowd with so rough a wind That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff And good from bad find no partition ARCHBISHOP No no my lord Note this the King is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances For he hath found to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life And therefore will he wipe his tables clean And keep no telltale to his memory That may repeat and history his loss To new remembrance For full well he knows He cannot so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion His foes are so enrooted with his friends That plucking to unfix an enemy He doth unfasten so and shake a friend So that this land like an offensive wife That hath enraged him on to offer strokes As he is striking holds his infant up And hangs resolved correction in the arm That was upreard to execution HASTINGS Besides the King hath wasted all his rods On late offenders that he now doth lack The very instruments of chastisement So that his power like to a fangless lion May offer but not hold ARCHBISHOP Tis very true And therefore be assured my good Lord Marshal If we do now make our atonement well Our peace will like a broken limb united Grow stronger for the breaking MOWBRAY Be it so Here is returnd my Lord of Westmoreland Enter Westmoreland WESTMORELAND The prince is here at hand Pleaseth your lordship To meet his Grace just distance tween our armies MOWBRAY Your Grace of York in Gods name then set forward ARCHBISHOP Before and greet his Grace My lord we come Exeunt SCENE II Another part of the forest Enter from one side Mowbray attended afterwards the Archbishop Hastings and others from the other side Prince John of Lancaster and Westmoreland Officers and others with them LANCASTER You are well encounterd here my cousin Mowbray Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop

hate ye I feel my heart new opened O how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes favours There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin More pangs and fears than wars or women have And when he falls he falls like Lucifer Never to hope again Enter Cromwell standing amazed Why how now Cromwell CROMWELL I have no power to speak sir WOLSEY What amazed At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline Nay an you weep I am fallen indeed CROMWELL How does your Grace WOLSEY Why well Never so truly happy my good Cromwell I know myself now and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities A still and quiet conscience The King has cured me I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders These ruined pillars out of pity taken A load would sink a navy too much honour O tis a burden Cromwell tis a burden Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven CROMWELL I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it WOLSEY I

full view of such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest As loud and to as many tunes Hats cloaks Doublets I think flew up and had their faces Been loose this day they had been lost Such joy I never saw before Greatbellied women That had not half a week to go like rams In the old time of war would shake the press And make em reel before em No man living Could say This is my wife there all were woven So strangely in one piece SECOND GENTLEMAN But what followed THIRD GENTLEMAN At length her Grace rose and with modest paces Came to the altar where she kneeled and saintlike Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly Then rose again and bowed her to the people When by the Archbishop of Canterbury She had all the royal makings of a queen As holy oil Edward Confessors crown The rod and bird of peace and all such emblems Laid nobly on her which performed the choir With all the choicest music of the kingdom Together sung Te Deum So she parted And with the same full state paced back again To York Place where the feast is held FIRST GENTLEMAN Sir You must no more call it York Place thats past For since the Cardinal fell that titles lost Tis now the Kings and called Whitehall THIRD GENTLEMAN I know it But tis so lately altered that the old name Is fresh about me SECOND GENTLEMAN What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the Queen THIRD GENTLEMAN Stokesley and Gardiner the one of Winchester Newly preferred from the Kings secretary The other London SECOND GENTLEMAN He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the Archbishops The

Griffith sick to death My legs like loaden branches bow to th earth Willing to leave their burden Reach a chair She sits So Now methinks I feel a little ease Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou ledst me That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey Was dead GRIFFITH Yes madam but I think your Grace Out of the pain you suffered gave no ear tot QUEEN KATHERINE Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died If well he stepped before me happily For my example GRIFFITH Well the voice goes madam For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York and brought him forward As a man sorely tainted to his answer He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill He could not sit his mule QUEEN KATHERINE Alas poor man GRIFFITH At last with easy roads he came to Leicester Lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot With all his covent honourably received him To whom he gave these words O father abbot An old man broken with the storms of state Is come to lay his weary bones among ye Give him a little earth for charity So went to bed where eagerly his sickness Pursued him still and three nights after this About the hour of eight which he himself Foretold should be his last full of repentance Continual meditations tears and sorrows He gave his honours to the world again His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace QUEEN KATHERINE So may he rest His faults lie gently on him Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him And yet with charity He was a man Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking Himself with princes one that by suggestion Tied all the kingdom Simony was fairplay His own opinion was his law I th presence He would say untruths and be ever double Both in his words and meaning He was never But where he meant to ruin pitiful His promises were as he then was mighty But his performance as he is now nothing Of his own body he was ill and gave The clergy ill example GRIFFITH Noble madam Mens evil manners live in brass their virtues We write in water May it please your Highness To hear me speak his good now QUEEN KATHERINE Yes good Griffith I were malicious else GRIFFITH This Cardinal Though from an humble stock undoubtedly Was fashioned to much honour From his cradle He was a scholar and a ripe and good one Exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading Lofty and sour to them that loved him not But to those men that sought him sweet as summer And though he were unsatisfied in getting Which was a sin yet in bestowing madam He was most princely Ever witness for him Those twins of learning that he raised in you Ipswich and Oxford one of which fell with him Unwilling to outlive the good that did it The other though unfinished yet so famous So excellent in art and still so rising That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue His overthrow heaped happiness upon him For then and not till then he felt himself And found the blessedness of being little And to add greater honours to his age Than man could give him he died fearing God QUEEN KATHERINE After my death I wish no other herald No other speaker of my living actions To keep mine honour from corruption But such an honest chronicler as Griffith Whom I most hated living thou hast made me With thy religious truth and modestyNow in his ashes honour Peace be with him Patience be near me still and set me lower I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith Cause the musicians play me that sad note I named my knell whilst I sit meditating On that celestial harmony I go to Sad and solemn music GRIFFITH She is asleep Good wench lets sit down quiet For fear we wake her Softly gentle Patience The vision Enter solemnly tripping one after another six Personages clad in white robes wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in their hands They first congee unto her then dance and at certain changes the first two hold a spare garland over her head at which the other four make reverent curtsies Then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two who observe the same order in their changes and holding the garland over her head which done they deliver the same garland to the last two who likewise observe the same order At which as it were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven And so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them The music continues QUEEN KATHERINE Spirits of peace where are ye Are ye all gone And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye GRIFFITH Madam we are here QUEEN KATHERINE It is not you I call for Saw ye none enter since I slept GRIFFITH None madam QUEEN KATHERINE No Saw you not even now a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun They promised me eternal happiness And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly GRIFFITH I am most joyful madam such good dreams Possess your fancy QUEEN KATHERINE Bid the music leave They are harsh and heavy to me Music ceases PATIENCE Do you note How much her Grace is altered on the sudden How long her face is drawn How pale she looks And of an earthly cold Mark her eyes GRIFFITH She

unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord thy king thy governor It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds And in no sense is meet or amiable A woman movd is like a fountain troubled Muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty And while it is so none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land To watch the night in storms the day in cold Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love fair looks and true obedience Too little payment for so great a debt Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord I am ashamd that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toil and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts Come come you froward and unable worms My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot And place your hands below your husbands foot In token of which duty if he please My hand is ready may it do him ease PETRUCHIO Why theres a wench Come on and kiss me Kate LUCENTIO Well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt hat VINCENTIO Tis a good hearing when children are toward LUCENTIO But a harsh hearing when women are froward PETRUCHIO Come Kate well to bed We three are married but you two are sped Twas I won the wager To Lucentio though you hit the white And being a winner God give you good night Exeunt Petruchio and Katherina HORTENSIO Now go thy ways thou hast tamd a curst shrew LUCENTIO Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamd so Exeunt THE TEMPEST Contents ACT I Scene I On a

mounting to th welkins cheek Dashes the fire out O I have suffered With those that I saw suffer A brave vessel Who had no doubt some noble creature in her Dashd all to pieces O the cry did knock Against my very heart Poor souls they perishd Had I been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowd and The fraughting souls within her PROSPERO Be collected No more amazement tell your piteous heart Theres no harm done MIRANDA O woe the day PROSPERO No harm I have done nothing but in care of thee Of thee my dear one thee my daughter

my thoughts PROSPERO Tis time I should inform thee farther Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from meSo Lays down his mantle Lie there my art Wipe thou thine eyes have comfort The direful spectacle of the wrack which touchd The very virtue of compassion in thee I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul No not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heardst cry which thou sawst sink Sit down For thou must now know farther MIRANDA You have often Begun to tell me what I am but stoppd And left me to a bootless inquisition Concluding Stay not yet PROSPERO The hours now come The very minute bids thee ope thine ear Obey and be attentive Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not Out three years old MIRANDA Certainly sir I can PROSPERO By what By any other house or person Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance

sea that roard to us to sigh To th winds whose pity sighing back again Did us but loving wrong MIRANDA Alack what trouble Was I then to you PROSPERO O a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me Thou

and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter BRABANTIO A maiden never bold Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushd at herself and she in spite of nature Of years of country credit everything To fall in love with what she feard to look on It is judgement maimd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful oer the blood Or with some dram conjurd to this effect He wrought upon her DUKE To vouch this is no proof Without more wider and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him FIRST SENATOR But Othello speak Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maids affections Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth OTHELLO I do beseech you Send for the lady to the Sagittary And let her speak of me before her father If you do find me foul in her report The trust the office I do hold of you Not only take away but let your sentence Even fall upon my life DUKE Fetch Desdemona hither OTHELLO Ancient conduct them you best know the place Exeunt Iago and Attendants And till she come as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears Ill present How I did thrive in this fair ladys love And she in mine DUKE Say it Othello OTHELLO Her father lovd me oft invited me Still questiond me the story of my life From year to yearthe battles sieges fortunes That I have passd I ran it through even from my boyish days To the very moment that he bade me tell it Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances Of moving accidents by flood and field Of hairbreadth scapes i th imminent deadly breach Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery of my redemption thence And portance in my travelers history Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speaksuch was the process And of the Cannibals that each other eat The Anthropophagi and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline But still the house affairs would draw her thence Which ever as she could with haste dispatch Shed come again and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse which I observing Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively I did consent And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth sufferd My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange Twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful She wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd That heaven had made her such a man she thankd me And bade me if I had a friend that lovd her I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake She lovd me for the dangers I had passd And I lovd her that she did pity them This only is the witchcraft I have usd Here comes the lady Let her witness it Enter Desdemona Iago and Attendants DUKE I think this tale would win my daughter too Good Brabantio Take up this mangled matter at the best Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands BRABANTIO I pray you hear her speak If she confess that she was half the wooer Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the manCome hither gentle mistress Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience DESDEMONA My noble father I do perceive here a divided duty To you I am bound for life and education My life and education both do learn me How to respect you You are the lord of duty I am hitherto your daughter but heres my husband And so much duty as my mother showd To you preferring you before her father So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord BRABANTIO God be with you I have done Please it your grace on to the state affairs I had rather to adopt a child than get it Come hither Moor I here do give thee that with all my heart Which but thou hast already with all my heart I would keep from theeFor your sake jewel I am glad at soul I have no other child For thy escape would teach me tyranny To hang clogs on themI have done my lord DUKE Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which as a grise or step may help these lovers Into your favour When remedies are past the griefs are ended By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on What cannot be preserved when fortune takes Patience her injury a mockery makes The robbd that smiles steals something from the thief He robs himself that spends a bootless grief BRABANTIO So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile We lose it not so long as we can smile He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow These sentences to sugar or to gall Being strong on both sides are equivocal But words are words I never yet did hear That the bruisd heart was pierced through the ear I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state DUKE The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you And though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition OTHELLO The tyrant custom most grave senators Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thricedriven bed of down I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness and do undertake This present wars against the Ottomites Most humbly therefore bending to your state I crave fit disposition for my wife Due reference of place and exhibition With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding DUKE If you please Bet at her fathers BRABANTIO Ill not have it so OTHELLO Nor I DESDEMONA Nor I I would not there reside To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye Most gracious duke To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice T assist my simpleness DUKE What would you Desdemona DESDEMONA That I did love the Moor to live with him My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world my hearts subdued Even to the very quality of my lord I saw Othellos visage in his mind And to his honours and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate So that dear lords if I be left behind A moth of peace and he go to the war The rites for which I love him are bereft me And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence Let me go with him OTHELLO Let her have your voice Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not To please the palate of my appetite Nor to comply with heat the young affects In me defunct and proper satisfaction But to be free and bounteous to her mind And heaven defend your good souls that you think I will your serious and great business scant For she is with me No when lightwingd toys Of featherd Cupid seel with wanton dullness My speculative and officd instruments That my disports corrupt and taint my business Let housewives make a skillet of my helm And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation DUKE Be it as you shall privately determine Either for her stay or going The affair cries haste And speed must answer it FIRST SENATOR You must away tonight OTHELLO With all my heart DUKE At nine i the morning here well meet again Othello leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you OTHELLO So please your grace my ancient A man he is of honesty and trust To his conveyance I assign my wife With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me DUKE Let it be so Good night to everyone To Brabantio And noble signior If virtue no delighted beauty lack Your soninlaw is far more fair than black FIRST SENATOR Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well BRABANTIO Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see She has deceivd her father and may thee Exeunt Duke Senators Officers c OTHELLO My life upon her faith Honest Iago My Desdemona must I leave to thee I prithee let thy wife attend on her And bring them after in the best advantage Come Desdemona I have but an hour Of love of worldly matters and directionTo spend with thee We must obey the time Exeunt Othello and Desdemona RODERIGO Iago IAGO What sayst thou noble heart RODERIGO What will I do thinkest thou IAGO Why go to bed and sleep RODERIGO I will incontinently drown myself IAGO If thou dost I shall never love thee after Why thou silly gentleman RODERIGO It is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician IAGO O villainous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guineahen I would change my humanity with a baboon RODERIGO What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it IAGO Virtue a fig Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion RODERIGO It cannot be IAGO It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moorput money in thy pursenor he his to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in their wills Fill thy purse with money The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida She must change for youth When she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change she must Therefore put money in thy purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning Make all the money thou canst If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money A pox of drowning thyself It is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her RODERIGO Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue IAGO Thou art sure of me Go make money I have told thee often and I retell thee again and again I hate the Moor My cause is hearted thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will have more of this tomorrow Adieu RODERIGO Where shall we meet i the morning IAGO At my lodging RODERIGO Ill be with thee betimes IAGO Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo RODERIGO What say you IAGO No more of drowning do you hear RODERIGO I am changed Ill sell all my land Exit IAGO Thus do I ever make my fool my purse For I mine own gaind knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets He has done my office I know not if t be true But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety He holds me well The better shall my purpose work on him Cassios a proper man Let me see now To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery How how Lets see After some time to abuse Othellos ear That he is too familiar with his wife He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected framd to make women false The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men honest that but seem to be so And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are I havet It is engenderd Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light Exit ACT II SCENE I A seaport in Cyprus A Platform Enter Montano and two Gentlemen MONTANO What from the cape can you discern at sea FIRST GENTLEMAN Nothing at all it is a highwrought flood I cannot twixt the heaven and the main Descry a sail

shall we hear of this SECOND GENTLEMAN A segregation of the Turkish fleet For do but stand upon the foaming shore The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds The windshakd surge with high and monstrous main Seems to cast water on the burning Bear And quench the guards of the everfixed pole I never did like molestation view On the enchafed flood MONTANO If that the Turkish fleet Be not enshelterd and embayd they are drownd It is impossible to bear it out Enter a third Gentleman THIRD GENTLEMAN News lads Our wars are done The desperate tempest hath so bangd the Turks That their

Cassio Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello Is come on shore the Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus MONTANO I am glad ont Tis a worthy governor THIRD GENTLEMAN But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe for they were parted With foul and violent tempest MONTANO Pray heavens he be For I have servd him and the man commands Like a full soldier Lets to the seaside ho As well to see the vessel thats come in As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello Even till we make the main and the aerial blue An indistinct regard THIRD GENTLEMAN Come lets do so For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance Enter Cassio CASSIO Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor O let the heavens Give him defence against the elements For I have lost him on a dangerous sea MONTANO Is he well shippd CASSIO His bark is stoutly timberd and his pilot Of very expert and approvd

people and they cry A sail CASSIO My hopes do shape him for the governor A shot SECOND GENTLEMAN They do discharge their shot of courtesy Our friends at least CASSIO I pray you sir go forth And give us truth who tis that is arrivd SECOND GENTLEMAN I shall Exit MONTANO But good lieutenant is your general wivd CASSIO Most fortunately he hath achievd a maid That paragons description and wild fame One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens And in the essential vesture of creation Does tire the ingener Enter second Gentleman How now Who has put in SECOND GENTLEMAN Tis one Iago ancient to the general CASSIO He has had most favourable and happy speed Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds The gutterd rocks and congregated sands Traitors ensteepd to clog the guiltless keel As having sense of beauty do omit Their mortal natures letting go safely by The divine Desdemona MONTANO What is she CASSIO She that I spake of our great captains captain Left in the conduct of the bold Iago Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A sennights speed Great Jove Othello guard And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath That he may bless this bay with his tall ship Make loves quick pants in Desdemonas arms Give renewd fire to our extincted spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort Enter Desdemona Iago Roderigo and Emilia O behold The riches of the ship is come on shore Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees Hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven Before behind thee and on every hand Enwheel thee round DESDEMONA I thank you valiant Cassio What tidings can you tell me of my lord CASSIO He is not yet arrived nor know I aught But that hes well and will be shortly here DESDEMONA O but I fearHow lost you company Within A sail a sail CASSIO The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship But hark a sail Guns within SECOND GENTLEMAN They give their greeting to the citadel This likewise is a friend CASSIO See for the news Exit Gentleman Good ancient you are welcome To Emilia Welcome mistress Let it not gall your patience good Iago That I extend my manners tis my breeding That gives me this bold show of courtesy Kissing her IAGO Sir would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me You would have enough DESDEMONA Alas she has no speech IAGO In faith too much I find it still when I have list to sleep Marry before your ladyship I grant She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking EMILIA You have little cause to say so IAGO Come on come on you are pictures out of doors Bells in your parlours wildcats in your kitchens Saints in your injuries devils being offended Players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds DESDEMONA O fie upon thee slanderer IAGO Nay it is true or else I am a Turk You rise to play and go to bed to work EMILIA You shall not write my praise IAGO No let me not DESDEMONA What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me IAGO O gentle lady do not put me tot For I am nothing if not critical DESDEMONA Come on assayTheres one gone to the harbour IAGO Ay madam DESDEMONA I am not merry but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise Come how wouldst thou praise me IAGO I am about it but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze It plucks out brains and all but my Muse labours And thus she is deliverd If she be fair and wise fairness and witThe ones for use the other useth it DESDEMONA Well praisd How if she be black and witty IAGO If she be black and thereto have a wit Shell find a white that shall her blackness fit DESDEMONA Worse and worse EMILIA How if fair and foolish IAGO She never yet was foolish that was fair For even her folly helpd her to an heir DESDEMONA These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse What miserable praise hast thou for her thats foul and foolish IAGO Theres none so foul and foolish thereunto But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do DESDEMONA O heavy ignorance Thou praisest the worst best But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself IAGO She that was ever fair and never proud Had tongue at will and yet was never loud Never lackd gold and yet went never gay Fled from her wish and yet said Now I may She that being angerd her revenge being nigh Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cods head for the salmons tail She that could think and neer disclose her mind See suitors following and not look behind She was a wight if ever such wight were DESDEMONA To do what IAGO To suckle fools and chronicle small beer DESDEMONA O most lame and impotent conclusionDo not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husbandHow say you Cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor CASSIO He speaks home madam You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar IAGO Aside He takes her by the palm Ay well said whisper With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good well kissed an excellent courtesy Tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clysterpipes for your sake Trumpets within The Moor I know his trumpet CASSIO Tis truly so DESDEMONA Lets meet him and receive him CASSIO Lo where he comes Enter Othello and Attendants OTHELLO O my fair warrior DESDEMONA My dear Othello OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me O my souls joy If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have wakend death And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympushigh and duck again as low As hells from heaven If it were now to die Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate DESDEMONA The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow OTHELLO Amen to that sweet powers I cannot speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords be They kiss That eer our hearts shall make IAGO Aside O you are well tund now But Ill set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I am OTHELLO Come let us to the castle News friends our wars are done the Turks are drownd How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey you shall be well desird in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comfortsI prithee good Iago Go to the bay and disembark my coffers Bring thou the master to the citadel He is a good one and his worthiness Does challenge much respectCome Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprus Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants IAGO Do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come hither If thou best valiantas they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him RODERIGO With him Why tis not possible IAGO Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed And what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none A slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after A pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already RODERIGO I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition IAGO Blest figs end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that RODERIGO Yes that I did But that was but courtesy IAGO Lechery by this hand An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embracd together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight For the command Ill layt upon you Cassio knows you not Ill not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister RODERIGO Well IAGO Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell RODERIGO Adieu Exit IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evend with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash For his quick hunting stand the putting on Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness Tis here but yet confusd Knaverys plain face is never seen till usd Exit SCENE II A street Enter Othellos Herald with a proclamation HERALD It is Othellos pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addition leads him For besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello Exit SCENE III A Hall in the Castle Enter Othello Desdemona Cassio and Attendants OTHELLO Good Michael look you to the guard tonight Lets teach ourselves that honourable stop Not to outsport discretion CASSIO Iago hath direction what to do But notwithstanding with my personal eye Will I look tot OTHELLO Iago is most honest Michael good night Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you To Desdemona Come my dear love The purchase made the fruits are to ensue That profits yet to come tween me and you Good night Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants Enter Iago CASSIO Welcome Iago We must to the watch IAGO Not this hour lieutenant Tis not yet ten o th clock Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for Jove CASSIO Shes a most exquisite lady IAGO And Ill warrant her full of game CASSIO Indeed she is a most fresh and delicate creature IAGO What an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley to provocation CASSIO An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest IAGO And when she speaks is it not an alarm to love CASSIO She is indeed perfection IAGO Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of"

YORK Is all our travail turnd to this effect After the slaughter of so many peers So many captains gentlemen and soldiers That in this quarrel have been overthrown And sold their bodies for their countrys benefit Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace Have we not lost most part of all the towns By treason falsehood and by treachery Our great progenitors had conquered O Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief The utter loss of all the realm of France WARWICK Be patient York if we conclude a peace It shall be with such strict and severe covenants As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby

conditions of that league must be YORK Speak Winchester for boiling choler chokes The hollow passage of my poisond voice By sight of these our baleful enemies WINCHESTER Charles and the rest it is enacted thus That in regard King Henry gives consent Of mere compassion and of lenity To ease your country of distressful war And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace You shall become true liegemen to his crown And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear To pay him tribute and submit thyself Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him And still enjoy the regal dignity ALENON Must he be then as shadow of himself Adorn his temples with a coronet And yet in substance and authority Retain but privilege of a private man This proffer is absurd and reasonless CHARLES Tis known already that I am possessd With more than half the Gallian territories And therein reverenced for their lawful king Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquishd Detract so much from that prerogative As to be calld but viceroy of the whole No lord ambassador Ill rather keep That which I have than coveting for more Be cast from possibility of all YORK Insulting Charles Hast thou by secret means Used intercession to

Gloucester and Exeter KING HENRY Your wondrous rare description noble earl Of beauteous Margaret hath astonishd me Her virtues graced with external gifts Do breed loves settled passions in my heart And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide So am I driven by breath of her renown Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive Where I may have fruition of her love SUFFOLK Tush my good lord this superficial tale Is but a preface of her worthy praise The chief perfections of that lovely dame Had I sufficient skill to utter them Would make a volume of enticing lines Able to ravish any dull conceit And which is more she is not so divine So full replete with choice of all delights But with as humble lowliness of mind She is content to be at your command Command I mean of virtuous chaste intents To love and honour Henry as her lord KING HENRY And otherwise will Henry neer presume Therefore my Lord Protector give consent That Margaret may be Englands royal queen GLOUCESTER So should I give consent to flatter sin You know my lord your Highness is betrothd Unto another lady of esteem How shall we then dispense with that contract And not deface your honour with reproach SUFFOLK As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths Or one that at a triumph having vowd To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists By reason of his adversarys odds A poor earls daughter is unequal odds And therefore may be broke without offence GLOUCESTER Why what I pray is Margaret more than that Her father is no better than an earl Although in glorious titles he excel SUFFOLK Yes my lord her father is a king The King of Naples and Jerusalem And of such great authority in France As his alliance will confirm our peace And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance GLOUCESTER And so the Earl of Armagnac may do Because he is near kinsman unto Charles EXETER Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower Where Reignier sooner will receive than give SUFFOLK A dower my lords Disgrace not so your king That he should be so abject base and poor To choose for wealth and not for perfect love Henry is able to enrich his queen And not to seek a queen to make him rich So worthless peasants bargain for their wives As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt in by attorneyship Not whom we will but whom his Grace affects Must be companion of his nuptial bed And therefore lords since he affects her most Most of all these reasons bindeth us In our opinions she should be preferrd For what is wedlock forced but a hell An age of discord and continual strife Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss And is a pattern of celestial peace Whom should we match with Henry being a king But Margaret that is daughter to a king Her peerless feature joined with her birth Approves her fit for none but for a king Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit More than in women commonly is seen Will answer our hope in issue of a king For Henry son unto a conqueror Is likely to beget more conquerors If with a lady of so high resolve As is fair Margaret he be linkd in love Then yield my lords and here conclude with me That Margaret shall be queen and none but she KING HENRY Whether it be through force of your report My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love I cannot tell but this I am assured I feel such sharp dissension in my breast Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear As I am sick with working of my thoughts Take therefore shipping post my lord to France Agree to any covenants and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crownd King Henrys faithful and anointed queen For your expenses and sufficient charge Among the people gather up a tenth Be gone I say for till you do return I rest perplexed with a thousand cares And you good uncle banish all offence If you do censure me by what you were Not what you are I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will And so conduct me where from company I may revolve and ruminate my grief Exit GLOUCESTER Ay grief I fear me both at first and last Exeunt Gloucester and Exeter SUFFOLK Thus Suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes As did the youthful Paris once to Greece With hope to find the like event in love But prosper better than the Troyan did Margaret shall now

That face to face and royal eye to eye You have congreeted let it not disgrace me If I demand before this royal view What rub or what impediment there is Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births Should not in this best garden of the world Our fertile France put up her lovely visage Alas she hath from France too long been chasd And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps Corrupting in it own fertility Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart Unpruned dies her hedges evenpleachd Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair Put forth disorderd twigs her fallow leas The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs Losing both beauty and utility And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges Defective in their natures grow to wildness Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost or do not learn for want of time The sciences that should become our country But grow like savagesas soldiers will That nothing do but meditate on blood To swearing and stern looks diffusd attire And everything that seems unnatural Which to reduce into our former favour You are assembled and my speech entreats That I may know the let why gentle Peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualities KING HENRY If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace Whose want gives growth to the imperfections Which you have cited you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands Whose tenours and particular effects You have

QUEEN ISABEL Our gracious brother I will go with them Haply a womans voice may do some good When articles too nicely urgd be stood on KING HENRY Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us She is our capital demand comprisd Within the forerank of our articles QUEEN ISABEL She hath good leave Exeunt all except Henry Katharine and Alice KING HENRY Fair Katharine and most fair Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a ladys ear And plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart KATHARINE Your Majesty shall mock me I cannot speak your England KING HENRY O fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me Kate KATHARINE Pardonnezmoi I cannot tell wat is like me KING HENRY An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel KATHARINE Que ditil Que je suis semblable les anges ALICE Oui vraiment sauf votre Grce ainsi ditil KING HENRY I said so dear Katharine and I must not blush to affirm it KATHARINE O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies KING HENRY What says she fair one That the tongues of men are full of deceits ALICE Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de Princess KING HENRY The Princess is the better Englishwoman I faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say I love you then if you urge me farther than to say Do you in faith I wear out my suit Give me your answer i faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say you lady KATHARINE Sauf votre honneur me understand well KING HENRY Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into a wife Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off But before God Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urgd nor never break for urging If thou canst love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou livst dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curld pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king And what sayst thou then to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee KATHARINE Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France KING HENRY No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine KATHARINE I cannot tell wat is dat KING HENRY No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried wife about her husbands neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de moilet me see what then Saint Denis be my speeddonc votre est France et vous tes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at meKATHARINE Sauf votre honneur le franais que vous parlez il est meilleur que langlais lequel je parle KING HENRY No faith ist not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most trulyfalsely must needs be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much English canst thou love me KATHARINE I cannot tell KING HENRY Can any of your neighbours tell Kate Ill ask them Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet youll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because I love thee cruelly If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldierbreeder Shall not thou and I between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard Shall we not What sayst thou my fair flowerdeluce KATHARINE I do not know dat KING HENRY No tis hereafter to know but now to promise Do but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde mon trs cher et divin desse KATHARINE Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France KING HENRY Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in true English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew my fathers ambition He was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear My comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face Thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair Katharine will you have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say Harry of England I am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet is thine who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy English broken therefore queen of all Katharine break thy mind to me in broken English Wilt thou have me KATHARINE Dat is as it shall please le roi mon pre KING HENRY Nay it will please him well Kate it shall please him Kate KATHARINE Den it sall also content me KING HENRY Upon that I kiss your hand and call you my queen KATHARINE Laissez

to kiss before they are married would she say ALICE Oui vraiment KING HENRY O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a countrys fashion We are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all findfaults as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding Kissing her You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father Enter the French Power and the English Lords BURGUNDY God save your Majesty My royal cousin teach you our princess English KING HENRY I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good English BURGUNDY Is she not apt KING HENRY Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness BURGUNDY Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet rosd over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to KING HENRY Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces BURGUNDY They are then excusd my lord when they see not what they do KING HENRY Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking BURGUNDY I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summerd and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomewtide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on KING HENRY This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too BURGUNDY As love is my lord before it loves KING HENRY It is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way FRENCH KING Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities turnd into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls that no war hath entered KING HENRY Shall Kate be my wife FRENCH KING So please you KING HENRY I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will FRENCH KING We have consented to all terms of

Unto this bar and royal interview Your mightiness on both parts best can witness Since then my office hath so far prevaild That face to face and royal eye to eye You have congreeted let it not disgrace me If I demand before this royal view What rub or what impediment there is Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births Should not in this best garden of the world Our fertile France put up her lovely visage Alas she hath from France too long been chasd And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps Corrupting in it own fertility Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart Unpruned dies her hedges evenpleachd Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair Put forth disorderd twigs her fallow leas The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs Losing both beauty and utility And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges Defective in their natures grow to wildness Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost or do not learn for want of time The sciences that should become our country But grow like savagesas soldiers will That nothing do but meditate on blood To swearing and stern looks diffusd attire And everything that seems unnatural Which to reduce into our former favour You are assembled and my speech entreats That I may know the let why gentle Peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualities KING HENRY If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace Whose want gives growth to the imperfections Which you have cited you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands Whose tenours and particular effects You have enscheduld briefly in your hands BURGUNDY The King hath heard them to the which as

do some good When articles too nicely urgd be stood on KING HENRY Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us She is our capital demand comprisd Within the forerank of our articles QUEEN ISABEL She hath good leave Exeunt all except Henry Katharine and Alice KING HENRY Fair Katharine and most fair Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a ladys ear And plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart KATHARINE Your Majesty shall mock me I cannot speak your England KING HENRY O fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me Kate KATHARINE Pardonnezmoi I cannot tell wat is like me KING HENRY An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel KATHARINE Que ditil Que je suis semblable les anges ALICE Oui vraiment sauf votre Grce ainsi ditil KING HENRY I said so dear Katharine and I must not blush to affirm it KATHARINE O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies KING HENRY What says she fair one That the tongues of men are full of deceits ALICE Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de Princess KING HENRY The Princess is the better Englishwoman I faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say I love you then if you urge me farther than to say Do you in faith I wear out my suit Give me your answer i faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say you lady KATHARINE Sauf votre honneur me understand well KING HENRY Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into a wife Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes never off But before God Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urgd nor never break for urging If thou canst love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou livst dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curld pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king And what sayst thou then to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee KATHARINE Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France KING HENRY No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine KATHARINE I cannot tell wat is dat KING HENRY No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried wife about her husbands neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de moilet me see what then Saint Denis be my speeddonc votre est France et vous tes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at meKATHARINE Sauf votre honneur le franais que vous parlez il est meilleur que langlais lequel je parle KING HENRY No faith ist not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most trulyfalsely must needs be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much English canst thou love me KATHARINE I cannot tell KING HENRY Can any of your neighbours tell Kate Ill ask them Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet youll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because I love thee cruelly If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldierbreeder Shall not thou and I between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard Shall we not What sayst thou my fair flowerdeluce KATHARINE I do not know dat KING HENRY No tis hereafter to know but now to promise Do but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde mon trs cher et divin desse KATHARINE Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France KING HENRY Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in true English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew my fathers ambition He was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear My comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face Thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair Katharine will you have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say Harry of England I am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet is thine who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy English broken therefore queen of all Katharine break thy mind to me in broken English Wilt thou have me KATHARINE Dat is as it shall please le roi mon pre KING HENRY Nay it will please him well Kate it shall please him Kate KATHARINE Den it sall also content me KING HENRY Upon that I kiss your hand and call you my queen KATHARINE Laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez Ma foi je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant

findfaults as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding Kissing her You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father Enter the French Power and the English Lords BURGUNDY God save your Majesty My royal cousin teach you our princess English KING HENRY I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good English BURGUNDY Is she not apt KING HENRY Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness BURGUNDY Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet rosd over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to KING HENRY Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces BURGUNDY They are then excusd my lord when they see not what they do KING HENRY Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking BURGUNDY I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summerd and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomewtide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on KING HENRY This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too BURGUNDY As love is my lord before it loves KING HENRY It is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way FRENCH KING Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities turnd into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls that no war hath entered KING HENRY Shall Kate be my wife FRENCH KING So please you KING HENRY I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in

Attendants The Emperor brings the arrows in his hand that Titus shot at him SATURNINUS Why lords what wrongs are these Was ever seen An emperor in Rome thus overborne Troubled confronted thus and for the extent Of legal justice used in such contempt My lords you know as know the mightful gods However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the peoples ears there naught hath passed But even with law against the wilful sons Of old Andronicus And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks His fits his frenzy and his bitterness And now he writes to heaven for his redress See heres to Jove and this to Mercury This to Apollo this to the god of war Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome Whats this but libelling against the senate And blazoning our injustice everywhere A goodly humour is it not my lords As who would say in Rome no justice were But if I live his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus health whom if she sleep Hell so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proudst conspirator that lives TAMORA My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine Lord of my life commander of my thoughts Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus age Th effects of sorrow for his valiant sons Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts Aside Why thus it shall become Highwitted Tamora to gloze with all But Titus I have touched thee to the quick Thy lifeblood out if Aaron now be wise Then is all safe the anchor in the port Enter Clown How now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us CLOWN Yes forsooth an your mistresship be emperial TAMORA Empress I am but yonder sits the emperor CLOWN Tis he God and Saint Stephen give you good een I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here Saturninus reads the letter SATURNINUS Go take him away and hang him presently CLOWN How much money must I have TAMORA Come sirrah you must be hanged CLOWN Hanged byr Lady then I have brought up a neck to a fair end Exit guarded SATURNINUS Despiteful and intolerable wrongs Shall I endure this monstrous villainy I know from whence this same device proceeds May this be borne as if his traitorous sons That died by law for murder of our brother Have by my means been butchered wrongfully Go drag the villain hither by the hair Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege For this proud mock Ill be thy slaughterman Sly frantic wretch that holpst to make me great In hope thyself should govern Rome and me Enter Aemilius What news with thee Aemilius AEMILIUS Arm my lord Rome never had more cause The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of highresolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus did SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor I will enchant the old AndronicusWith words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep Whenas the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feed SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us TAMORA If Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue to Aemilius Go thou before be our ambassador Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him best AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually Exit TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devices SATURNINUS Then go successantly and plead to him Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Plains near Rome Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with drums and soldiers LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us Well follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believst no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath AARON What if I do not As indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sisters tongue and ravished her And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest LUCIUS O detestable villain callst thou that trimming AARON Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons heads Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the empress of this sport She sounded almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses GOTH What canst thou say all this and never blush AARON Ay like a black dog as the saying is LUCIUS Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds AARON Ay that I had not done a thousand more Even now I curse the day and yet I think Few come within the compass of my curse Wherein I did not some notorious ill As kill a man or else devise his death Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it Accuse some innocent and forswear myself Set deadly enmity between two friends Make poor mens cattle break their necks Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night And bid the owners quench them with their tears Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves And set them upright at their dear friends door Even when their sorrows almost was forgot And on their skins as on the bark of trees Have with my knife carved in Roman letters Let not your sorrow die though I am dead But I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand more LUCIUS Bring down the devil for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presently AARON If there be devils would I were a devil To live and burn in everlasting fire So I might have your company in hell But to torment you with my bitter tongue LUCIUS Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more Enter Aemilius GOTH My lord there is a messenger from Rome Desires to be admitted to your presence LUCIUS Let him come near Welcome Aemilius Whats the news from Rome AEMILIUS Lord Lucius and you princes of the Goths The Roman emperor greets you all by me And for he understands you are in arms He craves a parley at your fathers house Willing you to demand your hostages And they shall be immediately delivered FIRST GOTH What says our general LUCIUS Aemilius let the emperor give his pledges Unto my father and my uncle Marcus And we will come March away Exeunt SCENE II Rome Before Tituss House Enter Tamora and her two sons disguised TAMORA Thus in this strange and sad habiliment I will encounter with Andronicus And say I am Revenge sent from below To join with him and right his heinous wrongs Knock at his study where they say he keeps To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge Tell him Revenge is come to join with him And work confusion on his enemies They knock Titus above opens his study door TITUS Who doth molest my contemplation Is it your trick to make me ope the door That so my sad decrees may fly away And all my study be to no effect You are deceived for what I mean to do See here in bloody lines I have set down And what is written shall be executed TAMORA Titus I am come to talk with thee TITUS No not a word how can I grace my talk Wanting a hand to give it action Thou hast the odds of me therefore no more TAMORA If thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me TITUS I am not mad I know thee well enough Witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines Witness these trenches made by grief and care Witness the tiring day and heavy night Witness all sorrow that I know thee well For our proud empress mighty Tamora Is not thy coming for my other hand TAMORA Know thou sad man I am not Tamora She is thy enemy and I thy friend I am Revenge sent from th infernal kingdom To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes Come down and welcome me to this worlds light Confer with me of murder and of death Theres not a hollow cave or lurkingplace No vast obscurity or misty vale Where bloody murder or detested rape Can couch for fear but I will find them out And in their ears tell them my dreadful name Revenge which makes the foul offender quake TITUS Art thou Revenge And art thou sent to me To be a torment to mine enemies TAMORA I am therefore come down and welcome me TITUS Do me some service ere I come to thee Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands Now give some surance that thou art RevengeStab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels And then Ill come and be thy waggoner And whirl along with thee about the globe Provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away And find out murderers in their guilty caves And when thy car is loaden with their heads I will dismount and by the waggonwheel Trot like a servile footman all day long Even from Hyperions rising in the east Until his very downfall in the sea And day by day Ill do this heavy task So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there TAMORA These are my ministers and come with me TITUS Are they thy ministers What are they called TAMORA Rapine and Murder therefore called so Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men TITUS Good Lord how like the empress sons they are And you the empress But we worldly men Have miserable mad mistaking eyes O sweet Revenge now do I come to thee And if one arms embracement will content thee I will embrace thee in it by and by He exits above TAMORA This closing with him fits his lunacy Whateer I forge to feed his brainsick humours Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches For now he firmly takes me for Revenge And being credulous in this mad thought Ill make him send for Lucius his son And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure Ill find some cunning practice out of hand To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths Or at the least make them his enemies See here he comes and I must ply my theme Enter Titus TITUS Long have I been forlorn and all for thee Welcome dread Fury to my woeful house Rapine and Murder you are welcome too How like the empress and her sons you are Well are you fitted had you but a Moor Could not all hell afford you such a devil For well I wot the empress never wags But in her company there is a Moor And would you represent our queen aright It were convenient you had such a devil But welcome as you are What shall we do TAMORA What wouldst thou have us do Andronicus DEMETRIUS Show me a murderer Ill deal with him CHIRON Show me a villain that hath done a rape And I am sent to be revenged on him TAMORA Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong And I will be revenged on them all TITUS Look round about the wicked streets of Rome And when thou findst a man thats like thyself Good Murder stab him hes a murderer Go thou with him and when it is thy hap To find another that is like to thee Good Rapine stab him he is a ravisher Go thou with them and in the emperors court There is a queen attended by a Moor Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion For up and down she doth resemble thee I pray thee do on them some violent death They have been violent to me and mine TAMORA Well hast thou lessoned us this shall we do But would it please thee good Andronicus To send for Lucius thy thricevaliant son Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths And bid him come and banquet at thy house When he is here even at thy solemn feast I will bring in the empress and her sons The emperor himself and all thy foes And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart What says Andronicus to this device TITUS Marcus my brother tis sad Titus calls Enter Marcus Go gentle Marcus to thy nephew Lucius Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths Bid him repair to me and bring with him Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are Tell him the emperor and the empress too Feast at my house and he shall feast with them This do thou for my love and so let him As he regards his aged fathers life MARCUS This will I do and soon return again Exit TAMORA Now will I hence about thy business And take my ministers along with me TITUS Nay nay let Rape and Murder stay with me Or else Ill call my brother back again And cleave to no revenge but Lucius TAMORA Aside to them What say you boys Will you abide with him Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor How I have governed our determined jest Yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair And tarry with him till I come again TITUS Aside I knew them all though they suppose me mad And will oerreach them in their own devices A pair of cursed hellhounds and their dam DEMETRIUS Madam depart at pleasure leave us here TAMORA Farewell Andronicus Revenge now goes To lay a complot to betray thy foes TITUS I know thou

bind them fast Enter Titus Andronicus with a knife and Lavinia with a basin TITUS Come come Lavinia look thy foes are bound Sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me But let them hear what fearful words I utter O villains Chiron and Demetrius Here stands the spring whom you have stained with mud This goodly summer with your winter mixed You killed her husband and for that vile fault Two of her brothers were condemned to death My hand cut off and made a merry jest Both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear Than hands or tongue her spotless chastity Inhuman traitors you constrained and forced What would you say if I should let you speak Villains for shame you could not beg for grace Hark wretches how I mean to martyr you This one hand yet is left to cut your throats Whiles that Lavinia tween her stumps doth hold The basin that receives your guilty blood You know your mother means to feast with me And calls herself Revenge and thinks me mad Hark villains I will grind your bones to dust And with your blood and it Ill make a paste And of the paste a coffin I will rear And make two pasties of your shameful heads And bid that strumpet your unhallowed dam Like to the earth swallow her own increase This is the feast that I have bid her to And this the banquet she shall surfeit on For worse than Philomel you used my daughter And worse than Procne I will be revenged And now prepare your throatsLavinia come Receive the blood He cuts their throats And when that they are dead Let me go grind their bones to powder small And with this hateful liquor temper it And in that paste let their vile heads be baked Come come be everyone officious To make this banquet which I wish may prove More stern and bloody than the Centaurs feast So now bring them in for Ill play the cook And see them ready against their mother comes Exeunt carrying the dead bodies SCENE III Rome A Pavilion in Tituss Gardens with tables c Enter Lucius Marcus and the Goths with Aaron prisoner LUCIUS Uncle Marcus since tis my fathers mind That I repair to Rome I am content FIRST GOTH And ours with thine befall what fortune will LUCIUS Good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor This ravenous tiger this accursed devil Let him receive no sustnance fetter him Till he be brought unto the empress face For testimony of her foul proceedings And see the ambush of our friends be strong I fear the emperor means no good to us AARON Some devil whisper curses in my ear And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth The venomous malice of my swelling heart LUCIUS Away inhuman dog unhallowed slave Sirs help our uncle to convey him in Sound trumpets The trumpets show the emperor is at hand Exeunt Goths with Aaron Enter Emperor Saturninus and Empress Tamora with Aemilius Tribunes and others SATURNINUS What hath the firmament more suns than one LUCIUS What boots it thee to call thyself a sun MARCUS Romes emperor and nephew break the parle These quarrels must be quietly debated The feast is ready which the careful Titus Hath ordained to an honourable end For peace for love for league and good to Rome Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places SATURNINUS Marcus we will Trumpets sounding enter Titus like a cook placing the dishes with Young Lucius and others and Lavinia with a veil over her face TITUS Welcome my lord welcome dread queen Welcome ye warlike Goths welcome Lucius And welcome all Although the cheer be poor Twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it SATURNINUS Why art thou thus attired Andronicus TITUS Because I would be sure to have all well To entertain your highness and your empress TAMORA We are beholden to you good Andronicus TITUS An if your highness knew my heart you were My lord the emperor resolve me this Was it well done of rash Virginius To slay his daughter with his own right hand Because she was enforced stained and deflowered SATURNINUS It was Andronicus TITUS Your reason mighty lord SATURNINUS Because the girl should not survive her shame And by her presence still renew his sorrows TITUS A reason mighty strong and effectual A pattern precedent and lively warrant For me most wretched to perform the like Die die Lavinia and thy shame with thee And with thy shame thy fathers sorrow die He kills Lavinia SATURNINUS What hast thou done unnatural and unkind TITUS Killed her for whom my tears have made me blind I am as woeful as Virginius was And have a thousand times more cause than he To do this outrage and it now is done SATURNINUS What was she ravished Tell who did the deed TITUS Willt please you eat Willt please your highness feed TAMORA Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus TITUS Not I twas Chiron and Demetrius They ravished her and cut away her tongue And they twas they that did her all this wrong SATURNINUS Go fetch them hither to us presently TITUS Why there they are both baked in that pie Whereof their mother daintily hath fed Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred Tis true tis true witness my knifes sharp point He stabs the Empress SATURNINUS Die frantic wretch for this accursed deed He kills Titus LUCIUS Can the sons eye behold his father bleed He kills Saturninus Theres meed for meed death for a deadly deed A great tumult Lucius Marcus and others go aloft to the upper stageMARCUS You sadfaced men people and sons of Rome By uproar severed as a flight of fowl Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts O let me teach you how to knit again This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf These broken limbs again into one body Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to Like a forlorn and desperate castaway Do shameful execution on herself But if my frosty signs and chaps of age Grave witnesses of true experience Cannot induce you to attend my words Speak Romes dear friend to Lucius as erst our ancestor When with his solemn tongue he did discourse To lovesick Didos sad attending ear The story of that baleful burning night When subtle Greeks surprised King Priams Troy Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears Or who hath brought the fatal engine in That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound My heart is not compact of flint nor steel Nor can I utter all our bitter grief But floods of tears will drown my oratory And break my utterance even in the time When it should move you to attend me most And force you to commiseration Heres Romes young captain let him tell the tale While I stand by and weep to hear him speak LUCIUS Then noble auditory be it known to you That Chiron and the damned Demetrius Were they that murdered our emperors brother And they it were that ravished our sister For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded Our fathers tears despised and basely cozened Of that true hand that fought Romes quarrel out And sent her enemies unto the grave Lastly myself unkindly banished The gates shut on me and turned weeping out To beg relief among Romes enemies Who drowned their enmity in my true tears And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend I am the turnedforth be it known to you That have preserved her welfare in my blood And from her bosom took the enemys point Sheathing the steel in my adventrous body Alas you know I am no vaunter I My scars can witness dumb although they are That my report is just and full of truth But soft methinks I do digress too much Citing my worthless praise O pardon me For when no friends are by men praise themselves MARCUS Now is my turn to speak Behold the child Of this was Tamora delivered The issue of an irreligious Moor Chief architect and plotter of these woes The villain is alive in Titus house And as he is to witness this is true Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge These wrongs unspeakable past patience Or more than any living man could bear Now have you heard the truth What say you Romans Have we done aught amiss Show us wherein And from the place where you behold us pleading The poor remainder of Andronici Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls And make a mutual closure of our house Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall AEMILIUS Come come thou reverend man of Rome And bring our emperor gently in thy hand Luc"

your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein LUCULLUS La la la la Nothing doubting says he Alas good lord A noble gentleman tis if he would not keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha dined with him and told him ont and come again to supper to him of purpose to have

without security Heres three solidares for thee Good boy wink at me and say thou sawst me not Fare thee well FLAMINIUS Ist possible the world should so much differ And we alive that lived Fly damned baseness To him that worships thee Throws the money back LUCULLUS Ha Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master Exit FLAMINIUS May these add to the number that may scald thee Let molten coin be thy damnation Thou disease of a friend and not himself Has friendship such a faint and milky heart It turns in less than two nights O you gods I feel my masters passion This slave Unto his honour has my lords meat in him Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment When he is turned to poison O may diseases only work upont And when hes sick to death let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for be of any power To expel sickness but prolong his hour Exit SCENE II A public place Enter Lucius with three Strangers LUCIUS Who the Lord Timon He is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman FIRST STRANGER We know him for no less though we are but strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him LUCIUS Fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money SECOND STRANGER But believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely fort and showed what necessity belonged tot and yet was denied LUCIUS How SECOND STRANGER I tell you denied my lord LUCIUS What a strange case was that Now before the gods I am ashamed ont Denied that honourable man There was very little honour showed int For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should neer have denied his occasion so many talents Enter Servilius SERVILIUS See by good hap yonders my lord I have sweat to see his honour To Lucius My honoured lord LUCIUS Servilius You are kindly met sir Fare thee well Commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend SERVILIUS May it please your honour my lord hath sent LUCIUS Ha What has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord hes ever sending How shall I thank him thinkest thou And what has he sent now SERVILIUS Has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents LUCIUS I know his lordship is but merry with me He cannot want fiftyfive hundred talents SERVILIUS But in the meantime he wants less my lord If his occasion were not virtuous I should not urge it half so faithfully LUCIUS Dost thou speak seriously Servilius SERVILIUS Upon my soul tis true sir LUCIUS What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha shown myself honourable How unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to dothe more beast I sayI was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him SERVILIUS Yes sir I shall LUCIUS Ill look you out a good turn Servilius Exit Servilius True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed And he thats once denied will hardly speed Exit FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this Hostilius SECOND STRANGER Ay too well FIRST STRANGER Why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece Is every flatterers spirit Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish For in my knowing Timon has been this lords father And kept his credit with his purse Supported his estate nay Timons money Has paid his men their wages He neer drinks But Timons silver treads upon his lip And yetO see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape He does deny him in respect of his What charitable men afford to beggars THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it FIRST STRANGER For mine own part I never tasted Timon in my life Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend Yet I protest For his right noble mind illustrious virtue And honourable carriage Had his necessity made use of me I would have put my wealth into donation And the best half should have returned to him So much I love his heart But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense For policy sits above conscience Exeunt SCENE III The same A room in Sempronius house Enter a Third Servant of Timons with Sempronius another of Timons friends SEMPRONIUS Must he needs trouble me int Hum Bove all others He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus And now Ventidius is wealthy too Whom he redeemed from prison All these Owe their estates unto him SERVANT My lord They have all been touched and found base metal For they have all denied him SEMPRONIUS How Have they denied him Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me Three Humh It shows but little love or judgment in him Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians Thrive give him over Must I take th cure upon me Has much disgraced me int Im angry at him That might have known my place I see no sense fort But his occasions might have wooed me first For in my conscience I was the first man That eer received gift from him And does he think so backwardly of me now That Ill requite it last No So it may prove an argument of laughter To th rest and I mongst lords be thought a fool Id rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first but for my minds sake Id such a courage to do him good But now return And with their faint reply this answer join Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin Exit SERVANT Excellent Your lordships a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself byt and I cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his politic love This was my lords best hope now all are fled Save only the gods Now his friends are dead Doors that were neer acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employed Now to guard sure their master And this is all a liberal course allows Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house Exit SCENE IV A hall in Timons house Enter two of Varros Servants meeting Titus and Hortensius and then Lucius all Servants of Timons creditors to wait for his coming out FIRST VARROS SERVANT Well met good morrow Titus and Hortensius TITUS The like to you kind Varro HORTENSIUS Lucius What do we meet together LUCIUS Ay and I think One business does command us all For mine is money TITUS So is theirs and ours

LUCIUS Not yet PHILOTUS I wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven LUCIUS Ay but the days are waxed shorter with him You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the suns but not like his recoverable I fear tis deepest winter in Lord Timons purse That is one may reach deep enough and yet Find little PHILOTUS I am of your fear for that TITUS Ill show you how t observe a strange event Your lord sends now for money HORTENSIUS Most true he does TITUS And he wears jewels now of Timons gift For which I wait for money HORTENSIUS It is against my heart LUCIUS Mark how strange it shows Timon in this should pay more than he owes And een as if your lord should wear rich jewels And send for money for em HORTENSIUS Im weary of this charge the gods can witness I know my lord hath spent of Timons wealth And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth FIRST VARROS SERVANT Yes mines three thousand crowns Whats yoursLUCIUS Five thousand mine FIRST VARROS SERVANT Tis much deep and it should seem by th sum Your masters confidence was above mine Else surely his had equalled Enter Flaminius TITUS One of Lord Timons men LUCIUS Flaminius Sir a word Pray is my lord ready to come forth FLAMINIUS No indeed he is not TITUS We attend his lordship pray signify so much FLAMINIUS I need not tell him that he knows you are too diligent Exit Flaminius Enter Flavius in a cloak muffled LUCIUS Ha is not that his steward muffled so He goes away in a cloud Call him call him TITUS Do you hear sir SECOND VARROS SERVANT By your leave sir FLAVIUS What do you ask of me my friend TITUS We wait for certain money here sir FLAVIUS Ay If money were as certain as your waiting Twere sure enough Why then preferred you not your sums and bills When your false masters eat of my lords meat Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down th interest into their gluttonous maws You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up Let me pass quietly Believet my lord and I have made an end I have no more to reckon he to spend LUCIUS Ay but this answer will not serve FLAVIUS If twill not serve tis not so base as you For you serve knaves Exit FIRST VARROS SERVANT How What does his cashiered worship mutter SECOND VARROS SERVANT No matter what hes poor and thats revenge enough Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in Such may rail against great buildings Enter Servilius TITUS O heres Servilius now we shall know some answer SERVILIUS If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much fromt For taket of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has forsook him hes much out of health and keeps his chamber LUCIUS Many do keep their chambers are not sick And if it be so far beyond his health Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts And make a clear way to the gods SERVILIUS Good gods TITUS We cannot take this for answer sir FLAMINIUS Within Servilius help My lord my lord Enter Timon in a rage TIMON What are my doors opposed against my passage Have I been ever free and must my house Be my retentive enemy my jail The place which I have feasted does it now Like all mankind show me an iron heart LUCIUS Put in now Titus TITUS My lord here is my bill LUCIUS Heres mine HORTENSIUS And mine my lord BOTH VARROS SERVANTS And ours my lord PHILOTUS All our bills TIMON Knock me down with em Cleave me to the girdle LUCIUS Alas my lord TIMON Cut my heart in sums TITUS Mine fifty talents TIMON Tell out my blood LUCIUS Five thousand crowns my lord TIMON Five thousand drops pays that What yours and yours FIRST VARROS SERVANT My lord SECOND VARROS SERVANT My lord TIMON Tear me take me and the gods fall upon you Exit HORTENSIUS Faith I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money These debts may well be called desperate ones for a madman owes em Exeunt Enter Timon and Flavius TIMON They have een put my breath from me the slaves Creditors Devils FLAVIUS My dear lord TIMON What if it should be so FLAVIUS My lord TIMON Ill have it soMy steward FLAVIUS Here my lord TIMON So fitly Go bid all my friends again Lucius Lucullus and Sempronius all Ill once more feast the rascals FLAVIUS O my lord You only speak from your distracted soul There is not so much left to furnish out A moderate table TIMON Be it not in thy care Go I charge thee invite them all Let in the tide Of knaves once more My cook and Ill provide Exeunt SCENE V The same The senate house Enter three Senators at one door Alcibiades meeting them with Attendants FIRST SENATOR My lord you have my voice to t The faults Bloody Tis necessary he should die Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy SECOND SENATOR Most true the law shall bruise em ALCIBIADES Honour health and compassion to the senate FIRST SENATOR Now captain ALCIBIADES I am a humble suitor to your virtues For pity is the virtue of the law And none but tyrants use it cruelly It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood Hath stepped into the law which is past depth To those that without heed do plunge intot He is a man setting his fate aside Of comely virtues Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice An honour in him which buys out his fault But with a noble fury and fair spirit Seeing his reputation touched to death He did oppose his foe And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behave his anger ere twas spent As if he had but proved an argument FIRST SENATOR You undergo too strict a paradox Striving to make an ugly deed look fair Your words have took such pains as if they laboured To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling Upon the head of valour which indeed Is valour misbegot and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born Hes truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs His outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly And neer prefer his injuries to his heart To bring it into danger If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill What folly tis to hazard life for ill ALCIBIADES My lord FIRST SENATOR You cannot make gross sins look clear To revenge is no valour but to bear ALCIBIADES My lords then under favour pardon me If I speak like a captain Why do fond men expose themselves to battle And not endure all threats Sleep upont And let the foes quietly cut their throats Without repugnancy If there be Such valour in the bearing what make we Abroad Why then women are more valiant That stay at home if bearing carry it And the ass more captain than the lion the felon Loaden with irons wiser than the judge If wisdom be in suffering O my lords As you are great be pitifully good Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood To kill I grant is sins extremest gust But in defence by mercy tis most just To be in anger is impiety But who is man that is not angry Weigh but the crime with this SECOND SENATOR You breathe in vain ALCIBIADES In vain His service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life FIRST SENATOR Whats that ALCIBIADES Why I say my lords has done fair service And slain in fight many of your enemies How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict and made plenteous wounds SECOND SENATOR He has made too much plenty with em Hes a sworn rioter He has a sin That often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner If there were no foes that were enough To overcome him In that beastly fury He has been known to commit outrages And cherish factions Tis inferred to us His days are foul and his drink dangerous FIRST SENATOR He dies ALCIBIADES Hard fate He might have died in war My lords if not for any parts in him Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none yet more to move you Take my deserts to his and join em both And for I know your reverend ages love Security Ill pawn my victories all My honour to you upon his good returns If by this crime he owes the law his life Why let the war receivet in valiant gore For law is strict and war is nothing more FIRST SENATOR We are for law He dies Urge it no more On height of our displeasure Friend or brother He forfeits his own blood that spills another ALCIBIADES Must it be so It must not be My lords I do beseech you know me SECOND SENATOR How ALCIBIADES Call me to your remembrances THIRD SENATOR What ALCIBIADES I cannot think but your age has forgot me It could not else be I should prove so base To sue and be denied such common grace My wounds ache at you FIRST SENATOR Do you dare our anger Tis in few words but spacious in effect We banish thee for ever ALCIBIADES Banish me Banish your dotage banish usury That makes the Senate ugly FIRST SENATOR If after two days shine Athens contain thee Attend our weightier judgment And not to swell our spirit He shall be executed presently Exeunt Senators ALCIBIADES Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live Only in bone that none may look on you Im worse than mad I have kept back their foes While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest I myself Rich only in large hurts All those for this Is this the balsam that the usuring senate Pours into captains wounds Banishment It comes not ill I hate not to be banished It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury That I may strike at Athens Ill cheer up My discontented troops and lay for hearts Tis honour with most lands to be at odds Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods Exit SCENE VI A room of state in Timons house Music Enter divers Friends at several doors FIRST FRIEND The good time of day to you sir SECOND FRIEND I also wish it to you I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day FIRST FRIEND Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends SECOND FRIEND It should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting FIRST FRIEND I should think so He hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and I must needs appear SECOND FRIEND In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse I am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out FIRST FRIEND I am sick of that grief too as I understand how all things go SECOND FRIEND Every man heres so What would he have borrowed you FIRST FRIEND A thousand pieces SECOND FRIEND A thousand pieces FIRST FRIEND What of you SECOND FRIEND He sent to me sirhere he comes Enter Timon and Attendants TIMON With all my heart gentlemen both And how fare you FIRST FRIEND Ever at the best hearing well of your lordship SECOND FRIEND The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship TIMON Aside Nor more willingly leaves winter such summer birds are men Gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long stay Feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so harshly o th trumpets sound we shall tot presently FIRST FRIEND I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messenger TIMON O sir let it not trouble you SECOND FRIEND My noble lord TIMON Ah my good friend what cheer SECOND FRIEND My most honourable lord I am een sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggarTIMON Think not ont sir SECOND FRIEND If you had sent but two hours before TIMON Let it not cumber your better remembrance The banquet brought in Come bring in all together SECOND FRIEND All covered dishes FIRST FRIEND Royal cheer I warrant you THIRD FRIEND Doubt not that if money and the season can yield it FIRST FRIEND How do you Whats the news THIRD FRIEND Alcibiades is banished Hear you of it FIRST AND SECOND FRIENDS Alcibiades banished THIRD FRIEND Tis so be sure of it FIRST FRIEND How how SECOND FRIEND I pray you upon what TIMON My worthy friends will you draw near THIRD FRIEND Ill tell you more anon Heres a noble feast toward SECOND FRIEND This is the old man still THIRD FRIEND Willt hold willt hold SECOND FRIEND It does but time willand so THIRD FRIEND I do conceive TIMON Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress Your diet shall be in all places alike Make not a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place Sit sit The gods require our thanks You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness For your own gifts make yourselves praised but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised Lend to each man enough that one need not lend to another for were your godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains If there sit twelve women at the table let a dozen of them be as they are The rest of your foes O gods the senators of Athens together with the common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make suitable for destruction For these my present friends as they are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are they welcome Uncover dogs and lap The dishes are uncovered and prove to be full of lukewarm water SOME SPEAK What does his lordship mean SOME OTHER I know not TIMON May you a better feast never behold You knot of mouthfriends Smoke and lukewarm water Is your perfection This is Timons last Who stuck and spangled with your flatteries Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces Your reeking villainy Throws water in their faces Live loathed and long Most smiling smooth detested parasites Courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears You fools of fortune trencherfriends times flies Capandknee slaves vapours and minutejacks Of man and beast the infinite malady Crust you quite oer They stand What dost thou go Soft Take thy physic first thou too and thou Stay I will lend thee money borrow none He attacks them and forces them out What all in motion Henceforth be no feast Whereat a villains not a welcome guest Burn house Sink Athens Henceforth hated be Of Timon man and all humanity Exit Enter Timons Friends the Senators with other Lords FIRST FRIEND How now my lords SECOND FRIEND Know you the quality of Lord Timons fury THIRD FRIEND Push Did you see my cap FOURTH FRIEND I have lost my gown FIRST FRIEND Hes but a mad lord and nought but humours sways him He gave me a jewel th other day and now he has beat it out of my hat Did you see my jewel THIRD FRIEND Did you see my cap SECOND FRIEND Here tis FOURTH FRIEND Here lies my gown FIRST FRIEND Lets make no stay SECOND FRIEND Lord Timons mad THIRD FRIEND I feelt upon my bones FOURTH FRIEND One day he gives us diamonds next day stones Exeunt ACT IV SCENE I Without the walls of Athens Enter Timon TIMON Let me look back upon thee O thou wall That girdles in those wolves dive in the earth And fence not Athens Matrons turn incontinent Obedience fail in children Slaves and fools Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench And minister in their steads To general filths Convert o th instant green virginity Dot in your parents eyes Bankrupts hold fast Rather than render back out with your knives And cut your trusters throats Bound servants steal Largehanded robbers your grave masters are And pill by law Maid to thy masters bed Thy mistress is o th brothel Son of sixteen Pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire With it beat out his brains Piety and fear Religion to the gods peace justice truth Domestic awe nightrest and neighbourhood Instruction manners mysteries and trades Degrees observances customs and laws Decline to your confounding contraries And let confusion live Plagues incident to men Your potent and infectious fevers heap On Athens ripe for stroke Thou cold sciatica Cripple our senators that their limbs may halt As lamely as their manners Lust and liberty Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth That gainst the stream of virtue they may strive And drown themselves in riot Itches blains Sow all th Athenian bosoms and their crop Be general leprosy Breath infect breath That their society as their friendship may Be merely poison Nothing Ill bear from thee But nakedness thou detestable town Take thou that too with multiplying bans Timon will to the woods where he shall find Th unkindest beast more kinder than mankind The gods confoundhear me you good gods all Th Athenians both within and out that wall And grant as Timon grows his hate may grow To the whole race of mankind high and low Amen Exit SCENE II Athens A room in Timons house Enter Flavius with two or three Servants FIRST SERVANT Hear you Master Steward wheres our master Are we undone cast off nothing remaining FLAVIUS Alack my fellows what should I say to you Let me be recorded by the righteous gods I am as poor as you FIRST SERVANT Such a house broke So noble a master falln All gone and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm And go along with him SECOND SERVANT As we do turn our backs From our companion thrown into his grave So his familiars to his buried fortunes Slink all away leave their false vows with him Like empty purses picked and his poor self A dedicated beggar to the air With his disease of allshunned poverty Walks like contempt aloneMore of our fellows Enter other Servants FLAVIUS All broken implements of a ruined house THIRD SERVANT Yet do our hearts wear Timons livery That see I by our faces We are fellows still Serving alike in sorrow Leaked is our bark And we poor mates stand on the dying deck Hearing the surges threat We must all part Into this sea of air FLAVIUS Good fellows all The latest of my wealth Ill share amongst you Wherever we shall meet for Timons sake Lets yet be fellows Lets shake our heads and say As twere a knell unto our masters fortune We have seen better days Let each take some Offering them money Nay put out all your hands Not one word more Thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor They embrace and part several ways O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt Since riches point to misery and contempt Who would be so mocked with glory or to live But in a dream of friendship To have his pomp and all what state compounds But only painted like his varnished friends Poor honest lord brought low by his own heart Undone by goodness Strange unusual blood When mans worst sin is he does too much good Who then dares to be half so kind again For bounty that makes gods does still mar men My dearest lord blessed to be most accursed Rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes Are made thy chief afflictions Alas kind lord Hes flung in rage from this ingrateful seat Of monstrous friends Nor has he with him to supply his life Or that which can command it Ill follow and inquire him out Ill ever serve his mind with my best will Whilst I have gold Ill be his steward still Exit SCENE III Woods and caves near the seashore Enter Timon in the woods TIMON O blessed breeding sun draw from the earth Rotten

suns to borrow of ALCIBIADES Noble Timon What friendship may I do thee TIMON None but to maintain my opinion ALCIBIADES What is it Timon TIMON Promise me friendship but perform none If thou wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art a man If thou dost perform confound thee for thou art a man ALCIBIADES I have heard in some sort of thy miseries TIMON Thou sawst them when I had prosperity

I am sick at heart BARNARDO Have you had quiet guard FRANCISCO Not a mouse stirring BARNARDO Well good night If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus The rivals of my watch bid them make haste Enter

soldier who hath relievd you FRANCISCO Barnardo has my place Give you goodnight Exit MARCELLUS Holla Barnardo BARNARDO Say what is Horatio there HORATIO A piece of him BARNARDO Welcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus MARCELLUS What has this thing appeard again tonight BARNARDO I have seen nothing MARCELLUS Horatio says tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it HORATIO Tush tush twill not appear BARNARDO Sit down awhile And let us once again assail your ears That are so fortified against our story What we two nights have seen HORATIO Well sit we down And let us hear Barnardo speak of this BARNARDO Last night of all When yond same star thats westward from the pole Had made his course tillume that part of heaven Where now it burns Marcellus and myself The bell then beating one MARCELLUS Peace break thee off Look where it comes again Enter Ghost BARNARDO In the same figure like the King thats dead MARCELLUS Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio BARNARDO Looks it not like the King Mark it Horatio HORATIO Most like It harrows me with fear and wonder BARNARDO It would be spoke to MARCELLUS Question it Horatio HORATIO What art thou that usurpst this time of night Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march By heaven I charge thee speak MARCELLUS It is offended BARNARDO See it stalks away HORATIO Stay speak speak I charge thee speak Exit Ghost MARCELLUS Tis gone and will not answer BARNARDO How now Horatio You tremble and look pale Is not this something more than fantasy What think you ont HORATIO Before my God I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes MARCELLUS Is it not like the King HORATIO As thou art to thyself Such was the very armour he had on When he thambitious Norway combated So frownd he once when in an angry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice Tis strange MARCELLUS Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch HORATIO In what particular thought to work I know not But in the gross and scope of my opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our state MARCELLUS Good now sit down and tell me he that knows Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week What might be toward that this sweaty haste Doth make the night jointlabourer with the day Who ist that can inform me HORATIO That can I At least the whisper goes so Our last King Whose image even but now appeard to us Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride Dard to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet For so this side of our known world esteemd him Did slay this Fortinbras who by a seald compact Well ratified by law and heraldry Did forfeit with his life all those his lands Which he stood seizd of to the conqueror Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our King which had returnd To the inheritance of Fortinbras Had he been vanquisher as by the same covnant And carriage of the article designd His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras Of unimproved mettle hot and full Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes For food and diet to some enterprise That hath a stomach int which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to recover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands So by his father lost And this I take it Is the main motive of our preparations The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this posthaste and rummage in the land BARNARDO I think it be no other but een so Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King That was and is the question of these wars HORATIO A mote it is to trouble the minds eye In the most high and palmy state of Rome A little ere the mightiest Julius fell The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood Disasters in the sun and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse And even the like precurse of fierce events As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen Reenter Ghost But soft behold Lo where it comes again Ill cross it though it blast me Stay illusion If thou hast any sound or use of voice Speak to me If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me Speak to me If thou art privy to thy countrys fate Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth For which they say you spirits oft walk in death Speak of it Stay and speak The cock crows Stop it Marcellus MARCELLUS Shall I strike at it with my partisan HORATIO Do if it will not stand BARNARDO Tis here HORATIO Tis here Exit Ghost MARCELLUS Tis gone We do it wrong being so majestical To offer it the show of violence For it is as the air invulnerable And our vain blows malicious mockery BARNARDO It was about to speak when the cock crew HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons I have heard The cock that is the trumpet to the morn Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat Awake the god of day and at his warning Whether in sea or fire in earth or air Thextravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine And of the truth herein This present object made probation MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock Some say that ever gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated The bird of dawning singeth all night long And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad The nights are wholesome then no planets strike No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm So hallowd and so gracious is the time HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it But look the morn in russet mantle clad Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill Break we our watch up and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet for upon my life This spirit dumb to us will speak to him Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it As needful in our loves fitting our duty MARCELLUS Lets dot I pray and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently Exeunt SCENE II Elsinore A room of state in the Castle Enter Claudius King of Denmark Gertrude the Queen Hamlet Polonius Laertes Voltemand Cornelius Lords and Attendant KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death The memory be green and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves Therefore our sometime sister now our queen Thimperial jointress to this warlike state Have we as twere with a defeated joy With one auspicious and one dropping eye With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage In equal scale weighing delight and dole Taken to wife nor have we herein barrd Your better wisdoms which have freely gone With this affair along For all our thanks Now follows that you know young Fortinbras Holding a weak supposal of our worth Or thinking by our late dear brothers death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame Colleagued with this dream of his advantage He hath not faild to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father with all bonds of law To our most valiant brother So much for him Now for ourself and for this time of meeting Thus much the business is we have here writ To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears Of this his nephews purpose to suppress His further gait herein in that the levies The lists and full proportions are all made Out of his subject and we here dispatch You good Cornelius and you Voltemand For bearers of this greeting to old Norway Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow Farewell and let your haste commend your duty CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND In that and all things will we show our duty KING We doubt it nothing heartily farewell Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius And now Laertes whats the news with you You told us of some suit What ist Laertes You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes That shall not be my offer not thy asking The head is not more native to the heart The hand more instrumental to the mouth Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father What wouldst thou have Laertes LAERTES Dread my lordYour leave and favour to return to France From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation Yet now I must confess that duty done My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon KING Have you your fathers leave What says Polonius POLONIUS He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition and at last Upon his will I seald my hard consent I do beseech you give him leave to go KING Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine And thy best graces spend it at thy will But now my cousin Hamlet and my son HAMLET Aside A little more than kin and less than kind KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you HAMLET Not so my lord I am too much i the sun QUEEN Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust Thou knowst tis common all that lives must die Passing through nature to eternity HAMLET Ay madam it is common QUEEN If it be Why seems it so particular with thee HAMLET Seems madam Nay it is I know not seems Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother Nor customary suits of solemn black Nor windy suspiration of forcd breath No nor the fruitful river in the eye Nor the dejected haviour of the visage Together with all forms moods shows of grief That can denote me truly These indeed seem For they are actions that a man might play But I have that within which passeth show These but the trappings and the suits of woe KING Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet To give these mourning duties to your father But you must know your father lost a father That father lost lost his and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow But to persevere In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness Tis unmanly grief It shows a will most incorrect to heaven A heart unfortified a mind impatient An understanding simple and unschoold For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaven A fault against the dead a fault to nature To reason most absurd whose common theme Is death of fathers and who still hath cried From the first corse till he that died today This must be so We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe and think of us As of a father for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg It is most retrograde to our desire And we beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son QUEEN Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you madam KING Why tis a loving and a fair reply Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come This gentle and unforcd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof No jocund health that Denmark drinks today But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell And the Kings rouse the heaven shall bruit again Respeaking earthly thunder Come away Exeunt all but Hamlet HAMLET O that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew Or that the Everlasting had not fixd His canon gainst selfslaughter O God O God How weary stale flat and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world Fie ont Oh fie tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely That it should come to this But two months deadnay not so much not two So excellent a king that was to this Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth Must I remember Why she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on and yet within a month Let me not think ontFrailty thy name is woman A little month or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor fathers body Like Niobe all tearsWhy she even she O God A beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mournd longermarried with mine uncle My fathers brother but no more like my father Than I to Hercules Within a month Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes She married O most wicked speed to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets It is not nor it cannot come to good But break my heart for I must hold my tongue Enter Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo HORATIO Hail to your lordship HAMLET I am glad to see you well Horatio or I do forget myself HORATIO The same my lord And your poor servant ever HAMLET Sir my good friend Ill change that name with you And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio Marcellus MARCELLUS My good lord HAMLET I am very glad to see youGood even sir But what in faith make you from Wittenberg HORATIO A truant disposition good my lord HAMLET I would not hear your enemy say so Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself I know you are no truant But what is your affair in Elsinore Well teach you to drink deep ere you depart HORATIO My lord I came to see your fathers funeral HAMLET I prithee do not mock me fellowstudent I think it was to see my mothers wedding HORATIO Indeed my lord it followd hard upon HAMLET Thrift thrift Horatio The funeral bakd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day Horatio My fathermethinks I see my father HORATIO Where my lord HAMLET In my minds eye Horatio HORATIO I saw him once he was a goodly king HAMLET He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon his like again HORATIO My lord I think I saw him yesternight HAMLET Saw Who HORATIO My lord the King your father HAMLET The King my father HORATIO Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you HAMLET For Gods love let me hear HORATIO Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus and Barnardo on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night Been thus encounterd A figure like your father Armed at point exactly cappie Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd By their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes Within his truncheons length whilst they distilld Almost to jelly with the act of fear Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did And I with them the third night kept the watch Where as they had deliverd both in time Form of the thing each word made true and good The apparition comes I knew your father These hands are not more like HAMLET But where was this MARCELLUS My lord upon the platform where we watch HAMLET Did you not speak to it HORATIO My lord I did But answer made it none yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion like as it would speak But even then the morning cock crew loud And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanishd from our sight HAMLET Tis very strange HORATIO As I do live my honourd lord tis true And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it HAMLET Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me Hold you the watch tonight MARCELLUS and BARNARDO We do my lord HAMLET Armd say you Both Armd my lord HAMLET From top to toe BOTH My lord from head to foot HAMLET Then saw you not his face HORATIO O yes my lord he wore his beaver up HAMLET What lookd he frowningly HORATIO A countenance more in sorrow than in anger HAMLET Pale or red HORATIO Nay very pale HAMLET And fixd his eyes upon you HORATIO Most constantly HAMLET I would I had been there HORATIO It would have much amazd you HAMLET Very like very like Stayd it long HORATIO While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred MARCELLUS and BARNARDO Longer longer HORATIO Not when I sawt HAMLET His beard was grizzled no HORATIO It was as I have seen it in his life A sable silverd HAMLET I will watch tonight Perchance twill walk again HORATIO I warrant you it will HAMLET If it assume my noble fathers person Ill speak to it though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace I pray you all If you have hitherto conceald this sight Let it be tenable in your silence still And whatsoever else shall hap tonight Give it an understanding but no tongue I will requite your loves So fare ye well Upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve Ill visit you ALL Our duty to your honour HAMLET Your loves as mine to you farewell Exeunt Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo My fathers spirit in arms All is not well I doubt some foul play would the night were come Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes Exit SCENE III A room in Poloniuss house Enter Laertes and Ophelia LAERTES My necessaries are embarkd Farewell And sister as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant do not sleep But let me hear from you OPHELIA Do you doubt that LAERTES For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood A violet in the youth of primy nature Forward not permanent sweet not lasting The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more OPHELIA No more but so LAERTES Think it no more For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will but you must fear His greatness weighd his will is not his own For he himself is subject to his birth He may not as unvalud persons do Carve for himself for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of this whole state And therefore must his choice be circumscribd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open To his unmasterd importunity Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sisterAnd keep you in the rear of your affection Out of the shot and danger of desire The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosd And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent Be wary then best safety lies in fear Youth to itself rebels though none else near OPHELIA I shall theffect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart But good my brother Do not as some ungracious pastors do Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whilst like a puffd and reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede LAERTES O fear me not I stay too long But here my father comes Enter Polonius A double blessing is a double grace Occasion smiles upon a second leave POLONIUS Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayd for There my blessing with you Laying his hand on Laertess head And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue Nor any unproportiond thought his act Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each newhatchd unfledgd comrade Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but being in Beart that thopposed may beware of thee Give every man thine ear but few thy voice Take each mans censure but reserve thy judgement Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy But not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that Neither a borrower nor a lender be For loan oft loses both itself and friend And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry This above all to thine own self be true And it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not then be false to any man Farewell my blessing season this in thee LAERTES Most humbly do I take my leave my lord POLONIUS The time invites you go your servants tend LAERTES Farewell Ophelia and remember well What I have said to you OPHELIA Tis in my memory lockd And you yourself shall keep the key of it LAERTES Farewell Exit POLONIUS What ist Ophelia he hath said to you OPHELIA So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet POLONIUS Marry well bethought Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous If it be soas so tis put on me And that in way of cautionI must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour What is between you Give me up the truth OPHELIA He hath my lord of late made many tenders Of his affection to me POLONIUS Affection Pooh You speak like a green girl Unsifted in such perilous circumstance Do you believe his tenders as you call them OPHELIA I do not know my lord what I should think POLONIUS Marry Ill teach you think yourself a baby That you have taen these tenders for true pay Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly Ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase Running it thusyoull tender me a fool OPHELIA My lord he hath importund me with love In honourable fashion POLONIUS Ay fashion you may call it go to go to OPHELIA And hath given countenance to his speech my lord With almost all the holy vows of heaven POLONIUS Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know When the blood burns how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter Giving more light than heat extinct in both Even in their promise as it is amaking You must not take for fire From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet Believe so much in him that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you In few Ophelia Do not believe his vows for they are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show But mere implorators of unholy suits Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds The better to beguile This is for all I would not in plain terms from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet Look tot I charge you come your ways OPHELIA I shall obey my lord Exeunt SCENE IV The platform Enter Hamlet Horatio and Marcellus HAMLET The air bites shrewdly it is very cold HORATIO It is a nipping and an eager air HAMLET What hour now HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve MARCELLUS No it is struck HORATIO Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk A flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within What does this mean my lord HAMLET The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge HORATIO Is it a custom HAMLET Ay marry ist And to my mind though I am native here And to the manner born it is a custom More honourd in the breach than the observance This heavyheaded revel east and west Makes us traducd and taxd of other nations They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition and indeed it takes From our achievements though performd at height The pith and marrow of our attribute So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them As in their birth wherein they are not guilty Since nature cannot choose his origin By their oergrowth of some complexion Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason Or by some habit that too much oerleavens The form of plausive mannersthat these men Carrying I say the stamp of one defect Being Natures livery or Fortunes star His virtues elsebe they as pure as grace As infinite as man may undergo Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal HORATIO Look my lord it comes Enter Ghost HAMLET Angels and ministers of grace defend us Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable Thou comst in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee Ill call thee Hamlet King father royal Dane O answer me Let me not burst in ignorance but tell Why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd Hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again What may this mean That thou dead corse again in complete steel Revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon Making night hideous and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls Say why is this Wherefore What should we do Ghost beckons Hamlet HORATIO It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment did desire To you alone MARCELLUS Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground But do not go with it HORATIO No by no means HAMLET It will not speak then will I follow it HORATIO Do not my lord HAMLET Why what should be the fear I do not set my life at a pins fee And for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing immortal as itself It waves me forth again Ill follow it HORATIO What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles oer his base into the sea And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness Think of it The very place puts toys of desperation Without more motive into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath HAMLET It waves me still Go on Ill follow thee MARCELLUS You shall not go my lord HAMLET Hold off your hands HORATIO Be ruld you shall not go HAMLET My fate cries out And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lions nerve Ghost beckons Still am I calld Unhand me gentlemen Breaking free from them By heaven Ill make a ghost of him that lets me I say awayGo on Ill follow thee Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet HORATIO He waxes desperate with imagination MARCELLUS Lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him HORATIO Have after To what issue will this come MARCELLUS Something is rotten in the state of Denmark HORATIO Heaven"

confronted thus and for the extent Of legal justice used in such contempt My lords you know as know the mightful gods However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the peoples ears there naught hath passed But even with law against the wilful sons Of old Andronicus And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks His fits his frenzy and his bitterness And now he writes to heaven for his redress See heres to Jove and this to Mercury This to Apollo this to the god of war Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome Whats this but libelling against the senate And blazoning our injustice everywhere A goodly humour is it not my lords As who would say in Rome no justice were But if I live his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus health whom if she sleep Hell so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proudst conspirator that lives TAMORA My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine Lord of my life commander of my thoughts Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus age Th effects of sorrow for his valiant sons Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts Aside Why thus it shall become Highwitted Tamora to gloze with all But Titus I have touched

SATURNINUS Despiteful and intolerable wrongs Shall I endure this monstrous villainy I know from whence this same device proceeds May this be borne as if his traitorous sons That died by law for murder of our brother Have by my means been butchered wrongfully Go drag the villain hither by the hair Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege For this proud mock Ill be thy slaughterman Sly frantic wretch that holpst to make me great In hope thyself should govern Rome and me Enter Aemilius What news with thee Aemilius AEMILIUS Arm my lord Rome never had more cause The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of highresolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus did SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often overheard them say When I have walked like a private man That Lucius banishment was wrongfully And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor I will enchant the old AndronicusWith words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep Whenas the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feed SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us TAMORA If Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue to Aemilius Go thou before be our ambassador Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his fathers house the old Andronicus SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him best AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually Exit TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devices SATURNINUS Then go successantly and plead to him Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Plains near Rome Enter Lucius with an army of Goths with drums and soldiers LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us Well follow where thou leadst Like stinging bees in hottest summers day Led by their master to the flowered fields And be avenged on cursed Tamora GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his Child in his arms SECOND GOTH Renowned Lucius from our troops I strayed To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controlled with this discourse Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dame Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mothers look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milkwhite They never do beget a coalblack calf Peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the empress babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake With this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him Surprised him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robbed Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleased your empress eye And heres the base fruit of her burning lust Say walleyed slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiendlike face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl A sight to vex the fathers soul withal Get me a ladder A ladder is brought which Aaron is made to ascend AARON Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the empress If thou do this Ill show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall Ill speak no more but Vengeance rot you all LUCIUS Say on and if it please me which thou speakst Thy child shall live and I will see it nourished AARON And if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously performed And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believst no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath AARON What if I do not As indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that Ill urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god what god soeer it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover naught to thee LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will AARON First know thou I begot him on the empress LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sisters tongue and ravished her And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest LUCIUS O detestable villain callst thou that trimming AARON Why she was washed and cut and trimmed and twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learned of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mentioned Confederate with the queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief int I played the cheater for thy fathers hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons heads Beheld his tears and laughed so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the empress of this sport She sounded almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses GOTH What canst thou say all this and

have demeaned themselves Like men born to renown by life or death Three times did Richard make a lane to me And thrice cried Courage father fight it out And full as oft came Edward to my side With purple falchion painted to the hilt In blood of those that had encountered him And when the hardiest warriors did retire Richard cried Charge and give no foot of ground And cried A crown or else a glorious tomb A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre With this we charged again but out alas We budged again as I have seen a swan With bootless labour swim against the tide And spend her strength with

heaven Scorning whateer you can afflict me with Why come you not What multitudes and fear CLIFFORD So cowards fight when they can fly no further So doves do peck the falcons piercing talons So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives Breathe out invectives gainst the officers YORK O Clifford but bethink thee once again And in thy thought oerrun my former time And if thou canst for blushing view this face And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this CLIFFORD I will not bandy with thee word for word But buckle with thee blows twice two for one QUEEN MARGARET Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitors life Wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland NORTHUMBERLAND Hold Clifford do not honour him so much To prick thy finger though to wound his heart What valour were it when a cur doth grin For one to thrust his hand between his teeth When he might spurn him with his foot away

struggle in the net York is taken prisoner YORK So triumph thieves upon their conquered booty So true men yield with robbers so oermatched NORTHUMBERLAND What would your Grace have done unto him now QUEEN MARGARET Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland Come make him stand upon this molehill here That raught at mountains with outstretched arms Yet parted but the shadow with his hand What was it you that would be Englands king Was t you that revelled in our parliamentAnd made a preachment of your high descent Where are your mess of sons to back you now The wanton Edward and the lusty George And wheres that valiant crookback prodigy Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland Look York I stained this napkin with the blood That valiant Clifford with his rapiers point Made issue from the bosom of the boy And if thine eyes can water for his death I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly I should lament thy miserable state I prithee grieve to make me merry York Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance What hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutlands death Why art thou patient man Thou shouldst be mad And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance Thou wouldst be feed I see to make me sport York cannot speak unless he wear a crown A crown for York And lords bow low to him Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on Putting a paper crown on his head Ay marry sir now looks he like a king Ay this is he that took King Henrys chair And this is he was his adopted heir But how is it that great Plantagenet Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath As I bethink me you should not be king Till our King Henry had shook hands with Death And will you pale your head in Henrys glory And rob his temples of the diadem Now in his life against your holy oath O tis a fault too too unpardonable Off with the crown and with the crown his head And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead CLIFFORD That is my office for my fathers sake QUEEN MARGARET Nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes YORK Shewolf of France but worse than wolves of France Whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth How illbeseeming is it in thy sex To triumph like an Amazonian trull Upon their woes whom Fortune captivates But that thy face is vizardlike unchanging Made impudent with use of evil deeds I would assay proud queen to make thee blush To tell thee whence thou camst of whom derived Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless Thy father bears the type of King of Naples Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen Unless the adage must be verified That beggars mounted run their horse to death Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud But God he knows thy share thereof is small Tis virtue that doth make them most admired The contrary doth make thee wondered at Tis government that makes them seem divine The want thereof makes thee abominable Thou art as opposite to every good As the Antipodes are unto us Or as the south to the Septentrion O tigers heart wrapped in a womans hide How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child To bid the father wipe his eyes withal And yet be seen to bear a womans face Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless Bidst thou me rage Why now thou hast thy wish Wouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will For raging wind blows up incessant showers And when the rage allays the rain begins These tears are my sweet Rutlands obsequies And every drop cries vengeance for his death Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman NORTHUMBERLAND Beshrew me but his passion moves me so That hardly can I check my eyes from tears YORK That face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touched would not have stained with blood But you are more inhuman more inexorable O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania See ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears This cloth thou dippedst in blood of my sweet boy And I with tears do wash the blood away Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this And if thou tellst the heavy story right Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears Yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears And say Alas it was a piteous deed There take the crown and with the crown my curse And in thy need such comfort come to thee As now I reap at thy too cruel hand Hardhearted Clifford take me from the world My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads NORTHUMBERLAND Had he been slaughterman to all my kin I should not for my life but weep with him To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul QUEEN MARGARET What weepingripe my Lord Northumberland Think but upon the wrong he did us all And that will quickly dry thy melting tears CLIFFORD Heres for my oath heres for my fathers death Stabbing him QUEEN MARGARET And heres to right our gentlehearted king Stabbing him YORK Open thy gate of mercy gracious God My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee Dies QUEEN MARGARET Off with his head and set it on York gates So York may overlook the town of York Flourish Exeunt ACT II SCENE I A plain near Mortimers Cross in Herefordshire A march Enter Edward and Richard and their power EDWARD I wonder how our princely father scaped Or whether he be scaped away or no From Cliffords and Northumberlands pursuit Had he been taen we should have heard the news Had he been slain we should have heard the news Or had he scaped methinks we should have heard The happy tidings of his good escape How fares my brother Why is he so sad RICHARD I cannot joy until I be resolved Where our right valiant father is become I saw him in the battle range about And watched him how he singled Clifford forth Methought he bore him in the thickest troop As doth a lion in a herd of neat Or as a bear encompassed round with dogs Who having pinched a few and made them cry The rest stand all aloof and bark at him So fared our father with his enemies So fled his enemies my warlike father Methinks tis pride enough to be his son See how the morning opes her golden gates And takes her farewell of the glorious sun How well resembles it the prime of youth Trimmed like a younker prancing to his love EDWARD Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns RICHARD Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun Not separated with the racking clouds But severed in a pale clearshining sky See see they join embrace and seem to kiss As if they vowed some league inviolable Now are they but one lamp one light one sun In this the heaven figures some event EDWARD Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of I think it cites us brother to the field That we the sons of brave Plantagenet Each one already blazing by our meeds Should notwithstanding join our lights together And overshine the earth as this the world Whateer it bodes henceforward will I bear Upon my target three fair shining suns RICHARD Nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it

When as the noble Duke of York was slain Your princely father and my loving lord EDWARD O speak no more for I have heard too much RICHARD Say how he died for I will hear it all MESSENGER Environed he was with many foes And stood against them as the hope of Troy Against the Greeks that would have entered Troy But Hercules himself must yield to odds And many strokes though with a little axe Hews down and fell the hardesttimbered oak By many hands your father was subdued But only slaughtered by the ireful arm Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite Laughed in his face and when with grief he wept The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain And after many

NERISSA her waitingwoman JESSICA daughter to Shylock Magnificoes of Venice Officers of the Court of Justice a Gaoler Servants and other Attendants SCENE Partly at Venice and partly at Belmont the seat of Portia on the Continent ACT I SCENE I Venice A street Enter Antonio Salarino and Solanio ANTONIO In sooth I know not why I am so sad It wearies me you say it wearies you But how I caught it found it or came by it What stuff tis made of whereof it is born I am to learn And such a wantwit sadness makes of me That I have much ado to know myself SALARINO Your mind is tossing on the ocean There where your argosies with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood Or as it were the pageants of the sea Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them do them reverence As they fly by them with their woven wings SOLANIO Believe me sir had I such venture forth The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad SALARINO My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea I should not see the sandy hourglass run But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew dockd in sand Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks Which touching but my gentle vessels side Would scatter all her spices on the stream Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks And in a word but even now worth this And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought To think on this and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechancd would make me sad But tell not me I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise ANTONIO Believe me no I thank my fortune for it My ventures are not in one bottom trusted Nor to one place nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad SALARINO Why then you are in love ANTONIO Fie fie SALARINO Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry and twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad Now by twoheaded Janus Nature hath framd strange fellows in her time Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper And other of such vinegar aspect That theyll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable Enter Bassanio Lorenzo and Gratiano SOLANIO Here comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman Gratiano and Lorenzo Fare ye well We leave you now with better company SALARINO I would have stayd till I had made you merry If worthier friends had not prevented me ANTONIO Your worth is very dear in my regard I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th occasion to depart SALARINO Good morrow my good lords BASSANIO Good signiors both when shall we laugh Say when You grow exceeding strange Must it be so SALARINO Well make our leisures to attend on yours Exeunt Salarino and Solanio LORENZO My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio We two will leave you but at dinnertime I pray you have in mind where we must meet BASSANIO I will not fail you GRATIANO You look not well Signior Antonio You have too much respect upon the world They lose it that do buy it with much care Believe me you are marvellously changd ANTONIO I hold the world but as the world Gratiano A stage where every man must play a part And mine a sad one GRATIANO Let me play the fool With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster Sleep when he wakes And creep into the jaundice By being peevish I tell thee what Antonio I love thee and tis my love that speaks There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond And do a wilful stillness entertain With purpose to be dressd in an opinion Of wisdom gravity profound conceit As who should say I am Sir Oracle And when I ope my lips let no dog bark O my Antonio I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing when I am very sure If they should speak would almost damn those ears Which hearing them would call their brothers fools Ill tell thee more of this another time But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon this opinion Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well a while Ill end my exhortation after dinner LORENZO Well we will leave you then till dinnertime I must be one of these same dumb wise men For Gratiano never lets me speak GRATIANO Well keep me company but two years moe Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue ANTONIO Fare you well Ill grow a talker for this gear GRATIANO Thanks i faith for silence is only commendable In a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo ANTONIO Is that anything now BASSANIO Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search ANTONIO Well tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you today promisd to tell me of BASSANIO Tis not unknown to you Antonio How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance Nor do I now make moan to be abridgd From such a noble rate but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gagd To you Antonio I owe the most in money and in love And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe ANTONIO I pray you good Bassanio let me know it And if it stand as you yourself still do Within the eye of honour be assurd My purse my person my extremest means Lie all unlockd to your occasions BASSANIO In my schooldays when I had lost one shaft I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advised watch To find the other forth and by adventuring both I oft found both I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence I owe you much and like a wilful youth That which I owe is lost But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt As I will watch the aim or to find both Or bring your latter hazard back again And thankfully rest debtor for the first ANTONIO You know me well and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done And I am prest unto it Therefore speak BASSANIO In Belmont is a lady richly left And she is fair and fairer than that word Of wondrous virtues Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages Her name is Portia nothing undervalud To Catos daughter Brutus Portia Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos strond And many Jasons come in quest of her O my Antonio had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate ANTONIO Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do That shall be rackd even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia Go presently inquire and so will I Where money is and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake Exeunt SCENE II Belmont A room in Portias house Enter Portia with her waitingwoman Nerissa PORTIA By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world NERISSA You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are And yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean Superfluity come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer PORTIA Good sentences and well pronouncd NERISSA They would be better if well followed PORTIA If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces It is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband O me the word choose I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbd by the will of a dead father Is it not hard Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse noneNERISSA Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations Therefore the lottry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come PORTIA I pray thee overname them and as thou namest them I will describe them and according to my description level at my affection NERISSA First there is the Neapolitan prince PORTIA Ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself I am much afeard my lady his mother playd false with a smith NERISSA Then is there the County Palatine PORTIA He doth nothing but frown as who should say And you will not have me choose He hears merry tales and smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be married to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth than to either of these God defend me from these two NERISSA How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon PORTIA God made him and therefore let him pass for a man In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the Neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine He is every man in no man If a throstle sing he falls straight acapring He will fence with his own shadow If I should marry him I should marry twenty husbands If he would despise me I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I shall never requite him NERISSA What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron of England PORTIA You know I say nothing to him for he understands not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English He is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse with a dumbshow How oddly he is suited I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his behaviour everywhere NERISSA What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour PORTIA That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his surety and seald under for another NERISSA How like you the young German the Duke of Saxonys nephew PORTIA Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast And the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall make shift to go without him NERISSA If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should refuse to accept him PORTIA Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without I know he will choose it I will do anything Nerissa ere I will be married to a sponge NERISSA You need not fear lady the having any of these lords They have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the caskets PORTIA If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my fathers will I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence And I pray God grant them a fair departure NERISSA Do you not remember lady in your fathers time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat PORTIA Yes yes it was Bassanio as I think so was he calld NERISSA True madam He of all the men that ever my foolish eyes lookd upon was the best deserving a fair lady PORTIA I remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy praise Enter a Servingman How now what news SERVINGMAN The four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave And there is a forerunner come from a fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight PORTIA If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his approach If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me Come Nerissa Sirrah go before Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door Exeunt SCENE III Venice A public place Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats well BASSANIO Ay sir for three months SHYLOCK For three months well BASSANIO For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound SHYLOCK Antonio shall become bound well BASSANIO May you stead me Will you pleasure me Shall I know your answer SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound BASSANIO Your answer to that SHYLOCK Antonio is a good man BASSANIO Have you heard any imputation to the contrary SHYLOCK Ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient Yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and other ventures he hath squandered abroad But ships are but boards sailors but men there be landrats and waterrats waterthieves and landthievesI mean piratesand then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks The man is notwithstanding sufficient Three thousand ducats I think I may take his bond BASSANIO Be assured you may SHYLOCK I will be assured I may And that I may be assured I will bethink me May I speak with Antonio BASSANIO If it please you to dine with us SHYLOCK Yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but I will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you What news on the Rialto Who is he comes here Enter Antonio BASSANIO This is Signior Antonio SHYLOCK Aside How like a fawning publican he looks I hate him for he is a Christian But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice If I can catch him once upon the hip I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him He hates our sacred nation and he rails Even there where merchants most do congregate On me my bargains and my wellwon thrift Which he calls interest Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him BASSANIO Shylock do you hear SHYLOCK I am debating of my present store And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats What of that Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe Will furnish me But soft how many months Do you desire To Antonio Rest you fair good signior Your worship was the last man in our mouths ANTONIO Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend Ill break a custom To Bassanio Is he yet possessd How much ye would SHYLOCK Ay ay three thousand ducats ANTONIO And for three months SHYLOCK I had forgot three months you told me so Well then your bond And let me see but hear you Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage ANTONIO I do never use it SHYLOCK When Jacob grazd his uncle Labans sheep This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf The third possessor ay he was the third ANTONIO And what of him Did he take interest SHYLOCK No not take interest not as you would say Directly interest mark what Jacob did When Laban and himself were compromisd That all the eanlings which were streakd and pied Should fall as Jacobs hire the ewes being rank In end of autumn turned to the rams And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act The skilful shepherd pilld me certain wands And in the doing of the deed of kind He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall particolourd lambs and those were Jacobs This was a way to thrive and he was blest And thrift is blessing if men steal it not ANTONIO This was a venture sir that Jacob servd for A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven Was this inserted to make interest good Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams SHYLOCK I cannot tell I make it breed as fast But note me signior ANTONIO Mark you this Bassanio The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek A goodly apple rotten at the heart O what a goodly outside falsehood hath SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats tis a good round sum Three months from twelve then let me see the rate ANTONIO Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you SHYLOCK Signior Antonio many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances Still have I borne it with a patient shrug For suffrance is the badge of all our tribe You call me misbeliever cutthroat dog And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine And all for use of that which is mine own Well then it now appears you need my help Go to then you come to me and you say Shylock we would have moneys You say so You that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold moneys is your suit What should I say to you Should I not say Hath a dog money Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats Or Shall I bend low and in a bondmans key With bated breath and whispring humbleness Say this Fair sir you spet on me on Wednesday last You spurnd me such a day another time You calld me dog and for these courtesies Ill lend you thus much moneys ANTONIO I am as like to call thee so again To spet on thee again to spurn thee too If thou wilt lend this money lend it not As to thy friends for when did friendship takeA breed for barren metal of his friend But lend it rather to thine enemy Who if he break thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty SHYLOCK Why look you how you storm I would be friends with you and have your love Forget the shames that you have staind me with Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys and youll not hear me This is kind I offer BASSANIO This were kindness SHYLOCK This kindness will I show Go with me to a notary seal me there Your single bond and in a merry sport If you repay me not on such a day In such a place such sum or sums as are Expressd in the condition let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me ANTONIO Content in faith Ill seal to such a bond And say there is much kindness in the Jew BASSANIO You shall not seal to such a bond for me Ill rather dwell in my necessity ANTONIO Why fear not man I will not forfeit it Within these two months thats a month before This bond expires I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond SHYLOCK O father Abram what these Christians are Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others Pray you tell me this If he should break his day what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture A pound of mans flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable profitable neither As flesh of muttons beefs or goats I say To buy his favour I extend this friendship If he will take it so If not adieu And for my love I pray you wrong me not ANTONIO Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond SHYLOCK Then meet me forthwith at the notarys Give him direction for this merry bond And I will go and purse the ducats straight See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave and presently Ill be with you ANTONIO Hie thee gentle Jew Exit Shylock This Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind BASSANIO I like not fair terms and a villains mind ANTONIO Come on in this there can be no dismay My ships

me by that means I told you Yourself renowned Prince then stood as fair As any comer I have lookd on yet For my affection PRINCE OF MOROCCO Even for that I thank you Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman I would oerstare the sternest eyes that look Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth Pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey To win thee lady But alas the while If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand So is Alcides beaten by his rage And so may I blind Fortune leading me Miss that which one unworthier may attain And die with grieving PORTIA You must take your chance And either not attempt to choose at all Or swear before you choose if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage Therefore be advisd PRINCE

practisd on me for thy use May it be possible that foreign hire Could out of thee extract one spark of evil That might annoy my finger Tis so strange That though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white my eye will scarcely see it Treason and murder ever kept together As two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them But thou gainst all proportion didst bring in Wonder to wait on treason and on murder And whatsoever cunning fiend it was That wrought upon thee so preposterously Hath got the voice in hell for excellence And other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches colours and with forms being fetchd From glistring semblances of piety But he that temperd thee bade

of France And let us do it with no show of fear No with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance For my good liege she is so idly kingd Her sceptre so fantastically borne By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth That fear attends her not CONSTABLE O peace Prince Dauphin You are too much mistaken in this king Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy How well supplied with noble counsellors How modest in exception and withal How terrible in constant resolution And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus Covering discretion with a coat of folly As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate DAUPHIN Well tis not so my Lord High Constable But though we think it so it is no matter In cases of defence tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems So the proportions of defence are filld Which of a weak and niggardly projection Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting A little cloth FRENCH KING Think we King Harry strong And Princes look you strongly arm to meet him The kindred of him hath been fleshd upon

the wormholes of longvanishd days Nor from the dust of old oblivion rakd He sends you this most memorable line In every branch truly demonstrative Willing you overlook this pedigree And when you find him evenly derivd From his most famd of famous ancestors Edward the Third he bids you then resign Your crown and kingdom indirectly held From him the native and true challenger FRENCH KING Or else

In your own losses if he stay in France FRENCH KING Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full Flourish EXETER Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay For

order give To sounds confusd behold the threaden sails Borne with the invisible and creeping wind Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowd sea Breasting the lofty surge O do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on the inconstant billows dancing For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy And leave your England as dead midnight still Guarded with grandsires babies and old women Either past or not arrivd to pith and puissance For who is he whose chin is but enrichd With one appearing hair that will not follow These culld and choicedrawn cavaliers to France Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege Behold the ordnance on their carriages With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back Tells Harry that the King doth offer him Katharine his daughter and with her to dowry Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms The offer likes not and the

Harfleur Alarum Enter King Henry Exeter Bedford Gloucester and Soldiers with scalingladders KING HENRY Once more unto the breach dear friends once more Or close the wall up with our English dead In peace theres nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility But when the blast of war blows in our ears Then imitate the action of the tiger Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood Disguise fair nature with hardfavourd rage Then lend the eye a terrible aspect Let it pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon let the brow oerwhelm it As fearfully as does a galled rock Oerhang and jutty his confounded base Swilld with the wild and wasteful ocean Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height On on you noblest English Whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof Fathers that like so many Alexanders Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathd their swords for lack of argument Dishonour not your mothers now attest That those whom you calld fathers did beget you Be copy now to men of grosser blood And teach them how to war And you good yeomen Whose limbs were made in England show us here The mettle of your pasture let us swear That you are worth your breeding which I doubt not For there is none of you so mean and base That hath not noble lustre in your eyes I see you stand like

young as I am I have observd these three swashers I am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man For Bardolph he is whiteliverd and redfacd by the means whereof a faces it out but fights not For Pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks words and keeps whole weapons For Nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a should be thought a coward But his few bad words are matchd with as few good deeds for a never broke any mans head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk They will steal anything and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lutecase bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three halfpence Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a fireshovel I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals They would have me as familiar with mens pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if I should take from anothers pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and seek some better service Their villainy goes against my weak stomach and therefore I must cast it up Exit Enter Gower and Fluellen GOWER Captain Fluellen you must come presently to the mines

destruction Defy us to our worst for as I am a soldier A name that in my thoughts becomes me best If I begin the battery once again I will not leave the halfachieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried The gates of mercy shall be all shut up And the fleshd soldier rough and hard of heart In liberty of bloody hand shall range With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flowring infants What is it then to me if impious War Arrayd in flames like to the prince of fiends Do with his smirchd complexion all fell feats Enlinkd to waste and desolation What ist to me when you yourselves are cause If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the leviathan To come ashore Therefore you men of Harfleur Take pity of your town and of your people Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace Oerblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder spoil and villainy If not why in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dashd to the walls Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confusd Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry At Herods bloodyhunting slaughtermen What say you Will you yield and this avoid Or guilty in defence be thus destroyd GOVERNOR Our expectation hath this day an end The Dauphin whom of succours we entreated Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege Therefore great King We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy Enter our gates dispose of us and ours For we no longer are defensible KING HENRY Open your gates Come uncle Exeter Go you and enter Harfleur there remain And fortify it strongly gainst the French Use mercy to them all For us dear uncle The winter coming on and sickness growing Upon our soldiers we will retire to Calais Tonight in

relate Speak of me as I am Nothing extenuate Nor set down aught in malice Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well Of one not easily jealous but being wrought Perplexd in the extreme of one whose hand Like the base Judean threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdud eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their

To glad your ear and please your eyes It hath been sung at festivals On embereves and holyales And lords and ladies in their lives Have read it for restoratives The purchase is to make men glorious Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius If you born in these latter times When wits more ripe accept my rhymes And that to hear an old man sing May to your wishes pleasure bring I life would wish and that I might Waste it for you like taperlight This Antioch then Antiochus the Great Built up this city for his chiefest seat The fairest in all Syria I tell you what mine authors say This king unto him took a fere Who died and left a female heir So buxom blithe and full of face As heaven had lent her all his grace With whom the father liking took And her to incest did provoke Bad child worse father to entice his own To evil should be done by none But custom what they did begin Was with long use accountd no sin The beauty of this sinful dame Made many princes thither frame To seek her as a bedfellow In marriage pleasures playfellow Which to prevent he made a law To keep her still and men in awe That whoso askd her for his wife His riddle told not lost his life So for her many a wight did die As yon grim looks do testify What now ensues to the judgement your eye I give my cause who best can justify Exit SCENE I Antioch A room in the palace Enter Antiochus Prince Pericles and followers ANTIOCHUS Young prince of Tyre you have at large received The danger of the task you undertake PERICLES I have Antiochus and with a soul Emboldened with the glory of her praise Think death no hazard in this enterprise ANTIOCHUS Music Bring in our daughter clothed like a bride For the embracements even of Jove himself At whose conception till Lucina reigned Nature this dowry gave to glad her presence The senate house of planets all did sit To knit in her their best perfections Music Enter the Daughter of Antiochus PERICLES See where she comes apparelld like the spring Graces her subjects and her thoughts the king Of every virtue gives renown to men Her face the book of praises where is read Nothing but curious pleasures as from thence Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath Could never be her mild companion You gods that made me man and sway in love That have inflamed desire in my breast To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree Or die in the adventure be my helps As I am son and servant to your will To compass such a boundless happiness ANTIOCHUS Prince Pericles PERICLES That would be son to great Antiochus ANTIOCHUS Before thee stands this fair Hesperides With golden fruit but dangerous to be touchd For deathlike dragons here affright thee hard Her face like heaven enticeth thee to view Her countless glory which desert must gain And which without desert because thine eye Presumes to reach all the whole heap must die Yon sometimes famous princes like thyself Drawn by report adventurous by desire Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale That without covering save yon field of stars Here they stand Martyrs slain in Cupids wars And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist For going on deaths net whom none resist PERICLES Antiochus I thank thee who hath taught My frail mortality to know itself And by those fearful objects to prepare This body like to them to what I must For death rememberd should be like a mirror Who tells us lifes but breath to trust it error Ill make my will then and as sick men do Who know the world see heaven but feeling woe Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did So I bequeath a happy peace to you And all good men as every prince should do My riches to the earth from whence they came To the daughter of Antiochus But my unspotted fire of love to you Thus ready for the way of life or death I wait the sharpest blow Antiochus ANTIOCHUS Scorning advice read the conclusion then Which read and not expounded tis decreed As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed DAUGHTER Of all ssayed yet mayst thou prove prosperous Of all ssayed yet I wish thee happiness PERICLES Like a bold champion I assume the lists Nor ask advice of any other thought But faithfulness and courage He reads the riddle I am no viper yet I feed On mothers flesh which did me breed I sought a husband in which labour I found that kindness in a father Hes father son and husband mild I mother wife and yet his child How they may be and yet in two As you will live resolve it you Sharp physic is the last but O you powers That give heaven countless eyes to view mens acts Why cloud they not their sights perpetually If this be true which makes me pale to read it Fair glass of light I loved you and could still Takes hold of the hand of the Princess Were not this glorious casket stored with ill But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt For hes no man on whom perfections wait That knowing sin within will touch the gate You are a fair viol and your sense the strings Who fingerd to make man his lawful music Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken But being playd upon before your time Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime Good sooth I care not for you ANTIOCHUS Prince Pericles touch not upon thy life For thats an article within our law As dangerous as the rest Your times expired Either expound now or receive your sentence PERICLES Great king Few love to hear the sins they love to act Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it Who has a book of all that monarchs do Hes more secure to keep it shut than shown For vice repeated is like the wandering wind Blows dust in others eyes to spread itself And yet the end of all is bought thus dear The breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear To stop the air would hurt them The blind mole casts Coppd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throngd By mans oppression and the poor worm doth die fort Kind are earths gods in vice their laws their will And if Jove stray who dares say Jove doth illIt is enough you know and it is fit What being more known grows worse to smother it All love the womb that their first bred Then give my tongue like leave to love my head ANTIOCHUS Aside Heaven that I had thy head He has found the meaning But I will gloze with himYoung prince of Tyre Though by the tenour of our strict edict Your exposition misinterpreting We might proceed to cancel of your days Yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree As your fair self doth tune us otherwise Forty days longer we do respite you If by which time our secret be undone This mercy shows well joy in such a son And until then your entertain shall be As doth befit our honour and your worth Exeunt all but Pericles PERICLES How courtesy would seem to cover sin When what is done is like an hypocrite The which is good in nothing but in sight If it be true that I interpret false Then were it certain you were not so bad As with foul incest to abuse your soul Where now youre both a father and a son By your untimely claspings with your child Which pleasures fits a husband not a father And she an eater of her mothers flesh By the defiling of her parents bed And both like serpents are who though they feed On sweetest flowers yet they poison breed Antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men Blush not in actions blacker than the night Will schew no course to keep them from the light One sin I know another doth provoke Murders as near to lust as flame to smoke Poison and treason are the hands of sin Ay and the targets to put off the shame Then lest my life be croppd to keep you clear By flight Ill shun the danger which I fear Exit Reenter Antiochus ANTIOCHUS He hath found the meaning For which we mean to have his head He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin In such a loathed manner And therefore instantly this prince must die For by his fall my honour must keep high Who attends us there Enter Thaliard THALIARD Doth your highness call ANTIOCHUS Thaliard you are of our chamber And our mind partakes her private actions To your secrecy and for your faithfulness We will advance you Thaliard Behold heres poison and heres gold We hate the prince of Tyre and thou must kill him It fits thee not to ask the reason why Because we bid it Say is it done THALIARD My lord tis done ANTIOCHUS Enough Enter a Messenger Let your breath cool yourself telling your haste MESSENGER My lord Prince Pericles is fled Exit ANTIOCHUS As thou wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot From a wellexperienced archer hits the mark His eye doth level at so thou neer return Unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead THALIARD My lord if I can get him within my pistols length Ill make him sure enough so farewell to your highness ANTIOCHUS Thaliard adieu Exit Thaliard Till Pericles be dead My heart can lend no succour to my head Exit SCENE II Tyre A room in the palace Enter Pericles with his Lords PERICLES To Lords without Let none disturb usWhy should this change of thoughts The sad companion dulleyed melancholy Be my so used a guest as not an hour In the days glorious walk or peaceful night The tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet Here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them And danger which I feard is at Antioch Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here Yet neither pleasures art can joy my spirits Nor yet the others distance comfort me Then it is thus the passions of the mind That have their first conception by misdread Have afternourishment and life by care And what was first but fear what might be done Grows elder now and cares it be not done And so with me the great Antiochus Gainst whom I am too little to contend Since hes so great can make his will his act Will think me speaking though I swear to silence Nor boots it me to say I honour him If he suspect I may dishonour him And what may make him blush in being known Hell stop the course by which it might be known With hostile forces hell oerspread the land And with the ostent of war will look so huge Amazement shall drive courage from the state Our men be vanquishd ere they do resist And subjects punishd that neer thought offence Which care of them not pity of myself Who am no more but as the tops of trees Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them Makes both my body pine and soul to languish And punish that before that he would punish Enter Helicanus with other Lords FIRST LORD Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast SECOND LORD And keep your mind till you return to us Peaceful and comfortable HELICANUS Peace peace and give experience tongue They do abuse the king that flatter him For flattery is the bellows blows up sin The thing the which is flatterd but a spark To which that spark gives heat and stronger glowing Whereas reproof obedient and in order Fits kings as they are men for they may err When Signior Sooth here does proclaim peace He flatters you makes war upon your life Prince pardon me or strike me if you please I cannot be much lower than my knees PERICLES All leave us else but let your cares oerlook What shipping and what ladings in our haven And then return to us Exeunt Lords Helicanus thou Hast moved us what seest thou in our looks HELICANUS An angry brow dread lord PERICLES If there be such a dart in princes frowns How durst thy tongue move anger to our face HELICANUS How dares the plants look up to heaven from whence They have their nourishment PERICLES Thou knowst I have power To take thy life from thee HELICANUS Kneeling I have ground the axe myself Do but you strike the blow PERICLES Rise prithee rise Sit down thou art no flatterer I thank thee for it and heaven forbid That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid Fit counsellor and servant for a prince Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant What wouldst thou have me do HELICANUS To bear with patience Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself PERICLES Thou speakst like a physician Helicanus That ministers a potion unto me That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself Attend me then I went to Antioch Where as thou knowst against the face of death I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty From whence an issue I might propagate Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder The resthark in thine earas black as incest Which by my knowledge found the sinful father Seemd not to strike but smooth but thou knowst this Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss Which fear so grew in me I hither fled Under the covering of a careful night Who seemd my good protector and being here Bethought me what was past what might succeed I knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears Decrease not but grow faster than the years And should he doubt as no doubt he doth That I should open to the listening air How many worthy princes bloods were shed To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope To lop that doubt hell fill this land with arms And make pretence of wrong that I have done him When all for mine if I may call offence Must feel wars blow who spares not innocence Which love to all of which thyself art one Who now reprovest me for it HELICANUS Alas sir PERICLES Drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks Musings into my mind with thousand doubts How I might stop this tempest ere it came And finding little comfort to relieve them I thought it princely charity to grieve them HELICANUS Well my lord since you have given me leave to speak Freely will I speak Antiochus you fear And justly too I think you fear the tyrant Who either by public war or private treason Will take away your life Therefore my lord go travel for a while Till that his rage and anger be forgot Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life Your rule direct to any if to me Day serves not light more faithful than Ill be PERICLES I do not doubt thy faith But should he wrong my liberties in my absence HELCANUS Well mingle our bloods together in the earth From whence we had our being and our birth PERICLES Tyre I now look from thee then and to Tarsus Intend my travel where Ill hear from thee And by whose letters Ill dispose myself The care I had and have of subjects good On thee I lay whose wisdoms strength can bear it Ill take thy word for faith not ask thine oath Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both But in our orbs well live so round and safe That time of both this truth shall neer convince Thou showdst a subjects shine I a true prince Exeunt SCENE III Tyre An antechamber in the Palace Enter Thaliard THALIARD So this is Tyre and this the court Here must I kill King Pericles and if I do it not I am sure to be hanged at home tis dangerous Well I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that being bid to ask what he would of the king desired he might know none of his secrets now do I see he had some reason fort for if a king bid a man be a villain hes bound by the indenture of his oath to be one Husht here come the lords of Tyre Enter Helicanus and Escanes with other Lords of Tyre HELICANUS You shall not need my fellow peers of Tyre Further to question me of your kings departure His seald commission left in trust with me Doth speak sufficiently hes gone to travel THALIARD Aside How the king gone HELICANUS If further yet you will be satisfied Why as it were unlicensed of your loves He would depart Ill give some light unto you Being at Antioch THALIARD Aside What from Antioch HELICANUS Royal Antiochuson what cause I know not Took some displeasure at him at least he judged so And doubting lest that he had errd or sinnd To show his sorrow hed correct himself So puts himself unto the shipmans toil With whom each minute threatens life or death THALIARD Aside Well I perceive I shall not be hangd now although I would But since hes gone the kings seas must please He scaped the land to perish at the sea Ill present myself Peace to the lords of Tyre HELICANUS Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome THALIARD From him I come With message unto princely Pericles But since my landing I have understood Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels My message must return from whence it came HELICANUS We have no reason to desire it Commended to our master not to us Yet ere you shall depart this we desire As friends to Antioch we may feast in Tyre Exeunt SCENE IV Tarsus A room in the Governors houseEnter Cleon the governor of Tarsus with Dionyza and others CLEON My Dionyza shall we rest us here And by relating tales of others griefs See if twill teach us to forget our own DIONYZA That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it For who digs hills because they do aspire Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher O my distressed lord even such our griefs are Here theyre but felt and seen with mischiefs eyes But like to groves being toppd they higher rise CLEON O Dionyza Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it Or can conceal his hunger till he famish Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep Our woes into the air our eyes do weep Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder That if heaven slumber while their creatures want They may awake their helps to comfort them Ill then discourse our woes felt several years And wanting breath to speak help me with tears DIONYZA Ill do my best sir CLEON This Tarsus oer which I have the government A city on whom plenty held full hand For riches strewd herself even in the streets Whose towers bore heads so high they kissd the clouds And strangers neer beheld but wonderd at Whose men and dames so jetted and adornd Like one anothers glass to trim them by Their tables were stored full to glad the sight And not so much to feed on as delight All poverty was scornd and pride so great The name of help grew odious to repeat DIONYZA O tis too true CLEON But see what heaven can do By this our change These mouths who but of late earth sea and air Were all too little to content and please Although they gave their creatures in abundance As houses are defiled for want of use They are now starved for want of exercise Those palates who not yet two summers younger Must have inventions to delight the taste Would now be glad of bread and beg for it Those mothers who to nousle up their babes Thought nought too curious are ready now To eat those little darlings whom they loved So sharp are hungers teeth that man and wife Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life Here stands a lord and there a lady weeping Here many sink yet those which see them fall Have scarce strength left to give them burial Is not this true DIONYZA Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it CLEON O let those cities that of plentys cup And her prosperities so largely taste With their superflous riots hear these tears The misery of Tarsus may be theirs Enter a Lord LORD Wheres the lord governor CLEON Here Speak out thy sorrows which thou bringst in haste For comfort is too far for us to expect LORD We have descried upon our neighbouring shore A portly sail of ships make hitherward CLEON I thought as much One sorrow never comes but brings an heir That may succeed as his inheritor And so in ours some neighbouring nation Taking advantage of our misery That stuffd the hollow vessels with their power To beat us down the which are down already And make a conquest of unhappy me Whereas no glorys got to overcome LORD Thats the least fear for by the semblance Of their white flags displayd they bring us peace And come to us as favourers not as foes CLEON Thou speakst like hims untutord to repeat Who makes the fairest show means most deceit But bring they what they will and what they can What need we fear The grounds the lowest and we are half way there Go tell their general we attend him here To know for what he comes and whence he comes And what he craves LORD I go my lord Exit CLEON Welcome is peace if he on peace consist If wars we are unable to resist Enter Pericles with Attendants PERICLES Lord governor for so we hear you are Let not our ships and number of our men Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes We have heard your miseries as far as Ty"

honour lay in me From me by strong assault it is bereft My honey lost and I a dronelike bee Have no perfection of my summer left But robbed and ransacked by injurious theft In thy weak hive a wandring wasp hath crept And sucked the honey which thy chaste bee kept Yet am I guilty of thy honours wrack Yet for thy honour did I entertain him Coming from thee I could not put him back For it had been dishonour to disdain him Besides of weariness he did complain him And talked of virtue O unlookedfor evil When virtue is profaned in such a devil Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts Or kings be breakers of their own behests But no perfection is so absolute That some impurity doth not pollute The aged man that coffers up his gold Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold But like stillpining Tantalus he sits And useless barns the harvest of his wits Having no other pleasure of his gain But torment that it cannot cure his pain So then he hath it when he cannot use it And leaves it to be mastered by his young

suppliants friend And bring him where his suit may be obtained When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chained Give physic to the sick ease to the

To stamp the seal of time in aged things To wake the morn and sentinel the night To wrong the wronger till he render right To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours And smear with dust their glittring golden towers To fill with wormholes stately monuments To feed oblivion with decay of things To blot old books and alter their contents To pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings To dry the old oaks sap and cherish springs To spoil antiquities of hammered steel And turn the giddy round of Fortunes wheel To show the beldam daughters of her daughter To make the child a man the man a child To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter To tame the unicorn and lion wild To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops And waste huge stones with little waterdrops Why workst thou mischief in thy pilgrimage Unless thou couldst return to make amends One poor retiring minute in an age Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends O this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight

own shadow let the thief run mad Himself himself seek every hour to kill Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill For who so base would such an office have As slandrous deathsman to so base a slave The baser is he coming from a king To shame his hope with deeds degenerate The mightier man the mightier is the thing That makes him honoured or begets him hate For greatest scandal waits on greatest state The moon being clouded presently is missed But little stars may hide them when they list The crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire And unperceived fly with the filth away But if the like the snowwhite swan desire The stain upon his silver down will stay Poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day Gnats are unnoted wheresoeer they fly But eagles gazed upon with every eye Out idle words servants to shallow fools Unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators Busy yourselves in skillcontending schools Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters To trembling clients be you mediators For me I force not argument a straw Since that my case is past the help of law In vain I rail at Opportunity At Time at Tarquin and uncheerful night In vain I cavil with mine infamy In vain I spurn at my confirmed despite This helpless smoke of words doth me no right The remedy indeed to do me good Is to let forth my foul defiled blood Poor hand why quiverst thou at this decree Honour thyself to rid me of this shame For if I die my honour lives in thee But if I live thou livst in my defame Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame And wast afeared to scratch her wicked foe Kill both thyself and her for yielding so This said from her betumbled couch she starteth To find some desprate instrument of death But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth To make more vent for passage of her breath Which thronging through her lips so vanisheth As smoke from tna that in air consumes Or that which from discharged cannon fumes In vain quoth she I live and seek in vain Some happy mean to end a hapless life I feared by Tarquins falchion to be slain Yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife But when I feared I was a loyal wife So am I nowO no that cannot be Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me O that is gone for which I sought to live And therefore now I need not fear to die To clear this spot by death at least I give A badge of fame to slanders livery A dying life to living infamy Poor helpless help the treasure stoln away To burn the guiltless casket where it lay Well well dear Collatine thou shalt not know The stained taste of violated troth I will not wrong thy true affection so To flatter thee with an infringed oath This bastard graff shall never come to growth He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute That thou art doting father of his fruit Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thoughtNor laugh with his companions at thy state But thou shalt know thy intrest was not bought Basely with gold but stoln from forth thy gate For me I am the mistress of my fate And with my trespass never will dispense Till life to death acquit my forced offence I will not poison thee with my attaint Nor fold my fault in cleanlycoined excuses My sable ground of sin I will not paint To hide the truth of this false nights abuses My tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices As from a mountainspring that feeds a dale Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale By this lamenting Philomel had ended The welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow And solemn night with slow sad gait descended To ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see And therefore still in night would cloistered be Revealing day through every cranny spies And seems to point her out where she sits weeping To whom she sobbing speaks O eye of eyes Why pryst thou through my window Leave thy peeping Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light For day hath naught to do whats done by night Thus cavils she with everything she sees True grief is fond and testy as a child Who wayward once his mood with naught agrees Old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild Continuance tames the one the other wild Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still With too much labour drowns for want of skill So she deepdrenched in a sea of care Holds disputation with each thing she views And to herself all sorrow doth compare No object but her passions strength renews And as one shifts another straight ensues Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words Sometime tis mad and too much talk affords The little birds that tune their mornings joy Make her moans mad with their sweet melody For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy Sad souls are slain in merry company Grief best is pleased with griefs society True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed When with like semblance it is sympathized Tis double death to drown in ken of shore He ten times pines that pines beholding food To see the salve doth make the wound ache more Great grief grieves most at that would do it good Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood Who being stopped the bounding banks oerflows Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows You mocking birds quoth she your tunes entomb Within your hollowswelling feathered breasts And in my hearing be you mute and dumb My restless discord loves no stops nor rests A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears Come Philomel that singst of ravishment Make thy sad grove in my disheveled hair As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment So I at each sad strain will strain a tear And with deep groans the diapason bear For burdenwise Ill hum on Tarquin still While thou on Tereus descants better skill And whiles against a thorn thou bearst thy part To keep thy sharp woes waking wretched I To imitate thee well against my heart Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye Who if it wink shall thereon fall and die These means as frets upon an instrument Shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment And for poor bird thou singst not in the day As shaming any eye should thee behold Some dark deep desert seated from the way That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold Will we find out and there we will unfold To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds Since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze Wildly determining which way to fly Or one encompassed with a winding maze That cannot tread the way out readily So with herself is she in mutiny To live or die which of the twain were better When life is shamed and Death reproachs debtor To kill myself quoth she alack what were it But with my body my poor souls pollution They that lose half with greater patience bear it Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion That mother tries a merciless conclusion Who having two sweet babes when death takes one Will slay the other and be nurse to none My body or my soul which was the dearer When the one pure the other made divine Whose love of either to myself was nearer When both were kept for heaven and Collatine Ay me the bark pilled from the lofty pine His leaves will wither and his sap decay So must my soul her bark being pilled away Her house is sacked her quiet interrupted Her mansion battered by the enemy Her sacred temple spotted spoiled corrupted Grossly engirt with daring infamy Then let it not be called impiety If in this blemished fort I make some hole Through which I may convey this troubled soul Yet die I will not till my Collatine Have heard the cause of my untimely death That he may vow in that sad hour of mine Revenge on him that made me stop my breath My stained blood to Tarquin Ill bequeath Which by him tainted shall for him be spent And as his due writ in my testament My honour Ill bequeath unto the knife That wounds my body so dishonoured Tis honour to deprive dishonoured life The one will live the other being dead So of shames ashes shall my fame be bred For in my death I murder shameful scorn My shame so dead mine honour is new born Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost What legacy shall I bequeath to thee My resolution love shall be thy boast By whose example thou revenged mayst be How Tarquin must be used read it in me Myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so This brief abridgement of my will I make My soul and body to the skies and ground My resolution husband do thou take Mine honour be the knifes that makes my wound My shame be his that did my fame confound And all my fame that lives disbursed be To those that live and think no shame of me Thou Collatine shalt oversee this will How was I overseen that thou shalt see it My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill My lifes foul deed my lifes fair end shall free it Faint not faint heart but stoutly say So be it Yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee Thou dead both die and both shall victors be This plot of death when sadly she had laid And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes With untuned tongue she hoarsely called her maid Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies For fleetwinged duty with thoughts feathers flies Poor Lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow Her mistress she doth give demure goodmorrow With soft slow tongue true mark of modesty And sorts a sad look to her ladys sorrow For why her face wore sorrows livery But durst not ask of her audaciously Why her two suns were cloudeclipsed so Nor why her fair cheeks overwashed with woe But as the earth doth weep the sun being set Each flower moistened like a melting eye Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet Her circled eyne enforced by sympathy Of those fair suns set in her mistress sky Who in a saltwaved ocean quench their light Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night A pretty while these pretty creatures stand Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling One justly weeps the other takes in hand No cause but company of her drops spilling Their gentle sex to weep are often willing Grieving themselves to guess at others smarts And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts For men have marble women waxen minds And therefore are they formed as marble will The weak oppressed th impression of strange kinds Is formed in them by force by fraud or skill Then call them not the authors of their ill No more than wax shall be accounted evil Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil Their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain Lays open all the little worms that creep In men as in a roughgrown grove remain Cavekeeping evils that obscurely sleep Through crystal walls each little mote will peep Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks Poor womens faces are their own faults books No man inveigh against the withered flower But chide rough winter that the flower hath killed Not that devoured but that which doth devour Is worthy blame O let it not be hild Poor womens faults that they are so fulfilled With mens abuses Those proud lords to blame Make weakmade women tenants to their shame The precedent whereof in Lucrece view Assailed by night with circumstances strong Of present death and shame that might ensue By that her death to do her husband wrong Such danger to resistance did belong The dying fear through all her body spread And who cannot abuse a body dead By this mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak To the poor counterfeit of her complaining My girl quoth she on what occasion break Those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining Know gentle wench it small avails my mood If tears could help mine own would do me good But tell me girl when wentand there she stayed Till after a deep groanTarquin from hence Madam ere I was up replied the maid The more to blame my sluggard negligence Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense Myself was stirring ere the break of day And ere I rose was Tarquin gone away But lady if your maid may be so bold She would request to know your heaviness O peace quoth Lucrece If it should be told The repetition cannot make it less For more it is than I can well express And that deep torture may be called a hell When more is felt than one hath power to tell Go get me hither paper ink and pen Yet save that labour for I have them here What should I sayOne of my husbands men Bid thou be ready by and by to bear A letter to my lord my love my dear Bid him with speed prepare to carry it The cause craves haste and it will soon be writ Her maid is gone and she prepares to write First hovering oer the paper with her quill Conceit and grief an eager combat fight What wit sets down is blotted straight with will This is too curiousgood this blunt and ill Much like a press of people at a door Throng her inventions which shall go before At last she thus begins Thou worthy lord Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee Health to thy person Next vouchsafe t affordIf ever love thy Lucrece thou wilt see Some present speed to come and visit me So I commend me from our house in grief My woes are tedious though my words are brief Here folds she up the tenor of her woe Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly By this short schedule Collatine may know Her grief but not her griefs true quality She dares not thereof make discovery Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse Besides the life and feeling of her passion She hoards to spend when he is by to hear her When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion Of her disgrace the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the world might bear her To shun this blot she would not blot the letter With words till action might become them better To see sad sights moves more than hear them told For then the eye interprets to the ear The heavy motion that it doth behold When every part a part of woe doth bear Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords And sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words Her letter now is sealed and on it writ At Ardea to my lord with more than haste The post attends and she delivers it Charging the sourfaced groom to hie as fast As lagging fowls before the northern blast Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems Extremely still urgeth such extremes The homely villain curtsies to her low And blushing on her with a steadfast eye Receives the scroll without or yea or no And forth with bashful innocence doth hie But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie Imagine every eye beholds their blame For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame When silly groom God wot it was defect Of spirit life and bold audacity Such harmless creatures have a true respect To talk in deeds while others saucily Promise more speed but do it leisurely Even so this pattern of the wornout age Pawned honest looks but laid no words to gage His kindled duty kindled her mistrust That two red fires in both their faces blazed She thought he blushed as knowing Tarquins lust And blushing with him wistly on him gazed Her earnest eye did make him more amazed The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish The more she thought he spied in her some blemish But long she thinks till he return again And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone The weary time she cannot entertain For now tis stale to sigh to weep to groan So woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan That she her plaints a little while doth stay Pausing for means to mourn some newer way At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of skilful painting made for Priams Troy Before the which is drawn the power of Greece For Helens rape the city to destroy Threatning cloudkissing Ilion with annoy Which the conceited painter drew so proud As heaven it seemed to kiss the turrets bowed A thousand lamentable objects there In scorn of Nature Art gave lifeless life Many a dry drop seemed a weeping tear Shed for the slaughtered husband by the wife The red blood reeked to show the painters strife The dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights There might you see the labouring pioneer Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust And from the towers of Troy there would appear The very eyes of men through loopholes thrust Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust Such sweet observance in this work was had That one might see those faroff eyes look sad In great commanders grace and majesty You might behold triumphing in their faces In youth quick bearing and dexterity And here and there the painter interlaces Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces Which heartless peasants did so well resemble That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble In Ajax and Ulysses O what art Of physiognomy might one behold The face of either ciphered eithers heart Their face their manners most expressly told In Ajax eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent Showed deep regard and smiling government There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand As twere encouraging the Greeks to fight Making such sober action with his hand That it beguiled attention charmed the sight In speech it seemed his beard all silver white Wagged up and down and from his lips did fly Thin winding breath which purled up to the sky About him were a press of gaping faces Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice All jointly listning but with several graces As if some mermaid did their ears entice Some high some low the painter was so nice The scalps of many almost hid behind To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind Here one mans hand leaned on anothers head His nose being shadowed by his neighbours ear Here one being thronged bears back all bolln and red Another smothered seems to pelt and swear And in their rage such signs of rage they bear As but for loss of Nestors golden words It seemed they would debate with angry swords For much imaginary work was there Conceit deceitful so compact so kind That for Achilles image stood his spear Griped in an armed hand himself behind Was left unseen save to the eye of mind A hand a foot a face a leg a head Stood for the whole to be imagined And from the walls of strongbesieged Troy When their brave hope bold Hector marched to field Stood many Trojan mothers sharing joy To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield And to their hope they such odd action yield That through their light joy seemed to appear Like bright things stained a kind of heavy fear And from the strand of Dardan where they fought To Simois reedy banks the red blood ran Whose waves to imitate the battle sought With swelling ridges and their ranks began To break upon the galled shore and then Retire again till meeting greater ranks They join and shoot their foam at Simois banks To this wellpainted piece is Lucrece come To find a face where all distress is stelled Many she sees where cares have carved some But none where all distress and dolour dwelled Till she despairing Hecuba beheld Staring on Priams wounds with her old eyes Which bleeding under Pyrrhus proud foot lies In her the painter had anatomized Times ruin beautys wrack and grim cares reign Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised Of what she was no semblance did remain Her blue blood changed to black in every vein Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed Showed life imprisoned in a body dead On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes And shapes her sorrow to the beldams woes Who nothing wants to answer her but cries And bitter words to ban her cruel foes The painter was no god to lend her those And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong To give her so much grief and not a tongue Poor instrument quoth she without a sound Ill tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue And drop sweet balm in Priams painted wound And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies Show me the strumpet that began this stir That with my nails her beauty I may tear Thy heat of lust fond Paris did incur This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here And here in Troy for trespass of thine eye The sire the son the dame and daughter die Why should the private pleasure of some one Become the public plague of many moe Let sin alone committed light alone Upon his head that hath transgressed so Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe For ones offence why should so many fall To plague a private sin in general Lo here weeps Hecuba here Priam dies Here manly Hector faints here Troilus swounds Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds And one mans lust these many lives confounds Had doting Priam checked his sons desire Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire Here feelingly she weeps Troys painted woes For sorrow like a heavyhanging bell Once set on ringing with his own weight goes Then little strength rings out the doleful knell So Lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow She lends them words and she their looks doth borrow She throws her eyes about the painting round And who she finds forlorn she doth lament At last she sees a wretched image bound That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent His face though full of cares yet showed content Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes So mild that patience seemed to scorn his woes In him the painter laboured with his skill To hide deceit and give the harmless show An humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe Cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so That blushing red no guilty instance gave Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have But like a constant and confirmed devil He entertained a show so seeming just And therein so ensconced his secret evil That jealousy itself could not mistrust Falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such blackfaced storms Or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms The wellskilled workman this mild image drew For perjured Sinon whose enchanting story The credulous Old Priam after slew Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory Of richbuilt Ilion that the skies were sorry And little stars shot from their fixed places When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces This picture she advisedly perused And chid the painter for his wondrous skill Saying some shape in Sinons was abused So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill And still on him she gazed and gazing still Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied That she concludes the picture was belied It cannot be quoth she that so much guile She would have said can lurk in such a look But Tarquins shape came in her mind the while And from her tongue can lurk from cannot took It cannot be she in that sense forsook And turned it thus It cannot be I find But such a face should bear a wicked mind For even as subtle Sinon here is painted So sobersad so weary and so mild As if with grief or travail he had fainted To me came Tarquin armed too beguiled With outward honesty but yet defiledWith inward vice As Priam him did cherish So did I Tarquin so my Troy did perish Look look how listening Priam wets his eyes To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds Priam why art thou old and yet not wise For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds His eye drops fire no water thence proceeds Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city Such devils steal effects from lightless hell For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold And in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell These contraries such unity do hold Only to flatter fools and make them bold So Priams trust false Sinons tears doth flatter That he finds means to burn his Troy with water Here all enraged such passion her assails That patience is quite beaten from her breast She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails Comparing him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself detest At last she smilingly with this gives oer Fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow And time doth weary time with her complaining She looks for night and then she longs for morrow And both she thinks too long with her remaining Short time seems long in sorrows sharp sustaining Though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps And they that watch see time how slow it creeps Which all this time hath overslipped her thought That she with painted images hath spent Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep surmise of others detriment Losing her woes in shows of discontent It easeth some though none it ever cured To think their dolour others have endured But now the mindful messenger come back Brings home his lord and other company Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black And round about her teardistained eye Blue circles streamed like rainbows in the sky These watergalls in her dim element Foretell new storms to those already spent Which when her sadbeholding husband saw Amazedly in her sad face he stares Her eyes though sod in tears looked red and raw Her lively colour killed with deadly cares He hath no power to ask her how she fares Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance Met far from home wondring each others chance At last he takes her by the bloodless hand And thus begins What uncouth ill event Hath thee befalln that thou dost trembling stand Sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent Why art thou thus attired in discontent Unmask dear dear this moody heaviness And tell thy grief that we may give redress Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire Ere once she can discharge one word of woe At length addressed to answer his desire She modestly prepares to let them know Her honour is taen prisoner by the foe While Collatine and his consorted lords With sad attention long to hear her words And now this pale swan in her watry nest Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending Few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best Where no excuse can give the fault amending In me more woes than words are now depending And my laments would be drawn out too long To tell them all with one poor tired tongue Then be this all the task it hath to say Dear husband in the interest of thy bed A stranger came and on that pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head And what wrong else may be imagined By foul enforcement might be done to me From that alas thy Lucrece is not free For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight With shining falchion in my chamber came A creeping creature with a flaming light And softly cried Awake thou Roman dame And entertain my love else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will inflict If thou my loves desire do contradict For some hardfavoured groom of thine quoth he Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will Ill murder straight and then Ill slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did fulfil The loathsome act of lust and so did kill The lechers in their deed This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy With this I did begin to start and cry And then against my heart he sets his sword Swearing unless I took all patiently I should not live to speak another word So should my shame still rest upon record And never be forgot in mighty Rome The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom Mine enemy was strong my poor self weak And far the weaker with so strong a fear My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak No rightful plea might plead for justice there His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes And when the judge is robbed the prisoner dies O teach me how to make mine own excuse Or at the least this refuge let me find Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse Immaculate and spotless is my mind That was not forced that never was inclined To accessary yieldings but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure Lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss With head declined and voice dammed up with woe With sad set eyes and wretched arms across From lips newwaxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so But wretched as he is he strives in vain What he breathes out his breath drinks up again As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast In rage sent out recalled in rage being past Even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw To push grief on and back the same grief draw Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh Dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth Another power no flood by raining slaketh My woe too sensible thy passion maketh More feelingpainful Let it then suffice To drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes And for my sake when I might charm thee so For she that was thy Lucrece now attend me Be suddenly revenged on my foe Thine mine his own Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late yet let the traitor die For sparing justice feeds iniquity But ere I name him you fair lords quoth she Speaking to those that came with Collatine Shall plight your honourable faiths to me With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine For tis a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms Knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms At this request with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid As bound in knighthood to her imposition Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed But she that yet her sad task hath not said The protestation stops O speak quoth she How may this forced stain be wiped from me What is the quality of my offence Being constrained with dreadful circumstance May my pure mind with the foul"

bonum quo antiquius eo melius If you born in these latter times When wits more ripe accept my rhymes And that to hear an old man sing May to your wishes pleasure bring I life would wish and that I might Waste it for you like taperlight This Antioch then Antiochus the Great Built up this city for his chiefest seat The fairest in all Syria I tell you what mine authors say This king unto him took a fere Who died and left a female heir So buxom blithe and full of face As heaven had lent her all his grace With whom the father liking took And her to incest did provoke Bad child worse father to entice his own To evil should be done by none But custom what they did begin Was with long use accountd no sin The beauty of this sinful dame Made many princes thither frame To seek her as a bedfellow In marriage pleasures playfellow Which to prevent he made a law To keep her still and men in awe That whoso askd her for his wife His riddle told not lost his life So for her many a wight did die As

but dangerous to be touchd For deathlike dragons here affright thee hard Her face like heaven enticeth thee to view Her countless glory which desert must gain And which without desert because thine eye Presumes to reach all the whole heap must die Yon sometimes famous princes like thyself Drawn by report adventurous by desire Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale That without covering save yon field of stars Here they stand Martyrs slain in Cupids wars And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist For going on deaths net whom none resist PERICLES Antiochus I thank thee who hath taught My frail mortality to know itself And by those fearful objects to prepare This body like to them to what I must For death rememberd should be like a mirror Who tells us lifes but breath to trust it error Ill make my will then and as sick men do Who know the world see heaven but feeling woe Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did So I bequeath a happy peace to you And all good men as every prince should do My riches to the earth from whence they came To the daughter of Antiochus But my unspotted fire of love to you Thus ready for the way of life or death I wait the sharpest blow

For hes no man on whom perfections wait That knowing sin within will touch the gate You are a fair viol and your sense the strings Who fingerd to make man his lawful music Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken But being playd upon before your time Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime Good sooth I care not for you ANTIOCHUS Prince Pericles touch not upon thy life For thats an article

hast thou stowd my daughter Damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her For Ill refer me to all things of sense If she in chains of magic were not bound Whether a maid so tender fair and happy So opposite to marriage that she shunnd The wealthy curled darlings of our nation Would ever have to incur a general mock Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thouto fear not to delight Judge me the world if tis not gross in sense That thou hast practisd on her with foul charms Abusd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion Ill havet disputed on Tis

credit FIRST SENATOR Indeed they are disproportiond My letters say a hundred and seven galleys DUKE And mine a hundred and forty SECOND SENATOR And mine two hundred But though they jump not on a just account As in these cases where the aim reports Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus DUKE Nay it is possible enough to judgement I do not so secure me in the error But the main article I do approve In fearful sense SAILOR Within What ho what ho what ho OFFICER A messenger from the galleys Enter Sailor DUKE Nowwhats the business SAILOR The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo DUKE How say you by this change FIRST SENATOR This cannot be By no assay of reason Tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dressd in If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskilful To leave that latest which concerns him first Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless DUKE Nay in all confidence hes not for Rhodes OFFICER Here is more news Enter a Messenger MESSENGER The Ottomites reverend and gracious Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes Have there injointed them with an after fleet FIRST SENATOR Ay so I thought How many as you guess MESSENGER Of thirty sail and now they do restem Their backward course bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano Your trusty and most valiant servitor With his free duty recommends you thus And prays you to believe him DUKE Tis certain then for Cyprus Marcus Luccicos is not he in town FIRST SENATOR Hes now in Florence DUKE Write from us to him postposthaste dispatch FIRST SENATOR Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor Enter Brabantio Othello Iago Roderigo and Officers DUKE Valiant Othello we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman To Brabantio I did not see you welcome gentle signior We lackd your counsel and your help tonight BRABANTIO So did I yours Good your grace pardon me Neither my place nor aught I heard of business Hath raisd me from my bed nor doth the general care Take hold on me for my particular grief Is of so floodgate and oerbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrowsAnd it is still itself DUKE Why whats the matter BRABANTIO My daughter O my daughter DUKE and SENATORS Dead BRABANTIO Ay to me She is abused stoln from me and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks For nature so preposterously to err Being not deficient blind or lame of sense Sans witchcraft could not DUKE Whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguild your daughter of herself And you of her the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense yea though our proper son Stood in your action BRABANTIO Humbly I thank your grace Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought ALL We are very sorry for t DUKE To Othello What in your own part can you say to this BRABANTIO Nothing but this is so OTHELLO Most potent grave and reverend signiors My very noble and approvd good masters That I have taen away this old mans daughter It is most true true I have married her The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech And little blessd with the soft phrase of peace For since these arms of mine had seven years pith Till now some nine moons wasted they have usd Their dearest action in the tented field And little of this great world can I speak More than pertains to feats of broil and battle And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience I will a round unvarnishd tale deliver Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms What conjuration and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter BRABANTIO A maiden never bold Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushd at herself and she in spite of nature Of years of country credit everything To fall in love with what she feard to look on It is judgement maimd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful oer the blood Or with some dram conjurd to this effect He wrought upon her DUKE To vouch this is no proof Without more wider and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him FIRST SENATOR But Othello speak Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maids affections Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth OTHELLO I do beseech you Send for the lady to the Sagittary And let her speak of me before her father If you do find me foul in her report The trust the office I do hold of you Not only take away but let your sentence Even fall upon my life DUKE Fetch Desdemona hither OTHELLO Ancient conduct them you best know the place Exeunt Iago and Attendants And till she come as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears Ill present How I did thrive in this fair ladys love And she in mine DUKE Say it Othello OTHELLO Her father lovd me oft invited me Still questiond me the story of my life From year to yearthe battles sieges fortunes That I have passd I ran it through even from my boyish days To the very moment that he bade me tell it Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances Of moving accidents by flood and field Of hairbreadth scapes i th imminent deadly breach Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery of my redemption thence And portance in my travelers history Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speaksuch was the process And of the Cannibals that each other eat The Anthropophagi and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline But still the house affairs would draw her thence Which ever as she could with haste dispatch Shed come again and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse which I observing Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively I did consent And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth sufferd My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange Twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful She wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd That heaven had made her such a man she thankd me And bade me if I had a friend that lovd her I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake She lovd me for the dangers I had passd And I lovd her that she did pity them This only is the witchcraft I have usd Here comes the lady Let her witness it Enter Desdemona Iago and Attendants DUKE I think this tale would win my daughter too Good Brabantio Take up this mangled matter at the best Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands BRABANTIO I pray you hear her speak If she confess that she was half the wooer Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the manCome hither gentle mistress Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience DESDEMONA My noble father I do perceive here a divided duty To you I am bound for life and education My life and education both do learn me How to respect you You are the lord of duty I am hitherto your daughter but heres my husband And so much duty as my mother showd To you preferring you before her father So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord BRABANTIO God be with you I have done Please it your grace on to the state affairs I had rather to adopt a child than get it Come hither Moor I here do give thee that with all my heart Which but thou hast already with all my heart I would keep from theeFor your sake jewel I am glad at soul I have no other child For thy escape would teach me tyranny To hang clogs on themI have done my lord DUKE Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which as a grise or step may help these lovers Into your favour When remedies are past the griefs are ended By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on What cannot be preserved when fortune takes Patience her injury a mockery makes The robbd that smiles steals something from the thief He robs himself that spends a bootless grief BRABANTIO So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile We lose it not so long as we can smile He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow These sentences to sugar or to gall Being strong on both sides are equivocal But words are words I never yet did hear That the bruisd heart was pierced through the ear I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state DUKE The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you And though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition OTHELLO The tyrant custom most grave senators Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thricedriven bed of down I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness and do undertake This present wars against the Ottomites Most humbly therefore bending to your state I crave fit disposition for my wife Due reference of place and exhibition With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding DUKE If you please Bet at her fathers BRABANTIO Ill not have it so OTHELLO Nor I DESDEMONA Nor I I would not there reside To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye Most gracious duke To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice T assist my simpleness DUKE What would you Desdemona DESDEMONA That I did love the Moor to live with

conclusionDo not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husbandHow say you Cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor CASSIO He speaks home madam You may relish him more in the soldier than

courtship You say true tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good well kissed an excellent courtesy Tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clysterpipes for your sake Trumpets within The Moor I know his trumpet CASSIO Tis truly so DESDEMONA Lets meet him and receive him CASSIO Lo where he comes Enter Othello and Attendants OTHELLO O my fair warrior DESDEMONA My dear Othello OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me O my souls joy If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have wakend death And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympushigh and duck again as low As hells from heaven If it were now to die Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate DESDEMONA The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow OTHELLO Amen to that sweet powers I cannot speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords be They kiss That eer our hearts shall make IAGO Aside O you are well tund now But Ill set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I am OTHELLO Come let us to the castle News friends our wars are done the Turks are drownd How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey you shall be well desird in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comfortsI prithee good Iago Go to the bay and disembark my coffers Bring thou the master to the citadel He is a good one and his worthiness Does challenge much respectCome Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprus Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants IAGO Do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come hither If thou best valiantas they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him RODERIGO With him Why tis not possible IAGO Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed And what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none A slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after A pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already RODERIGO I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition IAGO Blest figs end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that RODERIGO Yes that I did But that was but courtesy IAGO Lechery by this hand An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embracd together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight For the command Ill layt upon you Cassio knows you not Ill not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister RODERIGO Well IAGO Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell RODERIGO Adieu Exit IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evend with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash For his quick hunting stand the putting on Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness Tis here but yet confusd Knaverys plain face is never seen till usd Exit SCENE II A street Enter Othellos Herald with a proclamation HERALD It is Othellos pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport

CASSIO I pray you pardon me I cannot speak OTHELLO Worthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure

but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approvd in this offence Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth

following him with determind sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamour as it so fell out The town might fall in fright he swift of foot Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I neer might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience

what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation IAGO As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you CASSIO I know not IAGO Ist possible CASSIO I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains That we should

so and tis well Enter a Messenger with letters What letters hast thou there I can but thank you MESSENGER These letters come from your father HOTSPUR Letters from him Why comes he not himself

physicians WORCESTER I would the state of time had first been whole Ere he by sickness had been visited His health was never better worth than now HOTSPUR Sick now Droop now This sickness doth infect The very lifeblood of our enterprise Tis catching hither even to our camp He writes me here that inward sickness And that his friends by deputation could not So soon be drawn nor did he think it meet To lay so dangerous and dear a trust On any soul removed but on his own Yet doth he give us bold advertisement That with our small conjunction we should on To see how fortune is disposed to us For as he writes there is no quailing now Because the King is certainly possessd Of all our purposes What say you to it WORCESTER Your fathers sickness is a maim to us HOTSPUR A perilous gash a very limb loppd off And yet in faith it is not His present want Seems more than we shall find it Were it good To set the exact wealth of all our states All at one cast To set so rich a main On the nice hazard

remains A sweet reversion We may boldly spend Upon the hope of what is to come in A comfort of retirement lives in this HOTSPUR A rendezvous a home to fly unto If that the devil and mischance look big Upon the maidenhead of our affairs WORCESTER But yet I would your father had been here The quality and hair of our attempt Brooks no division It will be thought By some that know not why he is away That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence And think how such an apprehension May turn the tide of fearful faction And breed a kind of question in our cause For well you know we of the offring side Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement And stop all sightholes every loop from whence The eye of reason may pry in upon us This absence of your fathers draws a curtain That shows the ignorant a kind of fear Before not dreamt of HOTSPUR You strain too far I rather of his absence make this use It lends a lustre and more great opinion A larger dare to our great enterprise Than if the Earl were here for men must think If we without his help can make a head To push against the kingdom with his help We shall oerturn it topsyturvy down Yet all goes well yet all

from the ground like featherd Mercury And vaulted with such ease into his seat As if an angel droppd down from the clouds To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus And witch the world with noble horsemanship HOTSPUR No more no more Worse than the sun in March This praise doth nourish agues Let them come They come like sacrifices in their trim And to the fireeyed maid of smoky war All hot and bleeding will we offer them The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit Up to the ears in blood I am on fire To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh And yet not ours Come let me taste my horse Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse Meet and neer part till one drop down a corse O that Glendower were come VERNON There is more news I learnd in Worcester as I rode along He cannot draw his power this fourteen days DOUGLAS Thats the worst tidings that I hear of yet WORCESTER Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound HOTSPUR What may the

they have bought out their services and now my whole charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants gentlemen of companiesslaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth where the gluttons dogs licked his sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust servingmen younger sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers tradefallen the cankers of a calm world and a long peace ten times more dishonourableragged than an old fazed ancient and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swinekeeping from eating draff and husks A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies No eye hath seen such scarecrows Ill not march through Coventry with them thats flat Nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed I had the most of them out of prison Theres not a shirt and a half in all my company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a heralds coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth stolen from

when he was not sixandtwenty strong Sick in the worlds regard wretched and low A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home My father gave him welcome to the shore And when he heard him swear and vow to God He came but to be Duke of Lancaster To sue his livery and beg his peace With tears of innocence and terms of zeal My father in kind heart and pity moved Swore him assistance and performed it too Now when the lords and barons of the realm Perceived Northumberland did lean to him The more and less came in with cap and knee Met him in boroughs cities villages Attended him on bridges stood in lanes Laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths Give him their heirs as pages followd him Even at the heels in golden multitudes He presently as greatness knows itself Steps me a little higher than his vow Made to my father while his blood was poor Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh And now forsooth takes on him to reform Some certain edicts and some strait decrees That lie too heavy on the

a day Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men Must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury As I am truly given to understand The King with mighty and quickraised power Meets with Lord Harry And I fear Sir Michael What with the sickness of Northumberland Whose power was in the first proportion And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence Who with them was a rated sinew too And comes not in oerruld by prophecies I fear the power of Percy is too weak To wage an instant trial with the King SIR MICHAEL Why my good lord you need not fear There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer ARCHBISHOP No Mortimer is not there SIR MICHAEL But there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head Of gallant warriors noble gentlemen ARCHBISHOP And so there is But yet the King hath drawn The special head of all the land together The Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt And many more corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms SIR MICHAEL Doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed ARCHBISHOP I hope no less yet needful tis to fear And to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed For if Lord Percy thrive not ere the King

with the losers let it sympathize For nothing can seem foul to those that win The trumpet sounds Enter Worcester and Vernon How now my Lord of Worcester Tis not well That you and I should meet upon such terms As now we meet You have deceived our trust And made us doff our easy robes of peace To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel This is not well my lord this is not well What say you to it Will you again unknit This churlish knot of allabhorred war And move in that obedient orb again Where you did give a fair and natural light And be no more an exhaled meteor A prodigy of fear and a portent Of broached mischief to the unborn times WORCESTER Hear me my liege For mine own part I could be well content To entertain the lag end of my life With quiet hours For I do protest I have not sought the day of this dislike KING You have not sought it How comes it then FALSTAFF Rebellion lay in his way and he found it PRINCE Peace chewet peace WORCESTER It pleased your Majesty to turn your looks Of favour from myself and all our house And yet I must remember you my lord We were the first and dearest of your friends For you my staff of office did I break In Richards time and posted day and night To meet you on the way and kiss your hand When yet you were in place and in account Nothing so strong and fortunate as I It was myself my brother and his son That brought you home and boldly did outdare The dangers of the time You swore to us And you did swear that oath at Doncaster That you did nothing purpose gainst the state Nor claim no further than your newfalln right The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster To this we swore our aid But in short space It raind down fortune showring on your head And such a flood of greatness fell on you What with our help what with the absent King What with the injuries of a wanton time The seeming sufferances that you had borne And the contrarious winds that held the King So long in his unlucky Irish wars That all in England did repute him dead And from this swarm of fair advantages You took occasion to be quickly wood To gripe the general sway into your hand Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster And being fed by us you used us so As that ungentle gull the cuckoos bird Useth the sparrowdid oppress our nest Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk That even our love durst not come near your sight For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing We were enforced for safety sake to fly Out of your sight and raise this present head Whereby we stand opposed by such means As you yourself have forged against yourself By unkind usage dangerous countenance And violation of all faith and troth Sworn to us in your younger enterprise KING These things indeed you have articulate Proclaimd at market crosses read in churches To face the garment of rebellion With some fine colour that may please the eye Of fickle changelings and poor discontents Which gape and rub the elbow at the news Of hurlyburly innovation And never yet did insurrection want Such watercolours to impaint his cause Nor moody beggars starving for a time Of pellmell havoc and confusionPRINCE In both your armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter If once they join in trial Tell your nephew The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy By my hopes This present enterprise set off his head I do not think a braver gentleman More activevaliant or more valiantyoung More daring or more bold is now alive To grace this latter age with noble deeds For my part I may speak it to my shame I have a truant been to chivalry And so I hear he doth account me too Yet this before my fathers Majesty I am content that he shall take the odds Of his great name and estimation And will to save the blood on either side Try fortune with him in a single fight KING And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee Albeit considerations infinite Do make against itNo good Worcester no We love our people well even those we love That are misled upon your cousins part And will they take the offer of our grace Both he and they and you yea every man Shall be my friend again and Ill be his So tell your cousin and then bring me word What he will do But if he will not yield Rebuke and dread correction wait on us And they shall do their office So be gone We will not now be troubled with reply We offer fair take it advisedly Exit Worcester with Vernon PRINCE It will not be accepted on my life The Douglas and the Hotspur both together Are confident against the world in arms KING Hence therefore every leader to his charge For on their answer will we set on them And God befriend us as our cause is just Exeunt the King Blunt and Prince John FALSTAFF Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so tis a point of friendship PRINCE Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship Say thy prayers and farewell FALSTAFF I would twere bedtime Hal and all well PRINCE Why thou owest God a death Exit FALSTAFF Tis not due yet I would be loth to pay Him before His day What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me Well tis no matter honour pricks me on Yea but how if honour prick me off when I come on How then Can honor set to a leg No Or an arm No Or take away the grief of a wound No Honour hath no skill in surgery then No What is honour A word What is in that word honour What is that honour Air A

whence you came PROTEUS Your friends are well and have them much commended VALENTINE And how do yours PROTEUS I left them all in health VALENTINE How does your lady And how thrives your love PROTEUS My tales of love were wont to weary you I know you joy not in a lovediscourse VALENTINE Ay Proteus but that life is altered now I have done penance for contemning Love Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me With bitter fasts with penitential groans With nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs For in revenge of my contempt of love Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes And made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow O gentle Proteus Loves a mighty lord And hath so humbled me as I confess There is no woe to his correction Nor to his service no such joy on earth Now no discourse except it be of love Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep Upon the very naked name of love PROTEUS Enough I read your fortune in your eye Was this the idol that you worship so VALENTINE Even she and is she not a heavenly saint PROTEUS No but she is an earthly paragon VALENTINE Call her divine PROTEUS I will not flatter her VALENTINE O flatter me for love delights in praises

too She shall be dignified with this high honour To bear my ladys train lest the base earth Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss And of so great a favour growing proud Disdain to root the summerswelling flower And make rough winter everlastingly PROTEUS Why Valentine what braggartism is this VALENTINE Pardon me Proteus all I can is nothing To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing She is alone PROTEUS Then let her alone VALENTINE Not for the world Why man she is mine own And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl The water nectar and the rocks pure gold Forgive me that I do not dream on thee Because thou seest me dote upon my love My foolish rival that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge Is gone with her along and I must after For love thou knowst is full of jealousy PROTEUS But she loves you VALENTINE Ay and we are betrothed nay more our marriage hour With all the cunning manner of our flight Determined of how I must climb her window The ladder made of cords and all the means Plotted and greed on for my happiness Good Proteus go with me to my chamber In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel PROTEUS Go on before I shall enquire you forth I must unto the road to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use And then Ill presently attend you VALENTINE Will you make haste PROTEUS I will Exit Valentine Even as one heat another heat expels Or as one nail by strength drives out another So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten Is it mine eye or Valentines praise Her true perfection or my false transgression That makes me reasonless to reason thus She is fair and so is Julia that I love That I did love for now my love is thawed Which like a waxen image gainst a fire Bears no impression of the thing it was Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold And that I love him not as I was wont O but I love his lady too too much And thats the reason I love him so little How shall I dote on her with more advice That thus without advice begin to love her Tis but her picture I have yet beheld And that hath dazzled my reasons light But when I look on her perfections There is no reason but I shall be blind If I can check my erring love I will If not to compass her Ill use my skill Exit SCENE V The same A street Enter Speed and Lance with his dog

forsworn And een that power which gave me first my oath Provokes me to this threefold perjury Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear O sweetsuggesting Love if thou hast sinned Teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it At first I did adore a twinkling star But now I worship a celestial sun Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken And he wants wit that wants resolved will To learn his wit t exchange the bad for better Fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred With twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths I cannot leave to love and yet I do But there I leave to love where I should love Julia I lose and Valentine I lose If I keep them I needs must lose myself If I lose them thus find I by their loss For Valentine myself for Julia Silvia I to myself am dearer than a friend For love is still most precious in itself And Silviawitness heaven that made her fair Shows Julia but a swarthy EthiopeI will forget that Julia is alive Remembering that my love to her is dead And Valentine Ill hold an enemy Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend I cannot now prove constant to myself Without some treachery used to Valentine This night he meaneth with a corded ladder To climb celestial Silvias chamber window Myself in counsel his competitor Now presently Ill give her father notice Of their disguising and pretended flight Who all enraged will banish Valentine For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter But Valentine being gone Ill quickly cross By some sly trick blunt Thurios dull proceeding Love lend me wings to make my purpose swift As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift Exit SCENE VII Verona A room in Julias house Enter Julia and Lucetta JULIA Counsel Lucetta gentle girl assist me And evn in kind love I do conjure thee Who art the

wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath Meeting two such wealsmen as you areI cannot call you Lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I cannot say your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables And though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces If you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough too BRUTUS Come sir come we know you well enough MENENIUS You know neither me yourselves nor anything You are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and a faucetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves You are a pair of strange ones BRUTUS Come come You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss packsaddle Yet you must be saying Martius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen Good een to your Worships More of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you He begins to exit Brutus

expedition twentyfive wounds upon him MENENIUS Now its twentyseven Every gash was an enemys grave A shout and flourish Hark the trumpets VOLUMNIA These are the ushers of Martius before him he carries

inherited my very wishes And the buildings of my fancy Only Theres one thing wanting which I doubt not but Our Rome will cast upon thee CORIOLANUS Know good mother I had rather be their servant in my way Than sway with them in theirs COMINIUS On to the Capitol Flourish of cornets Exeunt in state as before Brutus and Sicinius come forward BRUTUS All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights Are spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse Into a rapture lets her baby cry While she chats him The kitchen malkin pins Her richest lockram bout her reechy neck Clambring the walls to eye him Stalls bulks windows Are smothered up leads filled and ridges horsed With variable complexions all agreeing In earnestness to see him Seldshown flamens Do press among the popular throngs and puff To win a vulgar station Our veiled dames Commit the war of white and damask in Their nicelygauded cheeks to th wanton spoil Of Phoebus burning kisses Such a pother As if that whatsoever god who leads him Were slyly crept into his human powers And gave him graceful posture SICINIUS On the sudden I warrant him consul BRUTUS Then our office may During his power go sleep SICINIUS He cannot temprately transport his honours From where he should begin and end but will Lose those he hath won BRUTUS In that theres comfort SICINIUS Doubt not the commoners for whom we stand But they upon their ancient malice will forget With the least cause these his new honourswhich That he will give them make as little question As he is proud to dot BRUTUS I heard him swear Were he to stand for consul never would he Appear i th marketplace nor on him put The napless vesture of humility Nor showing as the manner is his wounds To th people beg their stinking breaths SICINIUS Tis right BRUTUS It was his word O he would miss it ratherThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him And the desire of the nobles SICINIUS I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution BRUTUS Tis most like he will SICINIUS It shall be to him then as our good wills A sure destruction BRUTUS So it must fall out To him or our authorities for an end We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them that tos power he would Have made them mules silenced their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms holding them In human action and capacity Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in their war who have their provand Only for bearing burdens and sore blows For sinking under them SICINIUS This as you say suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want If it be put upont and thats as easy As to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever Enter a Messenger BRUTUS Whats the matter MESSENGER You are sent for to the Capitol Tis thought That Martius shall be consul I have seen The dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs Upon him as he passed the nobles bended As to Joves statue and the Commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like BRUTUS Lets to the Capitol And carry with us ears and eyes for th time But hearts for the event SICINIUS Have with you Exeunt SCENE II Rome The Capitol Enter two Officers to lay cushions as it were in the Capitol FIRST OFFICER Come come They are almost here How many stand for consulships SECOND OFFICER Three they say but tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it FIRST OFFICER Thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury To report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it FIRST OFFICER No more of him hes a worthy man Make way They are coming A sennet Enter the Patricians and the Tribunes of the people Lictors before them Coriolanus Menenius Cominius the consul The Patricians sit Sicinius and Brutus take their places by themselves Coriolanus stands MENENIUS Having determined of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius it remains As the main point of this our aftermeeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our wellfound successes to report A little of that worthy work performed By Martius Caius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself Coriolanus sits FIRST SENATOR Speak good Cominius Leave nothing out for length and make us think Rather our states defective for requital Than we to stretch it out Masters o th people We do request your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here SICINIUS We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly BRUTUS Which the rather We shall be blest to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto prized them at MENENIUS Thats off thats off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speak BRUTUS Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it MENENIUS He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speak Coriolanus rises and offers to go away Nay keep your place FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear What you have nobly done CORIOLANUS Your Honours pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them BRUTUS Sir I hope My words disbenched you not CORIOLANUS No sir Yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You soothed not therefore hurt not but your people I love them as they weigh MENENIUS Pray now sit down CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered Exit MENENIUS Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one ons ears to hear itProceed Cominius COMINIUS I shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver if it be The man I speak of cannot in the world Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him He bestrid An oerpressed Roman and i th Consuls view Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met And struck him on his knee In that days feats When he might act the woman in the scene He proved best man i th field and for his meed Was browbound with the oak His pupil age Manentered thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurched all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioles let me say I cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport As weeds before A vessel under sail so men obeyed And fell below his stem His sword Deaths stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was timed with dying cries Alone he entered The mortal gate o th city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioles like a planet Now alls his When by and by the din of war gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Requickened what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking oer the lives of men as if Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting MENENIUS Worthy man FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him COMINIUS Our spoils he kicked at And looked upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it MENENIUS Hes right noble Let him be called for FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus OFFICER He doth appear Enter Coriolanus MENENIUS The Senate Coriolanus are well pleased To make thee consul CORIOLANUS I do owe them still My life and services MENENIUS It then remains That you do speak to the people CORIOLANUS I do beseech you Let me oerleap that custom for I cannot Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds sake to give their suffrage Please you That I may pass this doing SICINIUS Sir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony MENENIUS Put them not tot Pray you go fit you to the custom and Take to you as your predecessors have Your honour with your form CORIOLANUS It is a part That I shall blush in acting and might well Be taken from the people BRUTUS Mark you that CORIOLANUS To brag unto them thus I did and thus Show them th unaching scars which I should hide As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only MENENIUS Do not stand upont We recommend"

mightst my seat forbear And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee Thine by thy beauty being false to me 42 That thou hast her it is not all my grief And yet it may be said I loved her dearly That she hath thee is of my wailing chief A loss in love that touches me more nearly Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her And for my sake even so doth she abuse me Suffring my friend for my sake to approve her If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain And losing her my friend hath found that loss Both find each other and I lose both twain And both for my sake lay on me this cross But heres the joy my friend and I are one Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone 43 When most I wink then do mine eyes best see For all the day they view things unrespected But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee And darkly bright are bright in dark directed Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadows form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so How would I say mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay All days are nights to see till I see thee And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 44 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought Injurious distance should not stop my way For then despite of space I would be brought From limits far remote where thou dost stay No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be But ah thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone But that so much of earth and water wrought I must attend times leisure with my moan Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears badges of eithers woe 45 The other two slight air and purging fire Are both with thee wherever I abide The first my thought the other my desire These presentabsent with swift motion slide For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee My life being made of four with two alone Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy Until lifes composition be recured By those swift messengers returned from thee Who even but now come back again assured Of thy fair health recounting it to me This told I joy but then no longer glad I send them back again and straight grow sad 46 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar My heart mine eye the freedom of that right My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie A closet never pierced with crystal eyes But the defendant doth that plea deny And says in him thy fair appearance lies To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart And by their verdict is determined The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part And my hearts right thy inward love of heart 47 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took And each doth good turns now unto the other When that mine eye is famished for a look Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother With my loves picture then my eye doth feast And to the painted banquet bids my heart Another time mine eye is my hearts guest And in his thoughts of love doth share a part So either by thy picture or my love Thyself away art present still with me For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move And I am still with them and they with thee Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight 48 How careful was I when I took my way Each trifle under truest bars to thrust That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust But thou to whom my jewels trifles are Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief Thou best of dearest and mine only care Art left the prey of every vulgar thief Thee have I not locked up in any chest Save where thou art not though I feel thou art Within the gentle closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 49 Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my defects When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws Since why to love I can allege no cause 50 How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary travels end Doth teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend The beast that bears me tired with my woe Plods dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide Which heavily he answers with a groan More sharp to me than spurring to his side For that same groan doth put this in my mind My grief lies onward and my joy behind 51 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of perfectst love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went wilfulslow Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go 52 So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure The which he will not every hour survey For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like stones of worth they thinly placed are Or captain jewels in the carcanet So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hideTo make some special instant specialblest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope Being had to triumph being lacked to hope 53 What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe Adonis and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you On Helens cheek all art of beauty set And you in Grecian tires are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty doth appear And you in every blessed shape we know In all external grace you have some part But you like none none you for constant heart 54 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly When summers breath their masked buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made And so of you beauteous and lovely youth When that shall fade my verse distills your truth 55 Not marble nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time When wasteful war shall statues overturn And broils root out the work of masonry Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory Gainst death and alloblivious enmity Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom So till the judgement that yourself arise You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes 56 Sweet love renew thy force be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite Which but today by feeding is allayed Tomorrow sharpened in his former might So love be thou although today thou fill Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness Tomorrow see again and do not kill The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore where two contracted new Come daily to the banks that when they see Return of love more blest may be the view Or call it winter which being full of care Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare 57 Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend Nor services to do till you require Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be or your affairs suppose But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are how happy you make those So true a fool is love that in your will Though you do any thing he thinks no ill 58 That god forbid that made me first your slave I should in thought control your times of pleasure Or at your hand th account of hours to crave Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure O let me suffer being at your beck Th imprisoned absence of your liberty And patience tame to sufferance bide each check Without accusing you of injury Be where you list your charter is so strong That you yourself may privilage your time To what you will to you it doth belong Yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime I am to wait though waiting so be hell Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well 59 If there be nothing new but that which is Hath been before how are our brains beguiled Which labouring for invention bear amiss The second burthen of a former child O that record could with a backward look Even of five hundred courses of the sun Show me your image in some antique book Since mind at first in character was done That I might see what the old world could say To this composed wonder of your frame Whether we are mended or whether better they Or whether revolution be the same O sure I am the wits of former days To subjects worse have given admiring praise 60 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore So do our minutes hasten to their end Each changing place with that which goes before In sequent toil all forwards do contend Nativity once in the main of light Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight And Time that gave doth now his gift confound Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beautys brow Feeds on the rarities of natures truth And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand 61 Is it thy will thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken While shadows like to thee do mock my sight Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry To find out shames and idle hours in me The scope and tenure of thy jealousy O no thy love though much is not so great It is my love that keeps mine eye awake Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat To play the watchman ever for thy sake For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere From me far off with others all too near 62 Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye And all my soul and all my every part And for this sin there is no remedy It is so grounded inward in my heart Methinks no face so gracious is as mine No shape so true no truth of such account And for my self mine own worth do define As I all other in all worths surmount But when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity Mine own selflove quite contrary I read Self so selfloving were iniquity Tis thee myself that for myself I praise Painting my age with beauty of thy days 63 Against my love shall be as I am now With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn Hath travelled on to ages steepy night And all those beauties whereof now hes king Are vanishing or vanished out of sight Stealing away the treasure of his spring For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding ages cruel knife That he shall never cut from memory My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life His beauty shall in these black lines be seen And they shall live and he in them still green 64 When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced The richproud cost of outworn buried age When sometime lofty towers I see downrased And brass eternal slave to mortal rage When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore And the firm soil win of the watery main Increasing store with loss and loss with store When I have seen such interchange of State Or state it self confounded to decay Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate That Time will come and take my love away This thought is as a death which cannot choose But weep to have that which it fears to lose 65 Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea But sad mortality oersways their power How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea Whose action is no stronger than a flower O how shall summers honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of battring days When rocks impregnable are not so stout Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays O fearful meditation where alack Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid O none unless this miracle have might That in black ink my love may still shine bright 66 Tired with all these for restful death I cry As to behold desert a beggar born And needy nothing trimmed in jollity And purest faith unhappily forsworn And gilded honour shamefully misplaced And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted And right perfection wrongfully disgraced And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tonguetied by authority And folly doctorlike controlling skill And simple truth miscalled simplicity And captive good attending captain ill Tired with all these from these would I be gone Save that to die I leave my love alone 67 Ah wherefore with infection should he live And with his presence grace impiety That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace it self with his society Why should false painting imitate his cheek And steal dead seeming of his living hue Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow since his rose is true Why should he live now nature bankrupt is Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins For she hath no exchequer now but his And proud of many lives upon his gains O him she stores to show what wealth she had In days long since before these last so bad 68 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn When beauty lived and died as flowers do now Before these bastard signs of fair were born Or durst inhabit on a living brow Before the golden tresses of the dead The right of sepulchres were shorn away To live a second life on second head Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay In him those holy antique hours are seen Without all ornament it self and true Making no summer of anothers green Robbing no old to dress his beauty new And him as for a map doth Nature store To show false Art what beauty was of yore 69 Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned But those same tongues that give thee so thine own In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown They look into the beauty of thy mind And that in guess they measure by thy deeds Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds But why thy odour matcheth not thy show The soil is this that thou dost common grow 70 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect For slanders mark was ever yet the fair The ornament of beauty is suspect A crow that flies in heavens sweetest airSo thou be good slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater being wooed of time For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love And thou presentst a pure unstained prime Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days Either not assailed or victor being charged Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise To tie up envy evermore enlarged If some suspect of ill masked not thy show Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 71 No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell Nay if you read this line remember not The hand that writ it for I love you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot If thinking on me then should make you woe O if I say you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay Do not so much as my poor name rehearse But let your love even with my life decay Lest the wise world should look into your moan And mock you with me after I am gone 72 O lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love After my death dear love forget me quite For you in me can nothing worthy prove Unless you would devise some virtuous lie To do more for me than mine own desert And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart O lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue My name be buried where my body is And live no more to shame nor me nor you For I am shamed by that which I bring forth And so should you to love things nothing worth 73 That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves or none or few do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west Which by and by black night doth take away Deaths second self that seals up all in rest In me thou seest the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie As the deathbed whereon it must expire Consumed with that which it was nourished by This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong To love that well which thou must leave ere long 74 But be contented when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away My life hath in this line some interest Which for memorial still with thee shall stay When thou reviewest this thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee The earth can have but earth which is his due My spirit is thine the better part of me So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life The prey of worms my body being dead The coward conquest of a wretchs knife Too base of thee to be remembered The worth of that is that which it contains And that is this and this with thee remains 75 So are you to my thoughts as food to life Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground And for the peace of you I hold such strife As twixt a miser and his wealth is found Now proud as an enjoyer and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure Now counting best to be with you alone Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure Sometime all full with feasting on your sight And by and by clean starved for a look Possessing or pursuing no delight Save what is had or must from you be took Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day Or gluttoning on all or all away 76 Why is my verse so barren of new pride So far from variation or quick change Why with the time do I not glance aside To newfound methods and to compounds strange Why write I still all one ever the same And keep invention in a noted weed That every word doth almost tell my name Showing their birth and where they did proceed O know sweet love I always write of you And you and love are still my argument So all my best is dressing old words new Spending again what is already spent For as the sun is daily new and old So is my love still telling what is told 77 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear And of this book this learning mayst thou taste The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show Of mouthed graves will give thee memory Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know Times thievish progress to eternity Look what thy memory cannot contain Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find Those children nursed delivered from thy brain To take a new acquaintance of thy mind These offices so oft as thou wilt look Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book 78 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly Have added feathers to the learneds wing And given grace a double majesty Yet be most proud of that which I compile Whose influence is thine and born of thee In others works thou dost but mend the style And arts with thy sweet graces graced be But thou art all my art and dost advance As high as learning my rude ignorance 79 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid My verse alone had all thy gentle grace But now my gracious numbers are decayed And my sick muse doth give an other place I grant sweet love thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of and pays it thee again He lends thee virtue and he stole that word From thy behaviour beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek he can afford No praise to thee but what in thee doth live Then thank him not for that which he doth say Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay 80 O how I faint when I of you do write Knowing a better spirit doth use your name And in the praise thereof spends all his might To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame But since your worth wide as the ocean is The humble as the proudest sail doth bear My saucy bark inferior far to his On your broad main doth wilfully appear Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat He of tall building and of goodly pride Then if he thrive and I be cast away The worst was this my love was my decay 81 Or I shall live your epitaph to make Or you survive when I in earth am rotten From hence your memory death cannot take Although in me each part will be forgotten Your name from hence immortal life shall have Though I once gone to all the world must die The earth can yield me but a common grave When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie Your monument shall be my gentle verse Which eyes not yet created shall oerread And tongues to be your being shall rehearse When all the breathers of this world are dead You still shall live such virtue hath my pen Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men 82 I grant thou wert not married to my muse And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject blessing every book Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue Finding thy worth a limit past my praise And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days And do so love yet when they have devised What strained touches rhetoric can lend Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized In true plain words by thy truetelling friend And their gross painting might be better used Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused 83 I never saw that you did painting need And therefore to your fair no painting set I found or thought I found you did exceed That barren tender of a poets debt And therefore have I slept in your report That you yourself being extant well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow This silence for my sin you did impute Which shall be most my glory being dumb For I impair not beauty being mute When others would give life and bring a tomb There lives more life in one of your fair eyes Than both your poets can in praise devise 84 Who is it that says most which can say more Than this rich praise that you alone are you In whose confine immured is the store Which should example where your equal grew Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory But he that writes of you if he can tell That you are you so dignifies his story Let him but copy what in you is writ Not making worse what nature made so clear And such a counterpart shall fame his wit Making his style admired every where You to your beauteous blessings add a curse Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse 85 My tonguetied muse in manners holds her still While comments of your praise richly compiled Reserve their character with golden quill And precious phrase by all the Muses filed I think good thoughts whilst other write good words And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen To every hymn that able spirit affords In polished form of well refined pen Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true And to the most of praise add something more But that is in my thought whose love to you Though words come hindmost holds his rank before Then others for the breath of words respect Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect 86 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse Bound for the prize of all too precious you That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead No neither he nor his compeers by night Giving him aid my verse astonished He nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence As victors of my silence cannot boast I was not sick of any fear from thence But when your countenance filled up his line Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine 87 Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing And like enough thou knowst thy estimate The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing My bonds in thee are all determinate For how do I hold thee but by thy granting And for that riches where is my deserving The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting And so my patent back again is swerving Thyself thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking So thy great gift upon misprision growingComes home again on better judgement making Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter In sleep a king but waking no such matter 88 When thou shalt be disposed to set me light And place my merit in the eye of scorn Upon thy side against my self Ill fight And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn With mine own weakness being best acquainted Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted That thou in losing me shalt win much glory And I by this will be a gainer too For bending all my loving thoughts on thee The injuries that to my self I do Doing thee vantage doublevantage me Such is my love to thee I so belong That for thy right my self will bear all wrong 89 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault And I will comment upon that offence Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt Against thy reasons making no defence Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill To set a form upon desired change As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will I will acquaintance strangle and look strange Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell Lest I too much profane should do it wrong And haply of our old acquaintance tell For thee against my self Ill vow debate For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate 90 Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow And do not drop in for an afterloss Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow Come in the rearward of a conquered woe Give not a windy night a rainy morrow To linger out a purposed overthrow If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last When other petty griefs have done their spite But in the onset come so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortunes might And other strains of woe which now seem woe Compared with loss of thee will not seem so 91 Some glory in their birth some in their skill Some in their wealth some in their bodys force Some in their garments though newfangled ill Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure Wherein it finds a joy above the rest But these particulars are not my measure All these I better in one general best Thy love is better than high birth to me Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs Of more delight than hawks and horses be And having thee of all mens pride I boast Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take All this away and me most wretched make 92 But do thy worst to steal thyself away For term of life thou art assured mine And life no longer than thy love will stay For it depends upon that love of thine Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs When in the least of them my life hath end I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humour doth depend Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie O what a happy title do I find Happy to have thy love happy to die But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not 93 So shall I live supposing thou art true Like a deceived husband so loves face May still seem love to me though altered new Thy looks with me thy heart in other place For there can live no hatred in thine eye Therefore in that I cannot know thy change In manys looks the false hearts history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show 94 They that have power to hurt and will do none That do not do the thing they most do show Who moving others are themselves as stone Unmoved cold and to temptation slow They rightly do inherit heavens graces And husband natures riches from expense They are the lords and owners of their faces Others but stewards of their excellence The summers flower is to the summer sweet Though to it self it only live and die But if that flower with base infection meet The basest weed outbraves his dignity For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 95 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which like a canker in the fragrant rose Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose That tongue that tells the story of thy days Making lascivious comments on thy sport Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise Naming thy name blesses an ill report O what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee Where beautys veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see Take heed dear heart of this large privilege The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge 96 Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport Both grace and faults are loved of more and less Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteemed So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated and for true things deemed How many lambs might the stern wolf betray If like a lamb he could his looks translate How many gazers mightst thou lead away If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state But do not so I love thee in such sort As thou being mine mine is thy good report 97 How like a winter hath my absence been From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year What freezings have I felt what dark days seen What old Decembers bareness everywhere And yet this time removed was summers time The teeming autumn big with rich increase Bearing the wanton burden of the prime Like widowed wombs after their lords decease Yet this abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit For summer and his pleasures wait on thee And thou away the very birds are mute Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer That leaves look pale dreading the winters near 98 From you have I been absent in the spring When proudpied April dressed in all his trim Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue Could make me any summers story tell Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew Nor did I wonder at the lilys white Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose They were but sweet but figures of delight Drawn after you you pattern of all those Yet seemed it winter still and you away As with your shadow I with these did play 99 The forward violet thus did I chide Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells If not from my loves breath The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed The lily I condemned for thy hand And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair The roses fearfully on thorns did stand One blushing shame another white despair A third nor red nor white had stoln of both And to his robbery had annexed thy breath But for his theft in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death More flowers I noted yet I none could see But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee 100 Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long To speak of that which gives thee all thy might Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem In gentle numbers time so idly spent Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem And gives thy pen both skill and argument Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey If time have any wrinkle graven there If any be a satire to decay And make times spoils despised everywhere Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife 101 O truant Muse what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed Both truth and beauty on my love depends So dost thou too and therein dignified Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay But best is best if never intermixed Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be praised of ages yet to be Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he shows now 102 My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming I love not less though less the show appear That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming The owners tongue doth publish every where Our love was new and then but in the spring When I was wont to greet it with my lays As Philomel in summers front doth sing And stops her pipe in growth of riper days Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night But that wild music burthens every bough And sweets grown common lose their dear delight Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue Because I would not dull you with my song 103 Alack what poverty my muse brings forth That having such a scope to show her pride The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace Were it not sinful then striving to mend To mar the subject that before was well For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell And more much more than in my verse can sit Your own glass shows you when you look in it 104 To me fair friend you never can be old For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such seems your beauty still three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers pride Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was beautys summer dead105 Let not my love be called idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my songs and praises be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant"

found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively I did consent And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth sufferd My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange Twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful She wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd That heaven had made her such a man she thankd me And bade me if I had a friend that lovd her I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake She lovd me for the dangers I had passd And I lovd her that she did pity them This only is the witchcraft I have usd Here comes the lady Let

dost I shall never love thee after Why thou silly gentleman RODERIGO It is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician IAGO O villainous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guineahen I would change my humanity with a baboon RODERIGO What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it IAGO Virtue a fig Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion RODERIGO It cannot be IAGO It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moorput money in thy pursenor he his to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in their wills Fill thy purse with money The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida She must change for youth When she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change she must Therefore put money in thy purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning Make all the money thou canst If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money A pox of drowning thyself It is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her RODERIGO Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue IAGO Thou art sure of me Go make money I have told thee often and I retell thee again and again I hate the Moor My cause is hearted thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will have more of this tomorrow Adieu RODERIGO Where shall we meet i the morning IAGO At my lodging RODERIGO Ill be with thee betimes IAGO Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo RODERIGO What say you IAGO No more of drowning do you hear RODERIGO I am changed Ill sell all my land Exit IAGO Thus do I ever make my fool my purse For I mine own gaind knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets He has done my office I know not if t be true But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety He holds me well The better shall my purpose work on him Cassios a proper man Let me see now To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery How how Lets see After some time to abuse Othellos ear That he is too familiar with his wife He hath a person and a

such wight were DESDEMONA To do what IAGO To suckle fools and chronicle small beer DESDEMONA O most lame and impotent conclusionDo not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husbandHow say you Cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor CASSIO He speaks home madam You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar IAGO Aside He takes her by the palm Ay well said whisper With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good well kissed an excellent courtesy Tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clysterpipes for your sake Trumpets within The Moor I know his trumpet CASSIO Tis truly so DESDEMONA Lets meet him and receive him CASSIO Lo where he comes Enter Othello and Attendants OTHELLO O my fair warrior DESDEMONA My dear Othello OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me O my souls joy If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have wakend death And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympushigh and duck again as low As hells from heaven If it were now to die Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate DESDEMONA The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow OTHELLO Amen to that sweet powers I cannot speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords be They kiss That eer our hearts shall make IAGO Aside O you are well tund now But Ill set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I am OTHELLO Come let us to the castle News friends our wars are done the Turks are drownd How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey you shall be well desird in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comfortsI prithee good Iago Go to the bay and disembark my coffers Bring thou the master to the citadel He is a good one and his worthiness Does challenge much respectCome Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprus Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants IAGO Do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come hither If thou best valiantas they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him RODERIGO With him Why tis not possible IAGO Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed And what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none A slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after A pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already RODERIGO I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition IAGO Blest figs end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor Blessed pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that RODERIGO Yes that I did But that was but courtesy IAGO Lechery by this hand An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embracd together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight For the command Ill layt upon you Cassio knows you not Ill not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister RODERIGO Well IAGO Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell RODERIGO Adieu Exit IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evend with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash For his quick hunting stand the putting on Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness Tis here but yet confusd Knaverys plain face is never seen till usd Exit SCENE II A

She is indeed perfection IAGO Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of

gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled CASSIO To the health of our general MONTANO I am for it lieutenant and Ill do you justice IAGO O sweet England Sings King Stephen was a worthy peer His breeches cost him but a crown He held them sixpence all too dear With that he calld the tailor lown He was a wight of high renown And thou art but of low degree Tis pride that pulls the country down Then take thine auld cloak about thee Some wine ho CASSIO Fore God this is a more exquisite song than the other IAGO Will you hear t again CASSIO No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things Well Gods above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved IAGO Its true good lieutenant CASSIO For mine own part no offence to the general nor any man of quality I hope to be saved IAGO And so do I too lieutenant CASSIO Ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient Lets have no more of this lets to our affairs Forgive us our sins Gentlemen lets look to our business Do not think gentlemen I am drunk This is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left I am not drunk now I can

drink rock not his cradle MONTANO It were well The general were put in mind of it Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils is not this true Enter Roderigo IAGO Aside to him How now Roderigo I pray you after the lieutenant go Exit Roderigo MONTANO And tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second

He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety What is the matter masters Honest Iago that looks dead with grieving Speak who began this On thy love I charge thee IAGO I do not know Friends all but now even now In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed and then but now As if some planet had unwitted men Swords out and tilting one at others breast In opposition bloody I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it OTHELLO How comes it Michael you are thus forgot CASSIO I pray you pardon me I cannot speak OTHELLO Worthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure whats the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler Give me answer to it MONTANO Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger Your officer Iago can inform you While I spare speech which something now offends me Of all that I do know nor know I aught By me thats said or done amiss this night Unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us OTHELLO Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way Zounds if I stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approvd in this offence Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety Tis monstrous Iago who begant MONTANO If partially affind or leagud in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier IAGO Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determind sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamour as it so fell out The town might fall in fright he swift of foot Outran my purpose and I returnd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I neer might say before When I came back For this was brief I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter cannot I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass OTHELLO I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love"

have provided that I shall have much help from you How had you been my friends else Why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf And thus far I confirm you O you gods think I what need we have any friends if we should neer have need of em They were the most needless creatures living should we neer have use for em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious comfort tis to have so many like brothers commanding one

their hands dancing and playing APEMANTUS Hoyday What a sweep of vanity comes this way They dance They are madwomen Like madness is the glory of this life As this pomp shows to a little oil and root We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves And spend our flatteries to drink those men Upon whose age we void it up again With poisonous spite and envy Who lives thats not depraved or depraves Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves Of their friends gift I should fear those that dance before me now Would one day stamp upon me T has been done Men shut their doors against a setting sun The Lords rise from table with much adoring of Timon and to show their loves each singles out an Amazon and all dance men with women a lofty strain or two to the hautboys and cease TIMON You have done

How now What news THIRD SERVANT Please you my lord that honourable gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company tomorrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds TIMON Ill hunt with him and let them be received Not without fair reward Exit Servant FLAVIUS Aside What will this come to He commands us to provide and give great gifts And all out of an empty coffer Nor will he know his purse or yield me this To show him what a beggar his heart is Being of no power to make his wishes good His promises fly so beyond his state That what he speaks is all in debt he owes For every word He is so kind that he now Pays interest for t his lands put to their books Well would I were gently put out of office Before I were forced out Happier is he that has no friend to feed Than such that do een enemies exceed I bleed inwardly for my lord Exit TIMON You do yourselves much wrong You bate too much of your own merits Here my lord a trifle of our love SECOND LORD With more than common thanks I will receive it THIRD LORD O hes the very soul of bounty TIMON And now I remember my lord you gave good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on Tis yours because you liked it THIRD LORD O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that TIMON You may take my word my lord I know no man Can justly praise but what he does affect I weigh my friends affection with mine own Ill tell you true Ill call to you ALL LORDS O none so welcome TIMON I take all and your several visitations So kind to heart tis not enough to give Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends And neer be weary

lord FIRST LORD We are so virtuously bound TIMON And so am I to you SECOND LORD So infinitely endeared TIMON All to you Lights more lights FIRST LORD The best of happiness honour and fortunes keep with you Lord Timon TIMON Ready for his friends Exeunt all but Apemantus and Timon APEMANTUS What a coils here Serving of becks and jutting out of bums I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums That are given for em Friendships full of dregs Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies TIMON Now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen I would be good to thee APEMANTUS No Ill nothing for if I should be bribed too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster Thou givst so long Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly What needs these feasts pomps and vainglories TIMON Nay an you begin to rail on society once I am sworn not to give regard to you Farewell and come with better music Exit APEMANTUS So Thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then Ill lock thy heaven from thee O that mens ears should be To counsel deaf but not to flattery Exit ACT II SCENE I Athens A room in a senators house Enter a Senator with papers SENATOR And late five thousand To Varro and to Isidore He owes nine thousand besides my former sum Which makes it fiveandtwenty Still in motion Of raging
